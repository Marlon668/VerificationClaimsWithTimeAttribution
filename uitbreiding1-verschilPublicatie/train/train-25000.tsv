pomt-02001	Brazil built a $300 million stadium in the Amazon rainforest that "is only going to be used for four World Cup games," and there’s no team "that can fill it afterwards."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/11/john-oliver/john-oliver-says-new-soccer-stadium-world-cup-will/	The eyes of international soccer fans are trained on Brazil, the country hosting the World Cup that kicks off Thursday. There is excitement for the month-long tournament played every four years. But in Brazil, there is also unrest. Disappointed Brazilians are protesting the country’s spending of more than $11 billion on infrastructure upgrades and stadiums to get ready for the tournament, with games spread across 12 cities in a country larger than the continental United States. Another sore spot is the role of soccer’s governing body, the Federation Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, which chose Brazil as the host country and will reap most of the profits from the mega event. Soccer fan and comedian John Oliver, host of HBO’s Last Week Tonight, sought to illuminate soccer’s dark side in his June 8 show. One project that epitomizes World Cup waste, he argued, is a new 42,000-seat stadium in a city within the Amazon rainforest that cost the country more than $300 million to build. The city of Manaus is way, way, way off the beaten path. To emphasize how out of the way it is, Oliver pulled a TV news clip describing how stadium materials were shipped by boat from Portugal across the Atlantic Ocean and up the Amazon River. "Okay, that does seem like a waste of money, especially when you consider that that stadium is only going to be used for four World Cup games," Oliver said. "There’s also no team in Manaus that can fill it afterwards, at which point it becomes the world’s most expensive bird toilet." We wanted to explore whether the stadium’s only real purpose is four World Cup games. FIFA requires eight venues for the tournament’s 64 matches, but Brazil selected 12 host cities. What seemed like an opportunity to share development, tourism and growth has posed logistical and financial problems around the country. Citing unfinished roads, stadiums and work areas, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro admitted "we made a mistake" in choosing a dozen hosts. Manaus, located in the northwestern Brazilian state of Amazonas, may be the most peculiar choice. The historic city of 2 million attracts business from electronics and oil industries thanks to its status as a free economic zone. Still, it’s mostly accessible by boat and air, nestled near the famous "Meeting of the Waters," where the black Rio Negro and muddy Amazon meet but do not mix. Getting a World Cup-ready stadium ready in Manaus was an enormous feat, generating attention from the the Miami Herald, The New York Times, The Telegraph, the Los Angeles Times and Canada’s CBC News, to name a few. An existing stadium with just 20,000 seats had to be torn down in order to build a stadium that meets FIFA regulations. Its replacement, the German-designed Arena Amazonia, looks like a giant woven straw basket, the seats inside painted in shades of tropical fruit. The project got off to a slow start, and three men died during construction and there are questions whether the playing surface will be in decent shape. As Oliver said, it will host just four games -- the first on June 14 between England and Italy. The U.S. team will face Portugal there June 22. The other matches are Cameroon vs. Croatia and Honduras vs. Switzerland. So what’s next after the four World Cup matches? Manaus is not home to a top-tier Brazilian soccer team that might sustain big crowds when the World Cup is gone. The Miami Herald reported nonspecific plans for the stadium to host guest matches between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo teams. A local team in the country’s fourth soccer division, Nacional Futebol Clube, plans to play in the stadium when the World Cup ends. But a report from the Telegraph, and others, highlights low attendance figures of up to 1,000 fans for the team’s games. The Manaus stadium seats 42,000 people. "We were careful with our wording to say that there is no ‘team in Manaus that can fill it afterwards’ — not to say that no one was going to play in it afterwards," reads a statement from the show’s research team via an HBO spokeswoman. "We knew that there are plans to use the stadium for other purposes, too, and that some people hope the stadium will bring increased popularity to the Nacional team. "But we felt like we were justified to have a deep skepticism about those claims, especially given the cost just to maintain the facility — and we felt we were on safe ground to word the joke the way we had it." This stadium is not the only project deemed by some as a "white elephant." Brazilian soccer star-turned-congressman Romário told the New York Times in 2013 that new stadiums in Manaus, Cuiaba and Natal "are absurd." "There will be a couple games there and then what? Who will go? It is an absolute waste of time and money," he said. FIFA spokeswoman Delia Fisher stressed that the government owns the stadium, not FIFA, and there are plans to "privatize" it after the World Cup. FIFA’s website says the stadium in Manaus "will continue to attract tourists after the tournament by hosting concerts and cultural events." The 2016 Olympics will also be in Brazil, but the soccer matches and other Olympic events will take place in the host city of Rio de Janeiro or surrounding cities, a four-hour flight to the south and east from Manaus. Our ruling Oliver said Brazil built a $300 million stadium in the Amazon rainforest that "is only going to be used for four World Cup games," and there’s no team "that can fill it afterwards." His point is accurate. There are hopes and dreams for the stadium’s life when the World Cup is over, and locals hope it spurs more interest in local soccer teams in Manaus and can be used for big-ticket concerts and conferences. But the stadium, based on what we know, largely will sit unused. We rate Oliver’s claim True.	None	John Oliver	None	None	None	2014-06-11T12:02:39	2014-06-08	['Brazil']
pomt-03877	Under Gov. John Kasich’s budget proposal, "the top one percent in Ohio will pay $10,000 less in income tax each year, but Ohio’s working and middle class families will pay more."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/07/dan-ramos/state-sen-dan-ramos-says-top-earners-would-pay-les/	Gov. John Kasich’s proposed tax overhaul would affect the pocketbooks of all Ohioans – whether for good or for ill is a source of disagreement among state lawmakers. The Republican governor’s plan aims to reduce income taxes for all Ohioans by 20 percent, shave down sales tax to 5 percent while broadening the sales-tax base to include previously tax-exempt services, and slash in half taxes on most small-business income. Kasich also wants to reform oil and gas severance taxes. The tax plan is drummed up by Kasich’s administration as a victory for all Ohio taxpayers. But Rep. Dan Ramos, a Lorain Democrat, is among those who liken the budget proposal to a shell game only Ohio’s upper crust can win. "Under [Kasich’s] plan, the top one percent in Ohio will pay $10,000 less in income tax each year, but Ohio’s working and middle class families will pay more," Ramos said Feb. 19 in a written statement. PolitiFact Ohio decided to audit the representative’s numbers. Ramos’ office said the assertion draws from a study released by left-leaning think tank Policy Matters Ohio, which cites calculations by the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The numbers released in February by ITEP show that the top one percent of Ohio taxpayers, with a mean income above $335,000, would save an average of $10,369 each year. Ohioans earning less than $18,000 would, on average, pay an additional $63 in taxes. ITEP further asserts that Kasich’s proposed tax reform would typically result in a net loss for Ohioans making up to $51,000 each year. But how did ITEP get its numbers? The non-profit said it uses an elaborate microsimulation tax model that calculates the impact of changes to current tax law at the federal and state level. Among the stratified data used in the model are a large sample of federal tax returns, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Surveys and Census Bureau American Community Surveys, they said. The New York Times has lauded the credibility of the model and Bloomberg has used the model’s calculations as reporting tools. For Ohio, ITEP factored Kasich’s proposed tax revamps – minus his severance tax plan – into its calculations and delivered its findings to Policy Matters Ohio. That’s where Ramos picked up the figures and used them in his argument that Kasich’s plan would "shift the burden of taxes from the shoulders of those who have to the shoulders of those who have not." And Ramos is mostly correct. The numbers are credible, but Ramos’s statement implies that every working and middle-class family would pay more under the reform. According to the ITEP numbers, 20 percent of Ohioans earn between $51,000 and $78,000 per year, and would begin to see an average yearly savings of about $75. The line between middle- and upper-class incomes is up for debate – not one to be defined absolutely by PolitiFact Ohio – but it’s safe to say that a yearly income of $51,000 is a far cry from upper-class. Ramos was correct in describing the tax benefit to Ohioans with the highest incomes, but he wrongly implied that all working and middle-class families would take a hit under Kasich’s plan. For that, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Dan Ramos	None	None	None	2013-03-07T15:16:27	2013-02-19	['Ohio', 'John_Kasich']

pomt-09400	Florida's legal challenge of the federal health care bill is "bipartisan."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/23/bill-mccollum/florida-bill-mccollum-health-care-lawsuit/	Florida Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum says politics isn't the reason for his legal challenge to the landmark health care bill signed into law by President Barack Obama. To help make the point, McCollum says the 22-page suit filed in a Pensacola federal court on March 23, 2010, is "bipartisan." "This bipartisan effort by attorneys general around the country should put the federal government on notice that we will not tolerate the constitutional rights of our citizens and the sovereignty of our states to be trampled on," McCollum said in a press release announcing the lawsuit. "This law represents an unprecedented encroachment on the liberty of the American people, and I will pursue this litigation to the highest court if necessary." The lawsuit argues that the federal government cannot impose taxes or financial penalties on someone who fails to have health insurance. Given how polarized the health care debate has become, we wondered how "bipartisan" the suit truly was. Thirteen attorneys general have signed on. They are: McCollum, Florida Henry McMaster, South Carolina (R) Jon Bruning, Nebraska (R) Gregg Abbott, Texas (R) Mark Shurtleff, Utah (R) James D. "Buddy" Caldwell, Louisiana (D) Troy King, Alabama (R) Michael A. Cox, Michigan (R) John W. Suthers, Colorado (R) Thomas W. Corbett Jr., Pennsylvania (R) Robert M. McKenna, Washington (R) Lawrence G. Wasden, Idaho (R) Marty J. Jackley, South Dakota (R) Of that list, Caldwell of Louisiana is the lone Democrat. The rest are Republicans. There is no hard and fast definition of bipartisan, but it's quite a stretch to say one out of 13 is bipartisan. As a point of reference, consider two Congressional actions that are almost universally described as bipartisan -- the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the 1996 welfare overhaul. Ninety-eight Democrats and 230 Republicans voted for the welfare reform package in the U.S. House. Another 25 Democrats joined 53 Republicans voting for the bill in the U.S. Senate. No Child Left Behind passed 381-41 in the House with 183 Republicans and 198 Democrats voting for it. It passed 87-10 in the Senate with the support of 44 Republicans and 43 Democrats. McCollum, who is running for governor, claims that his constitutional challenge of the landmark health care bill passed by Congress is a "bipartisan effort." That's pretty misleading when only one out of 13 attorneys general supporting the lawsuit is something other than a Republican. As such, we rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06546	Says that in 2001, Rick Perry spoke favorably of binational health insurance between Mexico and Texas.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/04/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-rick-perry-talked-binational-he/	In the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate, Rick Santorum called Rick Perry soft on illegal immigration, citing the Texas governor's continued support for a state law allowing some children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. Also, Santorum said, Perry "gave a speech in 2001 where he talked about binational health insurance between Mexico and Texas. I mean, I don't even think Barack Obama would be for binational health insurance." We wondered whether Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, was right in insinuating that Perry spoke in favor of binational health insurance in 2001. First, some background: Binational, or "cross-border," health insurance refers to coverage that provides benefits in two countries or in a country other than the one in which an enrollee lives or works. California has been a leader in binational plans, according to a 2010 report by David Warner, a professor at the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs. He told us in an interview that although plan specifics differ, the general idea is for U.S. employers to offer their workers a choice between receiving their health care services exclusively in Mexico or getting standard U.S.-based coverage. Workers may live and work in the United States or may live in Mexico and commute across the border to legally work on the U.S. side. Warner's report says that at least four U.S. insurers offer binational plans that allow enrollees to access networks of providers in Mexico. For example, Blue Shield of California's "Access Baja" option generally restricts enrollees, who must live within 50 miles of the California-Mexico border, to seeking care through providers in the Mexican border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali. Proponents say that because binational plans are cheaper than standard U.S. plans (primarily because health care is cheaper in Mexico), they make it easier for low-income workers to afford coverage. In Texas, the state Department of Insurance told us that it doesn't know of insurers offering cross-border plans. However, it's possible that some employers in the border area do — if they are "self-funded," meaning they bear the financial responsibility and risks of coverage themselves. Such plans are not regulated by the agency. Texas proponents of binational plans have said they could help reduce the uninsured population in the state's border region. In 2010, 43 percent of border residents were uninsured, compared to 23 percent statewide, according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services. Opponents have expressed concerns about the quality of care provided by Mexican health care providers and the inability of the state to monitor it. Back to Perry and his speech. According to an Aug. 31, 2011, Dallas Morning News blog post, Perry mentioned binational health insurance at an August 2001 summit on border issues. It was hosted by the University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg, which is in the Rio Grande Valley about 10 miles from the Texas-Mexico border. According to news articles, the meeting brought together high-level government officials and business leaders from Mexico and the United States, including Norman Mineta, then the U.S. secretary of transportation. An Aug. 23, 2001, Morning News news article said panels at the summit weighed topics such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, water issues and border health concerns. Perry spoke to the gathering on Aug. 22, 2001. According to the text of his remarks, posted on his state website, he was upbeat about increased cooperation and trade between the United States and Mexico. And he called for the two nations to work together to solve shared problems. Perry then touched on infrastructure, trade and water issues before focusing on health care. He singled out several problems in border areas, including a lack of preventive care and the limited availability of medical specialists. "We have much to gain if we work together to expand preventative care and treat maladies unique to this region," Perry said. Perry next said a legislative proposal by then-state Rep. Pat Haggerty, R-El Paso, and state Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., D-Brownsville, "establishes an important study that will look at the feasibility of binational health insurance. This study recognizes that the Mexican and U.S. sides of the border compose one region, and we must address health care problems throughout that region." Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman in the governor’s office, confirmed that Perry's mention of a binational health insurance study referred to a bill passed during the 2001 legislative session that created a committee to "assess the health care needs of the border area" and "the affordability, cost-effectiveness, economic impact, and improved health status achievable through binational health benefit plan coverage." Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Perry's presidential campaign, said the study "ultimately concluded there were numerous barriers to accomplishing" binational health insurance, "and the Legislature took no further action on this concept." The January 2003 report by the Interim Committee on Binational Health Benefit Plan Coverage, first discusses health care concerns in the Texas border region and California's experience with binational health insurance. It then lays out cost savings that binational insurance plans were projected to generate in Texas, as well as legal and practical impediments to implementing them. The report closes with 10 scenarios for moving forward if the Legislature "determines that binational health plans are a viable option to provide affordable health plans." The scenarios range from changing state law covering health maintenance organizations to allow for binational options to setting up a pilot project that would allow the plans to be offered in one part of the border region. In 2007, Sen. Lucio and Rep. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio, introduced proposals to allow for the offering and regulating of "cross border" health benefit plans covering medical services within 75 miles of either side of the border. Those measures died. We asked Perry's campaign whether he favors binational health plan options for border residents and received no response. Separately, we reviewed news accounts and other Perry speeches and statements for signs that Perry talked up binational health insurance before or after his 2001 speech. We found one earlier reference, in an Aug. 6, 2001, "editorial" on the governor’s state website describing how legislation passed during that year's session would help the border region. Perry highlighted the same bill that led to the 2003 report: "We further addressed health care needs through House Bill 2498, which establishes an interim study to provide recommendations for the development of affordable and accessible health care coverage — including the possibility of bi-national health care coverage — along the Texas-Mexico border region." Earlier in 2001, Perry vetoed a measure calling for state health officials to develop a statewide "strategic health plan," including an examination of how increased trade with Mexico had affected the border region. In a statement, Perry said one reason for the veto was "the failure to include a binational approach to developing the plan." "Effective solutions should also involve the cooperation and the commitment" of Mexico, Perry said. Our ruling Perry talked about binational health insurance in a 2001 speech, as Santorum said. However, his dig about Perry's mention wrongly implies that the governor is working to establish binational health insurance. We found no evidence of Perry taking further action in the 10 years since. We rate Santorum's statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, "like" us on Facebook.

pomt-11747	"We’re … getting into the pool of the 100 million people that are not working. That pool is now coming back."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-job-market-getting-non-workers-w/	President Donald Trump took a victory lap on the job market during one of his periodic Cabinet meetings. "Unemployment is at a 17-year low," he said on Dec. 6, 2017. "Very shortly it's going to be at a 19-year low. We think the numbers are going to continue to go down. And we're also getting into the pool of the 100 million people that are not working. That pool is now coming back. As you know, that's not considered in the low employment numbers, which means we have a lot of people that want to get to work, and that will be working." The unemployment rate is indeed at its lowest point since December 2000. But we were curious about Trump’s other assertion -- that would-be workers from a pool of 100 million are coming back into the workforce. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com President Donald Trump at a cabinet meeting on Dec. 6, 2017. (Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images) First off, Trump is in the ballpark when he says that there are 100 million people not working. There are currently 95.4 million people above the age of 16 who are out of the labor force -- meaning neither working nor actively looking for work -- and another 6.5 million people who are unemployed. If you look at the raw number of Americans who are not in the labor force -- people who are not working or looking actively for work -- that figure has risen by 1.02 million since January 2017, an increase of about 1 percent. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate -- or the percentage of people age 16 and up who are either working or actively looking for work -- has been bouncing around in a narrow band since Trump took office -- between 62.7 percent to 63.1 percent -- with no clear trend. While neither of these measures supports Trump’s assertion, each presents an imperfect view of the labor pool by including everyone 16 and up. Those totals are shaped by demographic changes. "Demographic trends such as the aging of the baby boomer cohort have been the primary drivers for the decline in labor force participation," said Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody's Analytics. "We simply have more retirees now because our population is older." If you drill down using statistics that are more targeted to working-age Americans, Trump’s assertion looks more credible. Consider the employment-to-population ratio for Americans age 25 to 54. During Obama’s last 12 months, this measurement rose by half a percentage point. (Rising, for this statistic, is good -- it means a larger percentage of Americans are employed.) But in the first 10 months of Trump’s tenure, the statistic rose by six-tenths of a percentage point. That’s not a radical improvement, but it’s better than his predecessor managed in his final year. Here’s the full chart (with Obama months in blue and Trump months in red): See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com If you look at the raw numbers, the number of non-workers in the 25 to 54 age range has declined by about 691,000 since January 2017. Another statistic also puts the improvement in 2017 in a favorable light. That would be the unemployment rate known as "U-6." This statistic uses a more generous definition of unemployment than the most commonly used measure. The U-6 rate includes not just workers who are officially unemployed but also those who are employed part-time when they would prefer a full-time job, and those who want to work but who haven’t looked for work in the preceding four weeks. In Obama’s final year, this measure dropped by half a percentage point. (A drop is a good sign.) But under Trump, it has dropped by 1.5 percentage points -- three times faster in a shorter period of time. Here’s the full chart: See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com This statistic is an important one for judging Trump’s assertion, because the people who would be driving the declines would specifically be those who find jobs after being unemployed by conventional definitions, plus those who had been forced to work only part time and those who had not looked for work for several months. "President Trump is correct that the ‘pool of non-workers’ continues to shrink," said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless, though he added that it has done so "fairly steadily" since the last quarter of 2011. Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the job site Indeed.com, puts significant stock in the two statistics that support Trump’s statement. "Our view is that the labor market is entering 2018 with strength and momentum, with some room to grow," Kolko said. Finally, it’s worth noting that no president can take full credit for the economy’s achievements (or take full fault for its shortcomings). Many other factors, including the health of the rest of the world economy and changes in demographics and technology, play a role as well. Our ruling Trump said that "we’re … getting into the pool of the 100 million people that are not working. That pool is now coming back." The statistics that shine the most direct light on working-age Americans support Trump’s point. Both the working-age employment-to-population ratio and the U-6 expanded unemployment rate have improved on Trump’s watch. It’s worth noting that they also improved during Obama’s final year, so Trump was fortunate to take office at a time when the economy was already going in the right direction. But the scale of the increase has been bigger under Trump. We rate this statement Mostly True. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-12-07T16:13:49	2017-12-06	['None']

pomt-01423	Says U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland "voted himself health care for life."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2014/oct/08/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-accuse-southerland-seeking-health-care-l/	Gwen Graham and U.S. Rep Steve Southerland are getting some help from their respective national parties in their hotly contested Panhandle Congressional district race. To bolster Graham, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is using a new commercial to revive an old attack. "Congressman Southerland voted himself health care for life," the Sept. 30, 2014, ad says. This claim is followed by a laundry list of actions about which the DCCC thinks voters will dislike. Southerland’s office denied this, and when we’ve looked at this claim before, we took a dim view of such hyperbole. When a pro-Democratic group said Arkansas Republican Rep. Tom Cotton voted in favor of "taxpayer-funded health care for life," PolitiFact rated it Pants On Fire! Let’s see how this claim fares on the Truth-O-Meter. Law of the land This gets a little complicated, so bear with us. The flap stems from the fact that Congress has to abide by the terms of President Barack Obama’s signature health care law as much as you do. Back in 2010, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa attached an amendment to the law requiring members of Congress to obtain health insurance through the exchanges touted by the bill. Before that, lawmakers bought insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, in which federal employees younger than 65 chose a plan and split premiums with the federal government. This is much like the way it works for anyone with an employee-sponsored group plan -- in this case, it’s just that their employer is the U.S. government. If Congress ever repealed Obamacare, the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program would return. And the GOP majority has been trying to repeal Obamacare for years now, voting to do away with or alter the law more than 50 times, depending on what you count. The commercial cites a July 11, 2012, vote on HR 6079, a repeal bill that netted a yes vote from Southerland. The congressman had plenty of other yes votes on similar bills -- his online House profile boasts that he has voted to "to repeal, replace, and defund Obamacare over 40 times." -- but the DCCC pointed to a story in The Hill about this specific instance. "Not only are Republicans helping their insurance company donors, they’re also trying to help themselves," an unnamed Democratic official told The Hill in the July 9 article before the vote. "House Republicans are set to repeal the promise that members of Congress have health care just like everyone else and to restart the perk of lifetime government health care for themselves." Using that for proof is dubious, as the Democrats are basically citing one of their own anonymously as a source. They are essentially laundering a Democratic talking point through a nonpartisan newspaper. So let’s say Obamacare was magically legislated away and the old congressional system returns. Here’s the problem with the claim: Lawmakers and their aides don’t get to use the federal health plan forever. If a politician loses an election or an aide leaves their congressional job, they will no longer be eligible for the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. Then, when they turn 65, Medicare will take over, but a lawmaker, if they choose, can keep their current plan in order to pay for things Medicare doesn’t cover. In either case, they still have to keep paying premiums. Meanwhile, in the real world, if a member of Congress is buying an insurance plan off an exchange, that coverage is subject to the same terms as anyone else’s policy. Again, if they don’t pay the premium, they don’t have coverage. That’s hardly guaranteeing any lawmaker lifetime health insurance. Southerland’s office pointed out the Panama City Republican voted in favor of the House’s budget resolution in April 2014. That bill encompassed the GOP’s budget policy, actually stating in part, "Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life." It passed along party lines and was sent to the Senate, where it is stalled. Our ruling The DCCC says Southerland "voted himself health care for life." This is a campaign tactic the Democrats have used before, referring to how members of Congress would get to fall back to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program should Obamacare be repealed and its insurance marketplaces be shuttered.

pomt-08930	Says his office "has already recovered over $2 billion from Wall Street for the workers, retirees, and investors who were harmed."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/26/richard-cordray/wall-street-businesses-have-returned-money-ohio-ri/	It’s good politics to present yourself as fighting for the little guy against the corrupt corporate behemoths of Wall Street. Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray is doing just that, using Wall Street as a punching bag. He has made his fight against financial businesses—or "holding Wall Street accountable" in his words — a central theme of his 2010 campaign. On Cordray’s campaign website, the Democrat trumpets the "major cases" against "the big Wall Street banks and financial institutions" that have "caused widespread financial damage to Ohioans." Cordray’s most eye-popping claim of reining in fat cat financiers is that "his office has already recovered over $2 billion from Wall Street for the workers, retirees, and investors who were harmed." That’s a mountain of money — and the kind of thing we at PolitiFact like to check out. Cordray reaches his "recovered over $2 billion" figure by totaling the settlements relating to lawsuits against UnitedHealth ($922 million), Merrill Lynch ($475 million), Marsh & McLennan Cos. ($400 million) and secondary defendants in a case against AIG ($284.5 million). Do the math and you get a tad over $2 billion — $2,081,500,000 if you want to get specific. Because Cordray has only been in office since January 2009, his claim to have "recovered" $97.5 million from accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the secondary defendants in the AIG case, is on the shakiest ground. That’s because the settlement was reached on Oct. 3, 2008, when the Ohio Attorney General was Nancy Rogers. She even sent out a news release praising the settlement. Cordray’s campaign argues that it still should count because the primary case against AIG was still being litigated -- his office on July 16 announced a final, $725 million settlement in the case -- and there is a contested appeal that could affect the PricewaterhouseCoopers settlement. Frankly, we aren’t convinced, and drop Cordray’s total from just above $2 billion to just below $2 billion for adding in that settlement. However, that isn’t the only quibble we have with Corday’s $2 billion figure. A more basic question is what exactly does "Wall Street" mean? We thought of traders on the crowded floors of stock exchanges and the famous statue of the Merrill Lynch bull in lower Manhattan. Cordray’s campaign says they used a broad definition that includes "any publicly traded companies that negatively affected the value of their stock" and harmed Ohio workers, retirees and investors. That somewhat elastic definition can be stretched so that Wall Street includes UnitedHealth, a health care giant whose main corporate offices are in Minneapolis — a 20-hour drive from New York’s Wall Street financial district. We think that a reasonable person would find that more than a bit of stretch to say that a health care company based more than 1,200 miles from Manhattan is a "Wall Street" company. Put another way: What would you say to a friend who claimed to work on Wall Street, if they were employed by United Health in Minneapolis? Beyond just the location and United Health’s industry, Cordray’s use of the $922 million settlement for UnitedHealth has another issue — the $922 million isn’t money that United Health executives forked over to the state of Ohio. Instead, it’s $804 million worth of improperly granted stock options to corporate executives at United Health Care that were canceled as part of the settlement, as well as $126 million from pulled back cash bonuses, retirement packages and health care packages for the executives. (We know that adds up to $930 million, but for whatever reason Cordray has used a $922 million figure for this settlement.) While Cordray’s campaign says that’s money being returned back into the company’s bottom line, Washington and Lee Professor Lymon Johnson, a nationally recognized expert in stock options and corporate law, said that’s not exactly the case. "By canceling out those stock options, you are stopping them (the executives) from taking greater advantage of the company, but that’s not the same thing as money going back into the corporate till," Johnson said. However, he does say that if the stock options were exercised by the United Health executives that it would have affected the company’s stock price by "diluting" the value of the stock held by others. Still, Johnson asserts, "I don’t know that I would use the term recover." "Recovery suggests that the thief got away and that you chased him down and got what he stole back," he said. "In this case, it’s more like you prevented it from happening—he didn’t really get away with the theft." Because Cordray is taking credit for a $97.5 million settlement done by his predecessor and because $804 million worth of canceled stock options from a Minneapolis-based health care company account for almost half of his "over $2 billion recovered" from "Wall Street," we find his claim to be Half True.

pomt-07997	The health care reform law "offset[s] 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/15/eric-cantor/cantor-says-health-care-reform-collects-1o-years-t/	Newly elected House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and his colleagues are wasting no time following through on promises to attempt a repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care reform bill. A challenge for House Republicans has been finding a way around their own new rules, which require that nearly all proposed legislation is paid for. So the GOP exempted the repeal -- which is estimated by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office to increase the deficit by $230 billion over 10 years -- from the requirement. Cantor issued a statement last week reinforcing what he sees as the need for the repeal. "Despite claims that this trillion dollar bill would reduce deficits and save taxpayer dollars, the new law is riddled with budget gimmicks that double count savings, offset 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases, and rely on cuts to Medicare and tax increases to fund a new entitlement," Cantor said. We wondered about the oft-repeated assertion that the law would offset six years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases. Asked for a source, Cantor’s deputy press secretary Megan Whittemore replied: "By law, ObamaCare implements new taxes and fees to ‘pay for’ new subsides aka benefits. With regard to the question about offsetting six years of benefits with ten years of tax increases, the law raises taxes and fees immediately upon enactment – as we have already seen – while not paying out for the cost of benefits contained within the law until 2014. Thus, the 10-year period scored by the CBO only accounts for the cost of 6 years of benefits actually going out the door, compared to 10 years of taxes and fees coming in." Looking at the big picture, that’s not entirely true. As PolitiFact has previously reported, two of the highest-profile and most significant elements of the bill start in 2014, roughly four years after the law took effect last year. The virtual marketplaces known as the health care exchanges would start that year, enabling those who are uninsured or who do not have access to coverage through a large employer to buy affordable plans. Also starting that year would be subsidies to help people buy coverage on the exchange. In addition, that's the year for a major expansion in eligibility for Medicaid. And a 10-year phase out of the "doughnut hole" -- the gap in Medicare drug coverage -- began last year. So, Cantor’s argument that the "benefits" don’t kick in until 2014 is true if you’re looking at the biggest provisions of the law. But many other, smaller provisions to boost coverage have already taken effect. As PolitiFact has previously reported, there are plenty of examples: • Small business tax credits. From 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost. • Coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Soon after enactment, people with pre-existing conditions who haven't had coverage for at least six months could obtain coverage through a "high-risk pool" with subsidized premiums. This would be a temporary solution until the exchanges begin in 2014. • Assistance for early retirees. Starting last year, a temporary reinsurance program will help cut the cost of health coverage for retirees not old enough to be eligible for Medicare. • Dependent coverage to age 26. Shortly after enactment, all insurers were forced to accept dependent coverage for children up to age 26. • No more recisions. Existing plans can no longer terminate beneficiaries when they get sick. • Enhanced preventive care. Soon after enactment, qualified health plans were forced to provide certain preventive services without cost-sharing. Starting this year, patient cost-sharing for preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid are eliminated. The other half of Cantor’s claim is that the taxes kicked in immediately. Some of the tax provisions that help pay for the plan are already in effect. A 10 percent levy on indoor tanning began last year, and an escalating annual fee on drug makers begins this year. Individuals with flexible spending plans and health savings accounts -- tax-advantaged accounts linked to health care expenses -- have already been hit with certain exclusions and limits. But many of the major tax changes will be delayed by a few years. • Medical device taxes. A new levy on medical device makers worth about $20 billion over 10 years kicks in 2013. • Taxes to benefit Medicare Part A. The bill's hike of payroll taxes for individuals earning $200,000 or couples earning $250,000 and a new tax on unearned income for higher earners will start in 2013. • Insurance sector fees. Fees on health insurers totaling $67 billion over 10 years become effective in 2014. • Mandated coverage. Two of the bill's provisions most controversial to Republicans -- the requirement that individuals buy health insurance and that employers of a certain size offer affordable health insurance, under penalty of a fine -- would not begin until 2014. The individual mandate would start low that year and then phase in through 2016. • "Cadillac tax." The most recent version of the bill pushes back the tax on higher-cost health plans until 2018. Now, let’s look at numbers to get a sense of proportion. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress' bipartisan judge of revenue impacts from proposed laws -- the tax provisions collect minimal revenue for 2010, $2.9 billion for 2011 and $5.5 billion for 2012. They only start getting big in 2013, when revenues increase to $31.9 billion, eventually peaking at $86.9 billion in 2019. Indeed, of the total $409.2 billion in increased taxes over the 10-year window, only 10 percent of that amount is raised in the first four years -- the period when, according to Republicans, the government is collecting taxes without providing care. Meanwhile, on the coverage side, it's true that the cost increases significantly four years after enactment. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's Office of the Actuary, the first four years account for about 1 percent of the 10-year cost of increased coverage. The "statement that you have 10 years of taxes and six years of benefits is obviously an oversimplification," said Paul N. Van de Water, Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "But overall, it is generally true that more taxes kick in a little bit earlier than the benefits do." Van de Water said the larger question is whether this is a gimmick and a long-term problem. The answer to that, he said, is no. "Despite the fact that it’s true that some of the taxes kick in on average a bit earlier, by the end of the 10-year period the health reform bill still produces a modest reduction of the deficit, according to the CBO estimate," he said, "and in the subsequent 10-year period the reduction of the deficit gets even larger." Republican leadership has waved off the CBO estimate, saying that it’s misleading. So let’s review. Cantor says the health care reform law "offset[s] 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases." Cantor is correct that the bill's biggest expansions in coverage do not happen until 2014, including the exchanges, the subsidies and the Medicaid expansion. He's also right that some taxation begins well before that. But several of the bill’s most popular provisions -- including no cancelation of health insurance for pre-exisitng conditions and guaranteed coverage of dependents to age 26 -- have taken effect and other components will be implemented before 2014. And only 10 percent taxes that come with health care reform will be levied in the first four years. So we find his claim Half True.

pomt-10613	"And delivered more tax relief than the other Republicans combined."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/18/rudy-giuliani/hard-to-measure-but-hes-a-tax-cutter/	The statement made in a TV ad Rudy Giuliani debuted this week in Florida couldn't be more straightforward. It says Giuliani "delivered more tax relief than the other Republicans combined." As any economist or tax expert will tell you, comparing the candidates on tax issues is a bit like trying to hug a greased pig. Background material provided by the campaign for the ad claims that by the end of Giuliani's term as mayor, New Yorkers' "tax burden" was reduced nearly 20 percent. Under Mike Huckabee, it states, Arkansas residents' state tax burden increased nearly 19 percent; and under Mitt Romney, Massachusetts residents' state tax burden increased about 8 percent. The Giuliani campaign said those numbers were based on the Tax Foundation's method of calculating the percentage of the state income being taken in state tax. The Tax Foundation, which was kind enough to analyze tax burden figures for PolitiFact, came up with slightly lower figures for the increases under Huckabee and Romney: 14 and 7 percent, respectively. But here are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, the Tax Foundation doesn't do those calculations for cities, so the Giuliani campaign's 20 percent figure is one they arrived at themselves. Also, as Bill Ahern of the Tax Foundation points out, the statewide tax burden his group calculates includes local taxes that a governor doesn't control. Ahern also warned that tax burden numbers don't tell the whole story. Each person led in different situations. For example, he said, Huckabee was under court order to increase education spending in Arkansas. "Is that him raising taxes?" Ahern asked. "Well, he signed it." Consider as well, Ahern said, that Romney fought hard to decrease the income tax rate in Massachusetts from 5.3 to 5 percent, but he couldn't persuade the Democrat-controlled legislature to go along with him. "Any honest reading of the record would show he's a tax cutter," Ahern said. The Tax Foundation does not analyze cities, so the Giuliani campaign ran some numbers themselves and came up with the 20 percent decrease in "tax burden." Here's the math, from city controller reports: taxes increased from $18.1-billion to $21.7-billion; the nominal gross city product went from $286-billion to $428-billion; so the total taxes as a percentage of gross city product went from 6.33 percent to 5.07, a 19.88 percent decrease. "By some measure, I'm sure they are correct," said E.J. McMahon, a senior fellow for tax and budgetary studies at the Manhattan Institute. Under Giuliani's watch, the city tax burden fell to its lowest point in three decades, McMahon said. It's an achievement for which he deserves credit, McMahon said, but not all of it. For example, he said, one of the largest tax cuts of the Giuliani era — the elimination of a 12.5 percent income tax surcharge — was actually opposed by Giuliani. As for federal legislators like Sens. John McCain and Fred Thompson, Giuliani's team discounted them altogether. Neither were executives in a state, city, municipality, county or other government, "and thus could not deliver tax cuts." Nachama Soloveichik of the Club for Growth spent months analyzing the candidates' records on taxes. Not an easy task, she said. How do you compare executives like Giuliani to a senator like Thompson? Does he get credit if he voted for a tax cut? There are so many ways to measure budgets, it's hard to get a handle on, Soloveichik said. How do you factor in fees? Nevertheless, the Club for Growth prepared reports on each candidate's record on economic issues. Her conclusion: "It is clear that Giuliani did successfully push through more tax relief than Romney or Huckabee." Given the many confirming sources, it's clear Giuliani has a strong record on tax cutting. However, his claim of delivering "more tax relief than the other Republicans combined" is next to impossible to accurately judge, so we rate the statement in Giuliani's ad Mostly True.

pomt-05636	Metro Atlantans spend "over an hour every day" or "five hours a week" commuting, for a total of "260 hours a year."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/23/metro-atlanta-voter-education-network/ad-commute-takes-260-hours-year/	A new ad about the region’s dismal commutes made us worry that the best years of our lives are passing us by as we sit in traffic. "Metro Atlanta, we have a problem," it says. "One of the longest average commutes in America. Over an hour every day, five hours a week you don’t spend with your family -- 260 hours a year." This made your PolitiFact Georgia team sad. While we’re behind the wheel cursing traffic, we may be missing all of those Hallmark card experiences that are supposed to make the daily grind worthwhile. A daughter’s first steps. Her dance recitals. That magic moment when you realize her boyfriend is no good and you need to run him off with a baseball bat. Is what the ad is saying true? The ad was sponsored by the Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network, a group of businesses and civic groups. They are banding together to tell voters about a July 31 referendum that asks voters to raise sales taxes to fund transportation projects across the region. Leaders hope to raise $6.14 billion over 10 years for a long list of transportation projects. An additional $1 billion would fund county and town projects. Backers say that without it, the region will lose business to other places that are doing more to deal with traffic. The ad was based on data from a February 2012 report from the Georgia Department of Transportation, a MAVEN spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. The report said that the average work commute time in metro Atlanta was 30.3 minutes in 2010, which is up from 30.1 minutes in 2009. The report cited the 2010 American Community Survey, a yearly national survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. It reported times for a 28-county area surrounding Atlanta. The number cited in the commercial is the commute time for people traveling from home to work by all modes of transportation, including riding the train, walking, or using a bicycle. Travel times for those who drive are similar. Those who commute alone in a car, truck or van spent an estimated 29.1 minutes on the road. Those who carpooled spent about 32.6 minutes. If each commute is about 30 minutes, that means the average worker in metro Atlanta spends one hour commuting each day. If you work five days a week, 52 weeks a year, that equals 260 hours, the number cited in the commercial. We found a few problems with this calculation. Commuting expert Alan Pisarski, who frequently writes about transportation issues and testifies before Congress, told PolitiFact Georgia that the American Community Survey is generally the best -- and often only -- source for commute times in metro regions or cities. But the survey is limited. It publishes times for trips to work, not trips home. If you’re trying to find the average time spent commuting during a whole day, multiplying the ACS survey figure by two won’t necessarily give you the right answer. The afternoon commute might be shorter or longer. PolitiFact Georgia also noted that commuters often don’t work all 52 weeks in a year. They often get a couple of weeks worth of vacation. The average time spent commuting each year might not be 260 hours. We hunted for additional data in metro Atlanta, but did not find any recent research. We found nothing that contradicted their numbers, either. So what’s our conclusion? MAVEN’s television ad is based on information from the census that says the average trip to work in the Atlanta region is about 30 minutes. It was a bit of a leap for MAVEN to conclude that based on morning commute data, metro Atlantans spend "over an hour every day" traveling to and from work. The afternoon commute might be longer or shorter. We don’t know because it’s not part of the census data. It was a bigger leap for them to conclude that since the year is 52 weeks long, workers therefore spend "260 hours a year" commuting. Workers often get a week or so of vacation or sick leave. MAVEN’s numbers are OK for a back-of-the-envelope calculation. They’re also within reason. However, metro Atlanta is so big and the commutes can be so different that assuming a trip to work takes as much time as the one back home is a bridge too far. We give MAVEN a Half True.

pomt-09152	"In 20 years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.S. to elect the president by themselves."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/10/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-muslims-will-be-majority-us-20/	Recently, a PolitiFact reader forwarded us a chain e-mail warning about Muslims in America, particularly the threat that the extremists could seek to impose the religious law known as Sharia in the United States. Here's one typical passage from the e-mail, with its original syntax intact: "It is too bad that so many are disillusioned with life and Christianity to accept Muslims as peaceful.. some may be but they have an army that is willing to shed blood in the name of Islam.. the peaceful support the warriors with their finances and own kind of patriotism to their religion. While America is getting rid of Christianity from all public sites and erasing God from the lives of children the Muslims are planning a great jihad on America." The e-mail cites the work of Nonie Darwish, an Egyptian-born American critical of Islam who founded a group called Arabs for Israel. But when we contacted Darwish, she said she had not written or approved the e-mail. As a website that focuses on politics and policy, we zeroed in on one passage that had been marked in red: "In twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.S. to elect the President by themselves! Rest assured they will do so... You can look at how they have taken over several towns in the USA .. Dearborn Mich. is one... and there are others." We thought it would be worth checking to see whether the e-mail is right about how fast the Muslim population is growing. Since the U.S. Census Bureau doesn't ask questions about religious affiliation, there's actually quite a bit of debate over how many Muslims live in the U.S. Without a solid count, studies are often reliant on assumptions and estimating techniques that have prompted skepticism in one quarter or another. The largest estimate we found was 7 million, the number used by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, which is an advocacy group for Muslim-Americans. Academic population experts have produced lower estimates -- between 1.8 million and 2.8 million. We won't wade too far into the debate, because even if the number is on the higher end of this range, the statement in the e-mail is still far off-base. Currently, the total U.S. population is estimated to be roughly 308 million people. Assuming current rates of immigration, the Census Bureau projects that the U.S. population in 2030 -- 20 years from now -- will be 358 million. Of course, minors don't vote, so if you look only at those 18 and over, the current voting-age population is 234 million, a number projected to grow to 276 million by 2030. And if you reduce this number by the proportion of voting-age population that actually votes -- 64 percent in 2008 -- the population actually voting in 2030 would be 177 million. So if you assume that every Muslim living in America (1) would be eligible to vote and (2) would all vote for the same candidate -- assumptions that by themselves aren't the least bit plausible -- there would still need to be more than 88 million Muslims in America in 2030 to be able to "elect the president by themselves," leaving aside the fact that the president is elected indirectly through the electoral college, so a Muslim majority would have to be spread broadly and decisively across the country. The number would actually need to be higher than that to account for Muslims who were eligible to vote but who didn't bother to cast a ballot, but to give the e-mail author the benefit of the doubt, we'll use the smaller figure here. So, even using 7 million as the current figure for the Muslim population -- and the easier-to-reach target of 88 million -- the Muslim population would have to grow roughly thirteen-fold in the space of 20 years to account for a majority of the voting-age population that actually votes. That means adding as many new Muslims in the U.S. as there are today every 19 months until 2030. If you instead assume that Muslims currently account for 2 million of the population, the number of Muslims would have to grow 44-fold in 20 years. That means adding as many new Muslims as there currently are in the U.S. roughly every 5 months until 2030. And if you assume that the Census Bureau's projection for total voting-age population in 2030 remains unchanged at 276 million -- in other words, that the ethnic makeup of the population in 2030 is a zero-sum game -- then the nation's population of non-Muslims would have to plunge by as many Muslims are added, something that could only happen through a catastrophe of unprecedented proportions that killed off tens of millions of Americans yet somehow managed to spare Muslims. Neither the laws of biology nor the laws of immigration would make any of this possible. "Muslims are less than 1 percent of the adult population, and a fair number are non-citizens -- students from foreign countries, or refugees," said Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. "While their number grew appreciably from the 1970s to the 2000s, their growth was no greater than that of a number of other religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism. Even if previous rates of growth continued, Muslims would still remain in the single digits even decades from now." The idea that Muslims will be an electoral majority in 20 years "is absurd," added Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research. Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for CAIR, agreed, saying that "it sounds very far-fetched to me." We agree. We rate the chain e-mail's claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-04140	Says George Washington said a free people should be armed to guard against government tyranny.	false	/texas/statements/2013/jan/03/louie-gohmert/louie-gohmert-says-george-washington-said-free-peo/	Why should ordinary Americans be able to buy semi-automatic weapons designed for the military or law enforcement? That was "Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace’s question to U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, on his Dec. 16, 2012, show, two days after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre. Gohmert answered in part, "For the reason George Washington said a free people should be an armed people. It ensures against the tyranny of the government." We contacted spokeswomen for Gohmert, seeking details on the Washington quotation, but didn’t hear back. But a Web search led us to a similar statement that Washington made in the first State of the Union address, Jan. 8, 1790: "A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined." Experts told us, though, that Washington was calling for a trained militia to defend the new nation, not anticipating a citizens’ stand against their own government’s tyranny. The statement comes near the beginning of Washington’s speech: Among the interesting objects, which will engage your attention, that of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard. To be prepared for War is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace. A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well digested plan is requisite. And their safety and interest require, that they should promote such manufactories, as tend to render them independent on others for essential, particularly for military supplies. The proper establishment of the Troops, which may be deemed indispensable, will be entitled to mature deliberation. Ron Chernow, whose "Washington: A Life" won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for biography, helped us translate that into 21st-century-ese. "In this passage, Washington is talking about national defense policy, not individuals arming themselves, and the need for national self-sufficiency in creating military supplies," Chernow told us by email. John Woolley, co-creator of the American Presidency Project at the University of California-Santa Barbara (where we first saw the speech), also said Washington was speaking about external threats and "not being dependent on imported weapons." "He said that as a practical matter, the young and vulnerable USA needed to be prepared to mount an effective defense against other" nations, Woolley told us by email. The Senate and House both issued formal responses, Woolley said, and "there is no hint in either of these that the members of Congress thought there was something in that speech about gun rights." Washington’s address goes on to say that peaceful measures having failed in regards to "certain tribes of hostile Indians" on the southern and western frontiers, "we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union." The "common defence," being prepared for war and having the ability to protect against hostile tribes all refer to outside threats. Edward Lengel, editor in chief of the Papers of George Washington project at the University of Virginia, told us by email, "Washington never said, to my knowledge, anything about arms providing a safeguard against any so-called ‘tyranny’ of government.’ " In reading the "armed, but disciplined" quotation, Lengel said, "emphasis should be on the word ‘disciplined,’ by which Washington was taking a backhanded swipe at the militia, which he considered undisciplined and next to useless in combat. Washington was all for an ordered, professional standing army under the command of a strong central government." But an army was expensive, as Washington wrote in a May 2, 1783, memo to a congressional committee that asked for his advice on how to organize the military in peacetime. "We are too poor to maintain a standing Army adequate to our defence," he said, and suggested a small regular army supplemented by a well-organized militia -- a part-time force of volunteers, called up in emergencies. The Militia Acts of 1792 tracked with the memo’s description, calling for white men 18 to 45 years old to be enrolled in a militia. A cost-cutting provision required them to provide their own arms and ammunition. So there’s evidence that post-Revolutionary lawmakers expected citizens to own firearms. And, Woolley said, some leaders then undoubtedly "endorsed views like those Mr. Gohmert expresses -- perhaps more precisely, in order to stay free, the people should have the right to be armed." Washington, though, does not appear to have been among them. Lengel said, "The idea of resistance to tyranny being dependent on a nation of gun-wielding individuals acting at their own behest or even on local initiative would have been anathema to Washington. "Indeed, during the (Revolutionary) war he very frequently lamented the crimes carried out by armed civilians or undisciplined militia against their unarmed neighbors. The solution to these crimes, as he understood it, was to increase the power of the government and the army to prevent and punish them -- not to put more guns in the hands of civilians." Mary Thompson, research historian at Washington’s Virginia home, Mount Vernon, told us via email, "Washington’s actual quote is in regard to the people serving in the militia as an arm of the government," rather than as an armed resistance to government. In fact, she said, Washington called up militias to put down just such a rebellion a few years later. During the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, she said, "citizens of Western Pennsylvania rose up to fight a new tax on the whiskey they produced." Washington was "concerned that success by the rebels would lead to a diminishment of the central/federal government," and directed state militias to counter the insurrection -- "citizen-soldiers," she said, "acting on behalf of the government against their fellow citizens." Our ruling Gohmert’s rendering, "George Washington said a free people should be an armed people," seemingly tracks Washington’s words to the nation: "A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined." Contrary to Gohmert’s characterization, though, Washington was not speaking about citizens arming themselves in case of government tyranny. Quite the opposite: The president and former general was calling for disciplined troops to fight on behalf of the government. Gohmert’s statement is False.

pomt-10445	"If Senator Clinton or John McCain had stood up in previous years for increases in fuel efficiency standards . . . then we would not be in this same situation in the first place."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/05/barack-obama/mccain-took-a-stand-years-earlier/	Barack Obama has spent the past couple of weeks deriding Hillary Clinton and John McCain's support for a gas tax "holiday" during the summer driving season, branding it a gimmick that will both worsen the deficit and encourage more oil consumption. Now, he's suggesting both of his Senate colleagues were asleep at the wheel when they had a chance to do something meaningful about federal fuel economy standards. "If Senator Clinton or John McCain had stood up in previous years for increases in fuel efficiency standards, in getting serious about an energy policy that is freeing ourselves from dependence on foreign oil, then we would not be in this same situation in the first place," Obama said during an interview on NBC's "Meet The Press" on May 4, 2008. Though Obama may be fond of scolding his senior colleagues, he's overlooking the fact that McCain played a significant role in trying to raise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAF, standards three years before Obama arrived in the Senate. In 2002, the Arizona senator worked with Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts on a plan that would have raised the CAF standard for cars and light trucks to 36 miles per gallon by 2015. Their proposal, which would have been an amendment to President Bush's energy proposal, never came up for a vote because it was trumped by a competing amendment authored by Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo., that was backed by the auto industry and merely set a deadline to come up with fuel efficiency standards. It would turn out to be McCain's high-water mark advocating for greater fuel economy. He was much less prominent on the issue during the 2005 debate that yielded a comprehensive energy bill (though he did mount an unsuccessful effort with Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., to cap greenhouse gas emissions at 2000 levels) and did not vote at all on Senate passage of a 2007 energy package that set the first statutory increase in vehicle fuel-economy standards in 32 years. Clinton and Obama both voted for the Senate bill. Obama's slap at Clinton's record is perhaps a bit more defensible. During a 2005 energy debate, she voted against an amendment by Obama's Illinois colleague, Democratic Sen. Richard J. Durbin, that would have mandated increases in CAF standards for passenger vehicles, up to an average of 27.5 miles per gallon by 2016. Obama supported the amendment. Clinton was among 19 of the 41 Democrats voting who opposed Durbin's proposal, influenced in part by a Bush administration threat to veto any bill that set specific new standards. It's worth noting that while rising gas prices were a concern back then, the most contentious issues that year were unsuccessful administration efforts to drill for oil and natural gas in the Arctic and separate successful efforts by majority Republicans to shield manufacturers of the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from product liability suits surrounding groundwater contamination. While fuel economy certainly makes for a potent campaign issue at a time when gas prices are surpassing $3.50 a gallon, Obama and Clinton have been apart on other aspects of energy policy. Obama has been an enthusiastic supporter of federal mandates promoting greater use of ethanol and other biofuels, largely because they benefit agricultural interests in his state. Clinton – and McCain, for that matter – have been more skeptical about having the government promote one fuel over another, especially if it's too costly to compete without government help. During another energy debate, in June 2003, Clinton supported a pair of amendments to weaken federal ethanol mandates. However, majorities in both houses supported the alternative fuel, and wound up mandating greatly expanded usage in both the 2005 and 2007 energy laws. Obama's criticism is right on Clinton, but wrong on McCain. Because Obama neglects to recognize McCain's prominent role in a bipartisan effort to legislate increases in federal fuel-economy standards and depicts him as less-than-serious player on the issue, we rule his statement: Half True.

pomt-06502	"Bryce Reeves chaired a group bankrolled by a New York billionaire who fired hundreds of Virginia workers and sent their jobs to China."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/oct/12/edd-houck/houck-says-reeves-ok-shipping-va-jobs-china/	Democratic State Sen. Edd Houck, D-Spotsylvania, is airing a cable television ad charging that his Republican opponent, Bryce Reeves, "is OK" with sending Virginia jobs overseas. "Bryce Reeves chaired a group bankrolled by a New York billionaire who fired hundreds of Virginia workers and sent their jobs to China," the ad’s narrator says. We wondered if it’s true Reeves is linked to a company that sent hundreds of Virginia jobs to China. We started by tracing the Houck campaign’s circuitous route in linking Reeves to the job losses. Reeves in 2009 chaired the Fredericksburg regional chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a national conservative organization advocating less spending, taxes and government. It was a volunteer position Reeves held for a few months, according to Chris Leavitt, Reeves’ campaign manager. Americans for Prosperity was co-founded and gets money from David Koch, a New York billionaire who co-owns Koch Industries. The New Yorker and other publications have reported that Koch and his brother, Charles, have helped finance the rise of the Tea Party in recent years. Koch Industries, based in Wichita, Kansas, owns Invista, a global manufacturer of nylon, spandex and polyester products. In December 2008, Invista, announced plans to lay off 210 employees who made nylon fibers for carpets at a plant in Waynesboro. A Dec. 11, 2008 story in The News Virginian, Waynesboro’s newspaper, said Invista cited the sluggish housing market and decline in the demand for carpet as reasons for the job cuts. The article said many workers might be shifted to spandex production. The story said the nylon job losses were in addition to the layoff of another 135 contractors at the plant just a week earlier. Did those jobs end up being sent to China? To buttress that line of reasoning, Houck’s ad references a December 12, 2008 article in The News Virginian that said while Invista was cutting in Waynesboro, it was expanding operations in China. "Where there’s smoke, there’s fire," Craig Bieber, Houck’s campaign manager, told us. The story, however, did not say the Waynesboro jobs specifically went to China. In an attempt to prove the jobs did go to China, Bieber cited a 2006 Invista news release announcing the company was acquiring Honeywell’s nylon filament business in Asia to make Stainmaster carpets. Bieber told us the jobs losses in Waynesboro fits a pattern of Koch Industries off-shoring jobs. But Bieber could not provide any direct evidence the Waynesboro jobs were shipped to China. And we couldn’t find any, either. The Department of Labor allows U.S. workers to petition the federal government for benefits if their jobs have been lost to international trade. We searched that agency’s website for trade assistance cases involving Invista’s Waynesboro facility. We found a February 2009 Department of Labor decision signing off on trade assistance to Invista employees and contract workers at the plant’s facility whose nylon yarn production work was being shifted to Canada, where the company has three large plants and has been expanding its production of air bags. But we found no decisions saying workers claimed that their jobs were being sent to China. For insight, we repeatedly tried to reach Jim Flickinger, president of the International Brotherhood of DuPont Workers, the union representing workers at the plant. He didn’t call us back. Kenneth Henley, the union’s general counsel, declined comment. "We don’t want to get in the middle of it," he said. Kemp Harr, publisher of Floor Focus Magazine, doubted the Waynesboro jobs went to China. Harr said Invista is faced with a drop in U.S. demand for nylon carpet -- down 40 percent since 2006. "The only thing Invista makes in China is for domestic consumption (in that country)," said Harr, whose publication is based in Chattanooga, Tenn. Invista officials deny that Waynesboro nylon workers’ jobs were sent to China, adding their job loss was due to a "dramatic decline in housing and significantly reduced customer demand for residential carpet." "No nylon workers’ jobs were moved to China," Erica Taylor, an Invista spokeswoman, told us in an email. "Additionally, even though the ad implies otherwise, our owners are not presently involved in Mr. Reeve’s campaign." That gets us to our next point. Houck’s ad uses Reeves’ brief work with a local chapter of Americans For Prosperity chapter to tie him to David Koch, Invista and the company’s 2008 layoffs. "Reeves is OK with sending our jobs to China," the ad’s narrator states. It’s a pretty flimsy argument to link Reeves to the Invista layoffs solely because he once headed a regional group of a national organization that received money from David Koch. It’s even more of a stretch to say that link, tenuous as it is, proves Reeves is OK about sending jobs to China. Leavitt, Reeves’ campaign manager, said the Republican has never commented on the Invista layoffs, adding it was "ridiculous" to suggest he was OK with sending jobs to China. Our ruling: Houck’s ad links Reeves to the 2008 exporting of hundreds jobs from a nylon plant in Waynesboro to China. The charge does not stand up. First, the connection between Reeves and Invista is weak, to say the least. Invista is a subsidiary of Koch Industries, co-owned by billionaire David Koch. Reeves never worked for the company. But Houck says the tie is that Reeves in 2009 chaired the Fredericksburg chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative national organization that Koch co-founded. Secondly, Houck offers no proof that the jobs went directly to China. There’s some strong evidence to the contrary, however: Invista denies it; an industry expert says it’s improbable; and the union filings with the Department of Labor make no such claim. Houck uses a flimsy logic to conclude Reeves "is OK" with shipping Virginia jobs to China. We rate the claim False.

pomt-05653	Says Tennessee has some of the lowest beer excise tax rates in the country.	half-true	/tennessee/statements/2012/mar/20/tax-foundation/tax-foundation-map-shows-tennessee-has-low-beer-ex/	Editor’s note: On Friday we published an item that ruled as False a claim the Tax Foundation made with a map that shows Tennessee ranking among the lowest in the nation in beer excise taxes. That item incorrectly characterized the map, which was labeled "State Beer Excise Tax Rates," as displaying overall tax rates on beer. We have changed the ruling statement to the more narrow definition of "beer excise taxes" and adjusted our ruling. ---- A map published by The Tax Foundation makes it look like Tennesseans can get a cold one without paying too much in taxes. On the March 5 map, titled "State Beer Excise Tax Rates (Dollars Per Gallon)," Tennessee is ranked No. 39, at $0.14 per gallon, well behind the top three states of Alaska ($1.07), Alabama ($1.05) and Georgia ($1.01). This led to media reports saying that Tennessee has some of the lowest beer taxes in the nation, including one blog post that led with: "Tennessee may be in the Bible Belt, but its taxes on beer . . . are among the lowest in the country."" But Linus Hall, brewmaster for one of Tennessee’s most successful craft breweries, Yazoo Brewing, pushed back on Twitter: "Do your homework! TN has 17% wholesale tax on top of excise tax, giving us the highest beer taxes in the country!" Indeed, for years the Tennessee Malt Beverage Association, which represents beer wholesalers, has contended that the taxes Tennesseans pay for beer are among of the highest in the nation, so we decided to look into the claim. The Tax Foundation map lists Tennessee’s flat per-barrel excise tax paid directly to the state, which has for many years stayed constant at $4.29 per barrel. Since there are 31 gallons in a barrel, that translates to about 14 cents per gallon, which is pretty low compared with flat per-barrel rates levied by other states. A color-coded map key puts Tennessee in the "Low Beer Tax" category. An "excise tax" is "an indirect tax charged on the sale of a particular good," according to the website Investopedia. It is considered indirect "because the government does not directly apply the tax. An intermediary, either the producer or merchant, is charged and then must pay the tax to the government." The industry’s national lobbying arm, the Beer Institute, calculates Tennessee’s beer excise tax rate by also including the 17-percent wholesale beer tax referenced by Yazoo’s brewmaster (the Institute does the same thing for Kentucky’s 11-percent wholesale beer tax). That tax, mandated by the state but applied and collected at the local level, pushes Tennessee’s beer tax to $35.61 per barrel, the highest in the nation by the Institute’s rankings (Kentucky moves from 45th in the Foundation rankings to seventh in the Beer Institute’s). Put another way -- in 2010, a total of $16.6 million in beer tax revenue was collected by the state for its flat $4.29 per-barrel tax, but $122 million in beer tax revenue was collected by local governments for the 17-percent wholesale beer tax mandated by the state. For the consumer, these beer taxes are unavoidable, although as any beer-loving resident of a border county can tell you, beer is often cheaper in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia (even if the Tax Foundation map suggests otherwise). We found inconsistencies in the Tax Foundation's map. A footnote says, "Local rates are excluded unless they are statewide and uniform. Alabama and Georgia include statewide local rates." But we found that standard was not applied to Tennessee, which has a 17-percent wholesale tax on beer that is statewide, uniform and mandatory. Including the revenue it produces would push the state to No. 1 on the Tax Foundation’s rankings, just as it is ranked by the Beer Institute. An email challenging our False ruling from Tax Foundation vice president for legal and state projects, Joseph Henchman, said a more appropriate ruling would be "True But Not Comprehensive." Richard Morrison, manager of communications for Tax Foundation, wrote in an email: "Yes, multiple taxes affect the ultimate price of beer in Tennessee – and if we had wanted to do an in-depth study on how the final retail price if beer is affected by all of those taxes, we would have. But that’s not what we did, and it’s not what we said we did." Still, there is that footnote on the map that indicates the Tax Foundation included local tax rates in making Alabama and Georgia Nos. 2 and 3 in its rankings and it also says the ranking includes it applies "sales taxes specific to alcoholic beverages" in Maryland, Minnesota and D.C. So we find the map is inconsistent and misleading. Scott Drenkard, an economist with the Tax Foundation, said the organization got its excise tax figures from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), which represents the liquor industry and had the most recent data available, September 2011. He said it can "get a little hairy" trying to factor in all the various state and local taxes on beer, but in an email Monday said the Tax Foundation’s map attempts to include what he called "statutory" tax rates and not "effective" rates. He also said local alcohol-specific sales taxes were included in calculating the excise tax rate for beer in Arkansas. "A statutory rate is the legally imposed rate, whereas the effective rate is what is actually paid when the smoke clears." He explained later in the email: "The map does not purport to be anything more than it is: a statutory excise tax rate map on beer at the point of sale." Drenkard said the Tax Foundation ultimately determined that the Tennessee wholesale tax on beer, despite being uniform and statewide, fell into the "effective" tax rate category and not the "statutory" one: "Tennessee has a ‘wholesale’ tax levied on the wholesale price, but collected at the retail level. Is this properly considered a wholesale tax, or a retail tax? We think this is simply a judgment call." Rich Foge, a lobbyist for Tennessee’s Malt Beverage Assocation, and Jason Baird, Foge’s counterpart in Kentucky, both were surprised rankings of beer excise rates would exclude the high wholesale beer tax rates in both states. Lester Jones, the Beer Institute’s economist, makes his rankings of beer excise tax rates include things like city-specific beer and alcohol taxes, and says Tennessee and Kentucky’s wholesale beer taxes -- mandated statewide but paid at the local level -- should definitely be included. "If you are going to include local taxes for Georgia and Alabama and other states and not include ours, then that map is false," Foge said. He added that it concerned him that DISCUS, which lobbies for liquor, was used as the Tax Foundation’s source on beer taxes. "Those are our competitors," Foge said. Drenkard said DISCUS figures were used because they were more recent than the Beer Institute’s tables showing breakdowns effective excise beer taxes for 2009 and 2010. Hall, the Yazoo brewmaster, said that by including some local tax rates and not others, he felt the Tax Foundation had created a "misleading" map. "Anybody who wasn’t familiar would look at that map and get the opposite impression of what the truth is," Hall said. Foge contends that even the Beer Institute’s calculation of Tennessee’s highest-in-the-nation $35.61 per barrel in beer taxes doesn’t tell the whole taxing story. That’s because when you buy a six-pack at the supermarket, you also pay sales tax on the purchase – an average of 9.25 percent statewide (state sales tax is 7 percent and local governments can tack on up to another 2.7 percent). See this PolitiFact item for our ruling on Tennessee’s high sales and grocery taxes being among the nation’s highest. The wholesale tax is paid by beer wholesalers based on the value of the beer at wholesale level (including their profit markup), which varies from brand to brand. But when the 17 percent is added, that becomes part of the price at the retail level. Thus, Foge notes, the sales tax is in fact "a tax on taxes." Since the wholesale tax is based on value, it increases as prices increase for beer – as they have over the years. Thus, the wholesale beer tax the state mandates be paid at the local level rises as beer prices go up while the flat "per barrel" beer tax paid directly to the state remains stable. Hall, the brewmaster, said Tennessee’s taxes on beer mean Yazoo makes a higher profit off beer sold in other states, even factoring in shipping costs. Foge said that’s a big reason why many Tennesseans in the beer business find it "infuriating" when reports fail to include the wholesale beer tax when calculating Tennessee’s overall beer excise taxes. Our ruling The Tax Foundation published beer excise tax figures that included local taxes for other states, but excluded Tennessee and Kentucky’s wholesale beer taxes. While the map is accurate that Tennessee has a flat per-barrel beer excise tax of $0.14 per gallon, excluding the statewide wholesale beer tax creates a misleading impression that Tennessee’s beer taxes are among the lowest in the nation.

pomt-07156	Rick Perry "has never lost an election and remains the only person to have won the Texas governorship three times in landslide elections."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/14/ted-nugent/ted-nugent-says-rick-perry-first-governor-win-thri/	Describing current GOP presidential hopefuls as unexciting, Texas guitar artist and Motor City transplant Ted Nugent trumpets his friend Rick Perry’s pizzazz and undefeated streak at the polls. and In a June 1 op-ed column in The Washington Times, Nugent calls Perry a "powerful and popular" true conservative, saying: "He has never lost an election and remains the only person to have won the Texas governorship three times in landslide elections." Undefeated, sure. Perry has won every bid for office since his initial election to the Texas House, as a Democrat, in 1984. But we wondered if Perry is alone in winning the Texas governorship thrice, by landslides every time. Turns out, according to the Texas Almanac, Democrats Allan Shivers and John Connally each won three times for governor, back when governors served two-year terms. Shivers enjoyed three landslides, drubbing opponents in 1950 and 1954 and doing even better in 1952 when he was on the ballot as both the Democratic and Republican nominee. Shivers-the-Democrat got nearly 1.4 million votes while Shivers-the-Republican drew 468,000. Connally had landslide wins in 1964 and 1966, claiming a more narrow victory in 1962 with 54 percent of the vote to Republican Jack Cox’s nearly 46 percent. Perry, elected lieutenant governor in 1998, ascended to the governorship in December 2000 after then-Gov George W. Bush resigned to prepare for his first term as president. Perry won election as governor in 2002 and re-election in 2006 and 2010. According to results posted online by the Texas Secretary of State’s office, Perry romped to two of his gubernatorial wins. He carried 58 percent of the 2002 vote, with Democrat Tony Sanchez getting 40 percent, and drew 55 percent in 2010 to Democrat Bill White’s 42 percent. In 2006, Perry prevailed with just 39 percent of the vote. Among three major challengers, Democrat Chris Bell garnered 30 percent, Independent Carole Keeton Strayhorn got 18 percent and Independent Kinky Friedman landed with nearly 12.5 percent. Does this win rate as a landslide? Sure, advised Daron Shaw, a University of Texas government professor who also does polls for GOP candidates. Nope, countered Cal Jillson, a Southern Methodist University professor of political science. In an interview, Shaw said political scientists have made a cottage industry out of defining landslides, but he said the general rule is a landslide occurs if the victor bests their leading opponent by 10 percentage points or more. Shaw added that a calculation is in order when the field consists of more than two major candidates. In such cases, he said, he gauges how the winner fared compared to the second-place finisher. By this measure, Perry ended up with 56-plus percent of the 2006 votes cast for him or Bell, and Bell got 43-plus percent. Jillson told us that one marker of a landslide is beating your opponent by 10 percentage points or more of the votes, but he said such a win in the governor’s race also has to show strength among voters across the state. As noted Nov. 9, 2006 by Dallas Morning News columnist William McKenzie, Bell defeated Perry in Dallas, Travis and El Paso counties and lost by narrow margins in Harris and Bexar counties. Put another way, McKenzie wrote, among the six major urban counties, only Tarrant favored Perry by a significant margin. And, Jillson said, he would not term Perry’s ‘06 win a landslide. Indeed, he said, the governor’s 39 percent amounted to a comeuppance; 60 percent of voters chose a different aspirant. Our take: Perry is the third--not first--Texas governor to win re-election thrice. Two of his wins were bona fide landslides but the third’s landslide status is at least debatable.

pomt-07454	"[Appalachian Power] wants another 10 percent rate increase. The compensation package for CEO Mike Morris rose 22 percent to $8.7 million in 2010."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/19/ward-armstrong/ward-armstrong-says-appalachian-power-wants-10-per/	House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong has been fighting Appalachian Power Company for two years. Apco won the last round in January, when Republicans in the House of Delegates squashed two Armstrong bills aimed at returning Virginia to its old system of electric utility regulation. Energy lobbyists and the company, alongside Dominion Virginia Power, argued that most of Apco’s price increases in recent years would still have been permitted under the old system and that no change was needed. Armstrong’s latest salvo came March 31, the same day Apco announced it was seeking a series of rate increases in Virginia. He took to Twitter to vent his frustration. "Apco wants another 10% rate increase. The compensation package for CEO Mike Morris rose 22% to $8.7 million in 2010," Armstrong wrote. Armstrong has botched up the facts in past attacks on Apco, so we took a look at his latest claims. Apco announced in a March 31 press release it was seeking to raise rates by "about 10 percent" for 2012 through a series of rate filings. The actual increase, if granted in full by the State Corporation Commission, which oversees utility regulation in Virginia, would be 9.6 percent. Under the new rate, Apco says, customers would pay $104.99 per 1,000 kilowatt-hours. The company has discussed its proposed rate hikes with Armstrong and other politicians representing Apco customers. Del. Anne Crockett-Stark, R-Wytheville, told The Roanoke Times that she and other lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will oppose the company’s rate request when the SCC holds its hearings. Under Virginia’s utility regulations, companies can adjust the "base rate" they charge customers every two years. But they also can can also file separate "rate adjustment cases," or "RACs" at any time. RACs are designed to cover certain changes in costs, such as a sudden increase in fuel prices -- primarily coal in Apco’s case -- or changes in the cost of meeting environmental regulations. The company requested and received a hefty rate increase for environmental costs about two years ago. In January hearings on Armstrong’s bill, Apco executives said the money was needed to meet stricter air pollution mandates from the Environmental Protection Agency. The utility was adding new air "scrubbers" that reduced the amount of pollution, especially sulfur dioxide, released by its coal-fired plants. Apco customers complained that between the biennial base rate increases and RAC changes, they never knew what they would be charged month to month. The company said it has decided to bundle the base rate case and three RACs together this year to avoid that problem, with the aim of altering rates once and then leaving them in place for an extended period of time. In the current request, the firm wants to boost its base rate by about 6.3 percent, then tack on a 3.2 percent increase for environmental costs and a 0.5 percent increase to meet voluntary standards on renewable energy investments. After a slight decrease in generation rates, the requested increase comes to 9.6 percent. So Armstrong’s right about the size of Apco’s requested increase, but what about the CEO’s salary? First, we should note that Michael Morris is not the CEO of Apco, as Armstrong implies. Morris is the CEO of American Electric Power, Apco’s parent company. AEP serves about 5.3 million customers in 11 states, including Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The company operates through several different subsidiaries; Apco serves AEP’s customers in Virginia and West Virginia. Armstrong took the salary information from an article by The Associated Press, which reported that Morris received total compensation of $8.7 million in 2010. The AP said that was a 22 percent increase from 2009. The AP’s salary calculations are based on a company’s annual proxy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The calculation includes any salary, bonuses and perks, as well as the estimated value of stock options given to the executive in a given year. The AP does not include the change in value of an executive’s pension. That figure is usually included in an executive’s reported salary. According to AEP’s 2010 proxy, Morris was paid $9 million in 2010, up from $7.5 million in 2009. That’s an increase of 20 percent. Morris made $10 million in 2008. AEP does not disclose the salary for Charles Patton, Apco’s CEO. Let’s review our findings. Armstrong’s right that Apco has requested a roughly 10 percent rate increase. The actual request is for a 9.6 percent jump, but even the utility said "about 10 percent" in its press release. Readers could easily conclude from his message that Mike Morris is Apco’s CEO. That’s not the case; Morris is actually CEO of American Electric Power, Apco’s parent company. But Armstrong does cite Morris’s 2010 salary, and the increase from 2009, accurately. The salary figures for Apco CEO Charles Patton are not available. We rate this statement True.	None	Ward Armstrong	None	None	None	2011-04-19T10:59:42	2011-03-31	['None']

pomt-07046	"Creeping defense commitments in (the Middle East) and globally now consume over half the U.S. discretionary budget annually."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/01/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-says-defense-spending-consumes-mo/	Members of Congress peeved with the decision to involve the United States in Libya took to the House of Representatives floor on June 24 to voice their objections. Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur was among them. Irked by the cost of U.S. involvement in the Middle East, she opined that the U.S. bears a disproportionate burden during joint actions with other countries, and tied the nation’s debt to "expenditures of over $1 trillion in the past decade on wars that have not been paid for." "Creeping defense commitments in that region and globally now consume over half of the U.S. discretionary budget annually," Kaptur said. "It is an astounding predicament 20 years after the end of the Cold War, as jobless Americans question whether our federal government even sees their plight." Is it true, as Kaptur says, that the United States’ global defense commitments "now consume over half the U.S. discretionary budget annually?" PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. Kaptur, a member of the House of Representatives Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, referred us to reports produced by the National Priorities Project, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Congressional Research Servicewhen we contacted her office. They explain that the federal budget is divided into two types of spending: discretionary and mandatory. Mandatory spending makes up most of the federal budget. It’s called "mandatory" because it’s required by law. Disbursements on popular entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and food stamps fall under this category. Spending levels for mandatory programs are generally controlled by eligibility criteria for the entitlements, and the size of the recipient pool. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the mandatory share of the federal budget was $1.969 trillion in 2010. The rest of the federal budget is considered "discretionary." Congress decides how this money is spent through the appropriations process. Defense programs as well as education, health, transportation and housing assistance programs are considered discretionary. According to the Congressional Budget Office, discretionary defense spending was $689 billion in 2010, compared with $677 billion in non-defense expenditures. That’s more than half. The Congressional Research Service says discretionary defense spending dropped to historically low levels after the fall of the Berlin Wall, but escalated again when the United States went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Between 2000 and 2010, CRS says discretionary defense spending increased 6.8 percent per year, on average, in real terms. Others can debate the merits or faults of ballooning defense spending. Kaptur’s statement is accurate and there’s nothing signifcant missing. On the Truth-O-Meter it rates as True.

pomt-03902	Virginia is "the only state" that has a tradition of attorneys general resigning if they run for governor.	true	/virginia/statements/2013/mar/01/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-virginia-only-state-where-attorney/	Ken Cuccinelli is ending a recent tradition of Virginia attorneys general resigning from office when they run for governor, causing an early stir this election year. During a Jan. 29 radio interview, Cuccinelli said he told voters in 2009 that he would serve out his four-year term as attorney general and that he intends to keep that commitment. "I ran for attorney general to be attorney general," he said. Cuccinelli, who is unopposed for the Republican gubernatorial nomination this spring, was confident he could handle the dual responsibilities of being the state’s chief lawyer and a candidate. He was dismissive of Virginia’s custom of attorneys general stepping down to run for higher office. "We’re the only state in the country that has this attorney general resign background," he said. No doubt, Democrats hope to make an issue of Cuccinelli’s decision to stay in office. A dozen Democratic legislators sent a well-publicized letter to the attorney general last month asking him to follow the tradition of resigning. And American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal Super PAC, has released two web videos labeling Cuccinelli a "part-time" attorney general. "For nearly three decades, attorneys general who ran for governor from both parties have all resigned to campaign," the group notes. We decided to check whether the custom really is unique to Virginia. The tradition actually began on Aug. 28, 1957, according to our search of the archives at the Richmond Times-Dispatch. That’s when Democrat Lindsay Almond Jr. announced he would step down as attorney general to focus on that fall’s gubernatorial race. "It is apparent to me that the political campaign soon to be actively launched will consume my full time and energy, necessitating extended absence from and consequently inattention to the important responsibilities of the office which has been entrusted to me by the people of Virginia," Almond wrote in a letter to then-Gov. Thomas Stanley. Almond won the election that year. And in 1961, he accepted the resignation of Democrat Albertis Harrison, another attorney general who became governor. Sixteen years passed before another attorney general would be nominated for governor -- Democrat Andrew Miller. He resigned as the state’s lawyer in January 1977, well before the heavy campaigning began. Miller lost the gubernatorial race to Republican John Dalton. The tradition was temporarily broken in 1981 by Republican Marshall Coleman who, instead of resigning as attorney general, announced that April that he would accept only half of his $45,000 salary while he ran for governor. Coleman lost to Democrat Chuck Robb. Since then, six straight attorneys general resigned to run for governor: Jerry Baliles in 1985; Mary Sue Terry in 1993; Jim Gilmore in 1997; Mark Earley in 2001; Jerry Kilgore in 2005 and Bob McDonnell in 2009. Each essentially said that an attorney general needs to devote full attention to the the job. We asked Cuccinelli’s campaign for proof of the candidate’s claim that Virginia is "the only state" with the resignation tradition. Spokesman Jay Wilcox offered nothing concrete. He sent a scattershot list of four attorneys general from other states who, over the years, did not resign to run for governor and three more who did not step down when they ran for the U.S. Senate. We sought more conclusive information, calling the National Association of Attorneys General, the Democratic Attorneys General Association, the Republican Attorneys General Association and the National Governors Association. Each organization said it doesn’t keep records of whether state attorneys general across the nation resigned when they ran for governor. Most of the groups declined additional comment. Only Travis Berry, executive director of Democratic Attorneys General Association, was willing weigh in. "It seems to be a Virginia-specific tradition," he said. Finally, we decided to research every gubernatorial race in the country since 1985 -- the year Baliles started the string of six straight Virginia attorneys general resigning to run for governor. During the course of this, we came across some information from a few earlier elections. All told, we found 31 states outside Virginia where an attorney general ran for governor, and not a single one of them resigned. The attorneys general who stayed on were from both parties. Some became household names: Bill Clinton of Arkansas in 1979; Jerry Brown of California in 2010, Eliot Spitzer of New York in 2006 and John Ashcroft of Missouri in 1984. Here’s the list of no-resign states and the year of the gubernatorial election: * Alabama, 1958 * Arizona, 2002, 2006 * Arkansas 1978, 2006 * California, 1982, 2010 * Delaware, 1964 * Florida, 2006. * Idaho, 1994. * Illinois, 1990, 2002 * Indiana, 1992 * Iowa, 1994 * Kansas, 1960 * Kentucky, 2003 * Maine, 1978, 1986 * Massachusetts, 1998 * Minnesota, 1998, 2006 * Michigan, 2002 * Mississippi, 1983 * Missouri, 1984, 1992, 2012 * Montana, 1992, 2012 * Nevada, 1978 * New York, 2006, 2010 * North Carolina, 2000 * North Dakota, 1992, 2000 * Ohio, 1990 * Oregon, 1990 * Pennsylvania, 2002, 2010 * South Dakota, 1978 * Texas, 1982 * Washington, 2004, 2012 * West Virginia, 1960 * Wisconsin, 2002. Finally, we should note that 43 states popularly elect their chief lawyer, according to the National Association of Attorneys General. In five states, governors appoint the attorney general: Alaska, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Wyoming. In Maine, the attorney general is elected by the legislature. In Tennessee, the office holder is appointed by the state Supreme Court. Our ruling Cuccinelli said Virginia is "the only state" that has a tradition of attorneys general resigning if they run for governor. There’s no doubt that the custom exists in Virginia. The last six attorneys general have resigned to run for governor, dating back to 1985. Cuccinelli plans to break that string this year. No one, it seems, keeps data on whether the custom exists in other states. So we researched every gubernatorial election in the U.S. since 1985 and, along, the way, ran across information from a few earlier elections. All told, we found 31 states outside Virginia where attorneys general ran for governor. None of the candidates resigned. We rate Cuccinelli’s statement True.

pomt-14231	The Republicans "still want to privatize (Social Security). In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/15/hillary-clinton/clinton-exaggerates-republicans-plan-privatize-soc/	During the Brooklyn presidential debate, Hillary Clinton positioned herself as a defender of Social Security while also blasting Wall Street. The Republicans, Clinton said, "still want to privatize (Social Security). In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street." However, this is exaggerated. It falls into a long tradition of politicians, including many Democrats, raising alarms over Republican plans for Social Security. As we noted more than two years ago, Republicans have long pushed -- unsuccessfully -- for adding an element of private investment to Social Security. Proponents usually call these "personal accounts," while critics call it "privatization." Whatever term you use, none of the remaining three GOP presidential candidates has said the United States should "turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street." A primer on privatization Social Security benefits for today’s recipients come from the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by younger and middle-aged workers. But over the years, some conservatives have pushed for turning Social Security into a system where workers invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement. The upside, supporters argue, is retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given that historical rates of return from private investments are higher than those for Social Security. The downside is the possibility of market losses. Even though Social Security funds would likely be invested more conservatively than many private investments, doing so would still carry risk that beneficiaries could lose value or, in a worst-case scenario, see their savings wiped out entirely. Neither outcome is possible under the current Social Security program. The most high-profile proposal along these lines came in 2005, when President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into "personal retirement accounts." Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam, and it died without even being introduced as legislation. A few years after that, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- who would in 2012 become the running mate for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and now serves as House speaker -- offered a similar proposal, allowing workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government. This idea also went nowhere in Congress. These two failures reinforced the longstanding conventional wisdom that changing the way Social Security operates is the "third rail" of politics (that is, touch it and you die). This opposition to change is particularly strong among older voters, who are both reliant on Social Security and who tend to vote at higher-than-average rates. For this reason, Social Security-themed attack ads have been prevalent over the years, often aired by Democrats, though sometimes by Republicans. Attacks against plans such as Bush’s and Ryan’s have often played up the term "privatization" as a scary concept -- so much so that supporters of this type of proposal have taken pains to distance their plans from that terminology. What the Republican candidates say When we contacted the Clinton campaign, they sent three examples, one for each of the remaining GOP hopefuls. For Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the Clinton campaign pointed to a remark by Cruz in the fourth Republican primary debate on Nov. 11, 2015. Cruz said, "What I’ve said is for seniors, we should make no changes whatsoever. For younger workers, we should gradually raise the retirement age. We should have benefits grow more slowly, and we should allow them to keep a portion of their taxes in a personal account that they control, and can pass on to their kids." This makes pretty clear that Cruz is offering an idea much like Bush’s 2005 proposal. It involves a portion of taxes, and it doesn’t simply hand over money to Wall Street but rather has individuals make their own decisions about how to invest it. A rundown of Cruz statements related to Social Security collected by AARP, an advocacy group for senior citizens, produces several other statements by Cruz that echo this general approach. This is notably different than what’s communicated by Clinton’s charge -- that Cruz would "turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street." For Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the Clinton campaign pointed us to a statement in the Chicago Tribune -- from 16 years ago. The article said that Kasich, then a U.S. House member, "has introduced a plan similar to" the one for Social Security that Bush, then a candidate, was advocating. It involved Americans putting "perhaps 2 percentage points of their Social Security payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts for investment in stocks and bonds," according to the article. But that wasn’t in line with what Clinton charged in the debate, and today, Kasich doesn’t even cite personal accounts as part of his proposal for addressing Social Security. According to his campaign’s website, "John Kasich’s balanced budget framework does not include changes to Social Security or its benefits to achieve balance, nor does it include the costs of filling Social Security’s deficits. As president he will lead a bipartisan effort to assemble the best ideas from the various reform plans that have been proposed to preserve its solvency." The Clinton campaign also reached back 16 years to find evidence on the other GOP candidate, Donald Trump. It pointed to his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, in which Trump proposed allowing "every American to dedicate some portion of their payroll taxes to a personal Social Security account that they could own and invest in stocks and bonds. Federal guidelines could make sure that your money is diversified, that it is invested in sound mutual funds or bond funds, and not in emu ranches." Here, too, Trump’s plan from 2000 was more nuanced than Clinton’s comment would indicate -- and more to the point, Trump appears to have said nothing about returning to the personal account idea. He does not mention Social Security among the policy issues he addresses on his website, and the AARP’s collection of Trump quotes on Social Security doesn’t provide any indication that he favors privatization now. Finally, it’s worth noting that the partial privatization plans have typically been limited to younger workers -- not those who have reached or are approaching retirement age. Our ruling Clinton said Republicans "still want to privatize (Social Security). In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street." At least one candidate, Cruz, has proposed a form of privatization involving personal accounts funded by a fraction of payroll taxes. Still, Clinton’s statement takes a longstanding Democratic exaggeration about the scope of GOP overhaul proposals and makes it even further off-base by implying that payroll tax revenues would flow directly to Wall Street without any input from beneficiaries.

pomt-04551	Says Measures 82 and 83 authorize just one more casino.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/27/yes-82-and-83-campaign/do-measures-82-and-83-authorize-just-one-new-casin/	In their campaign ad, "Different," proponents of a new casino in Wood Village assure viewers that their proposal would not lead to a proliferation of gambling complexes in Oregon. "There are nine casinos in Oregon today," the speaker says with words on screen to that effect. Ballot measures "82 and 83 authorize just one more. The Grange in Wood Village." The Grange is a proposed $300 million entertainment complex at the old greyhound racing track in east Multnomah County. We wanted to know if the claim was accurate. First of all, why are there two ballot measures? Let’s work backward, with the simpler measure first. Measure 83 sets the statutory parameters for the casino in Wood Village, including authority for up to 3,500 slot machines. This goes nowhere if Measure 82 is not approved. Why? Because Oregon has a constitutional ban on any casinos not run by tribes. Measure 82 would delete that language to allow the Oregon Lottery to permit "a taxpaying casino" -- i.e. a nontribal casino -- only if certain conditions are met: Voters authorize the casino by initiative petition. This is what these casino backers did, paying for circulators to collect enough signatures to put the measure on the ballot. Now voters statewide get to vote. The casino will be in an incorporated city, with residents in that city voting to approve the casino. Wood Village will vote on a local measure Nov. 6. The casino will be owned and operated by a corporation incorporated in Oregon. PDX Entertainment Company incorporated in March, according to the secretary of state’s office. The casino will not be within a 60-mile radius of a tribal casino operating on reservation land in Oregon as of January 2011. The Wood Village casino would be 75 miles away from the Grand Ronde’s Spirit Mountain Casino and 90 miles from the Warm Springs’ Indian Head Casino. And finally, the casino will pay 25 percent of adjusted gross revenue to the state for public schools. This casino proposes to do just that. Those are very specific criteria for a new casino in Oregon. Still, 82 does not put a limit on the number of new private casinos allowed, unlike in 2010 when the same investors tried to change the constitution to allow only their casino. This time, if investors want to open a casino in, say Cascade Locks, they could, provided they go through another round of statewide and local elections. (And just so you know, in 2010, the measure changing the Constitution to allow one casino never made it to the ballot. The companion measure authorizing the Wood Village casino in statute did make it on the ballot and was defeated, two-to-one.) Stacey Dycus, spokeswoman for the Yes on 82 and 83 campaign, said they’re not trying to hide the ball. The ad, she said, was largely in response to remarks by people opposed to the Wood Village casino, including Justin Martin, a lobbyist for the Grand Ronde tribe, which runs the very successful Spirit Mountain Casino. "Once you knock out the barrier of the Constitution, what's to prevent the Legislature, or the next wealthy executive, from putting one between Salem and Eugene?" he told The Oregonian last month. (Well, as we spelled out above, lawmakers can’t put one on the ballot, Salem is too close to Spirit Mountain Casino; a spot somewhere south of Salem and north of Eugene may qualify for a casino, if backers go through the steps outlined above.) "We thought that was creating confusion and that people thought that there might be a misconception," Dycus said. "We’re attempting to run a very fact-driven campaign, to give Oregonians all the information they need to make a choice. And after 83 and 82 pass, there will be just a 10th casino." (In response to Dycus’s response, the spokeswoman for the other side said "the larger issue at stake is whether or not Oregonians want to fundamentally change how gambling is managed in Oregon and allow for multiple private-casinos around the state." Fair enough all around.) But PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t care so much about the campaign insiders. We care about the casual viewer who comes across the ad and asks: Would this create just one new casino? To that, we say, yes, it would create one new casino. But we’d be remiss if we didn’t tell the viewer that one of the two ballot measures changes the constitution to allow the possibility of more in the future. That detail is important. The Constitution has been amended numerous times, but it’s still the Constitution. We rate the statement Half True -- partially accurate, missing an important detail -- and reserve the right to fact check Martin’s statement in the future.

pomt-08440	Says more Republicans than Democrats voted for the Wall Street bailouts.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/18/kurt-schrader/kurt-schrader-says-more-republicans-democrats-vote/	The Wall Street bailout (or the Troubled Asset Relief Program, as pols would have us refer to it) is right up there with the stimulus and health care reform in terms of fodder for attack ads this year. Never mind that the bailout was, in fact, proposed and passed before the current Congress, during the very end of the George W. Bush presidency, or that it appears it will be much less expensive than originally expected. Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader tried to put the program in its proper historical context during a radio appearance on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s Think Out Loud this week. (It should be noted that neither Schrader nor his Republican challenger, Scott Bruun, was a member of Congress when it passed the bailout.) Let’s see what he had to say on OPB, while he and Bruun were debating fiscal policy: Schrader: George Bush and the Republican administration is the guys that did the big bank bailout. Do you want to reinstall those people to power? I'm sorry. And Scott's against the Wall Street reforms. Bruun: Congressman, remind me when your speaker came into power as the speaker? Remind me what year that was. Was that 2009? No. That was 2007. Schrader: Yeah, but the policies came directly out of the Republican administration. I mean -- and more Republicans voted for that than Democrats. That last bit stopped us. More Republicans than Democrats voted for the bailout? That would be ironic, given its widespread use as an attack against Democrats these days. PolitiFact Oregon went straight to the voting records to check this claim. As it turns out, the House actually had to vote twice for the particular bill in which TARP was included. The first vote was on Sept. 29, 2008. The legislation failed to move, though, with 205 representatives voting in favor and 228 against. Of those who voted for the the passage, 140 were Democrats and 65 were Republicans. A few days later, with the economy worsening, the bill got a second life when Senate members took a completely unrelated piece of legislation that hadn’t much moved anywhere for months and stuffed it with the bailout language. The new bill passed the Senate on Oct. 1, 2008. On that day, 39 Democrats, 34 Republicans and one Independent voted in favor of the legislation. So, Schrader is wrong there. The House then voted on the TARP language -- for the second time -- two days after the Senate, on Oct. 3, 2008. Ninety-one Republicans joined 172 Democrats in voting for the bill. Again, Schrader is wrong on this vote. There’s not much use arguing with official numbers. Schrader’s right on this: The Wall Street bailout -- one of this election year’s go-to boogeymen -- was, at least in part, the product of the Bush administration. But, he’s definitely wrong when it comes to counting votes: 86 more Democrats than Republicans voted in favor of the program’s ultimate passage. A spokesman for the campaign now says Schrader simply misspoke. PolitiFact Oregon rates this statement False. Comment on this item.

pomt-11286	"We’ve spent more money on the military than the next 12 nations combined."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/apr/24/bernie-sanders/sanders-says-us-military-spending-bigger-next-12-n/	A "moral economy" means spending more on things like health care and education and less on the military, according to Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders, a Vermont independent and Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, shared a stage with the Rev. William Barber II at Duke University in Durham on April 19 to talk about systemic inequality during their event to honor Martin Luther King Jr. To drive home his point about U.S. defense spending, Sanders said, "We’ve spent more money on the military than the next 12 nations combined." "That," Sanders added, "you will never hear in the media." Be careful what you ask for, Senator. A familiar claim PolitiFact has checked claims about military spending before. And if Sanders’ claim sounds familiar, that may be because President Barack Obama made a similar claim during his 2016 State of the Union address. "We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined," Obama said. It’s been two years since we rated Obama’s claim Mostly True on our Truth-O-Meter. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com At the time, PolitiFact relied on the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a think tank, for information to rate Obama’s claim. By that group’s calculation, the United States in 2014 — the most recent year available at the time — spent more than the next seven countries combined. Updated SIPRI numbers show that the United States spent $611 billion in 2016, more than eight other countries combined — but not 12. The institute hasn’t released numbers for 2017. So does that mean Sanders is exaggerating? A year late Sanders’ office, upon being contacted by PolitiFact, cited as his source a 2016 report by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. The 2016 report shows that the United States spent about $604.5 billion on its military, which indeed is higher than the next 12 countries combined. China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, France, Germany, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and Italy spent a combined $601 billion in 2016. However, the most recent IISS report shows the U.S. spending is ahead of the next 10 countries. The United States spent $602.8 billion, while the next 10 countries spent a combined $593 billion. The change in ratio has more to do with foreign countries than it does with the U.S. military budget. While U.S. spending dipped slightly, Saudi Arabia boosted spending by nearly $20 billion. China and Brazil increased spending by about $5 billion apiece. PolitiFact alerted Sanders’ office to the updated IISS numbers. "We will update our talking points," Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis said. Our ruling Sanders said the U.S. government has spent "more money on the military than the next 12 nations combined." He cited a 2016 chart that supported his claim, but it has been updated recently to a new pecking order of military spending. Still, Sanders’ claim is in the ballpark. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-11301	Says that despite a recent increase in school funding, Scott Walker "has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/20/tony-evers/did-scott-walker-take-1-billion-wisconsin-schools-/	Since shortly after Republican Scott Walker became governor in 2011, Democrats have claimed that he cut $1 billion or more in state funding for public schools. Now, with Walker seeking a third term, the billion-dollar attacks are back. One was made by Tony Evers, who, as state schools superintendent, would seem to be in a good position to know. Evers is one of a slew of Democrats hoping to win the August 2018 primary election in order to challenge Walker in November. Evers was asked in a March 23, 2018, Wausau radio interview about a recent increase in funding Walker had approved for kindergarten through 12th grade schools. Evers replied by saying: In K through 12, I think it’s a one-year flash. Governor Walker has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools and it hasn’t been replaced. This year, a little bit of an anomaly …. Some of the other Democratic candidates for governor, including Mahlon Mitchell and Kelda Helen Roys, have made similar attacks. There’s no question that, despite recent funding increases, Walker earlier made significant cuts to school funding. But has Walker "taken" over $1 billion from public schools? Not in the way most people would think of a funding cut. Evers’ evidence To back Evers’ statement, his campaign provided calculations of "total educational cost" figures. They indicate school funding is down a total of more than $1 billion since 2010-’11 -- the final state fiscal year under Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle. But those figures count federal, state and local sources of school funding. So, let’s go to a more direct measure -- state money allocated in the state budget for K-12 schools. State funding of schools When we posed Evers’ claim to the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the bureau provided us these GPR (general purpose revenue) figures. They include funding streams known as per-pupil aid, equalization aid and other categorical aids. The chart below contains a lot of numbers. But we’ll focus on only four figures, each marked with an asterisk, and we’ll walk you through them. State fiscal year GPR school aids Change to prior year Change to 2010-’11 Cumulative change to 2010-’11 2010-’11 $5.27 billion* 2011-’12 $4.85 billion -$426.5 million* -$426.5 million -$426.5 million 2012-’13 $4.91 billion +$68.9 million -$357.6 million -$784.1 million 2013-’14 $5.03 billion +$119.8 million -$237.8 million -$1.021 billion 2014-’15 $5.19 billion +$160.5 million -$77.3 million -$1.1 billion 2015-’16 $5.2 billion +$3 million -$74.3 million -$1.17 billion* 2016-’17 $5.4 billion +$197.3 million +$123 million -$1.05 billion 2017-’18 $5.58 billion +$176.9 million +$299.9 million -$750.6 million 2018-’19 $5.84 billion +$267.1 million +$567 million -$183.6 million* The starting point is $5.27 billion -- the amount of state funding for schools in 2010-’11, Doyle’s last year as governor. Think of that as the base. The next year, 2011-’12, Walker used his first state budget to cut school funding by $426.5 million, the second figure with an asterisk -- that’s the actual reduction. How to get to ‘over $1 billion’ Since making that cut, Walker has increased the amount of state aid to schools every year. But it took awhile before state aid got back to the level it was under Doyle’s final year. More specifically, in Walker’s first five years, schools received a total of $1.17 billion less in state aid than if the funding had remained at the base level. But if you carry that comparison forward to today, the amount "taken" is only $183.6 million. Other factors A final point. While it’s clear that Walker’s first budget cut the $426.5 million, he also gave school districts the "tools," with Act 10, to recoup their losses. The law, which dramatically reduced collective bargaining power for teachers and most public employees in Wisconsin, enabled school districts to save money by, for example, requiring employees to pay for a greater share of their health insurance. On the other hand, Walker also reduced how much money revenue school districts could raise in property taxes. And that reduction, like the state funding for schools overall, hasn’t been fully restored -- though school districts can ask voters in referendums to exceed the limits. Our rating Evers says that despite a recent increase in school funding, Walker "has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools." In Walker’s first year as governor, he cut school aid by $426.5 million from the previous year, Doyle’s final year as governor. Because it took five years to get school funding back to that base level, it can be argued that Walker "took" a total of $1.17 billion from schools over that period. But since then, Walker has increased school funding to the point that the deficit, in comparison to the base year, is $183.6 million. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tony Evers	None	None	None	2018-04-20T06:00:00	2018-03-23	['None']

pomt-14273	Says Hillary Clinton "has been saying lately that she thinks that I am, 'not qualified to be president.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/07/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-not-qualified-be-president-hillary-/	Presidential candidates spend a lot of time explaining why they are the best qualified for the job. But now a brouhaha has broken out between Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders over whether the other is qualified at all. During an April 6 rally at Temple University in Philadelphia, Sanders contended that in the wake of Clinton's loss in Wisconsin, she is getting a little nervous. "And she has been saying lately that she thinks that I am, 'not qualified to be president,’ " he told the crowd. Sanders then said, "I don't believe that she is qualified if she is, through her super PAC, taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds. I don't think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your Super PAC. I don't think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq. I don't think you are qualified if you've supported virtually every disastrous trade agreement, which has cost us millions of decent-paying jobs." In fact, both candidates are clearly qualified in the strictest sense, because they both meet the four constitutional requirements to be president: age 35 or older, a natural born citizen, a resident for at least 14 years, and neither are finishing a second term in the job. So is Sanders correct that Clinton has been saying the he was "not qualified to be president"? We emailed his campaign asking where to find Clinton specifically and directly making that statement. The campaign couldn't. Instead, the Sanders people sent us video of a Sanders news conference in which he cites a CNN report saying that the Clinton campaign's strategy would be to "Disqualify (Sanders), defeat him and unify the party later." But that's not a quote from Clinton. It's a summation by CNN's senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny, who begins his article this way: "Hillary Clinton's campaign is taking new steps to try and disqualify Bernie Sanders in the eyes of Democratic voters." The article says Clinton spokeswoman Christina Reynolds argued that Sanders is unqualified, but Reynolds is not directly quoted as saying that. Instead, she is quoted as saying, "You get the impression Sen. Sanders hasn't thought very much" about how to actually get goals accomplished. Sanders also cited a April 6 Washington Post headline: "Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president." That headline comes from a story based on an April 6 interview with Clinton on the MSNBC show Morning Joe, in which host Joe Scarborough repeatedly tried to get Clinton to say whether she believed Sanders is "qualified and ready" to be president. In each case, Clinton wouldn't answer directly. Initially, Clinton said Sanders' interview with the New York Daily News "raised a lot of really serious questions." In the interview, Sanders seemed to stumble over details about how he would implement some of his proposals, such as breaking up big banks. "So is he qualified?" Scarborough said, asking if she thought Sanders was "ready to be president." Clinton said she thought Sanders hadn't done his homework and "that does raise a lot of questions." Scarborough tried again, asking "But do you think he is qualified?" Again, Clinton didn't give a yes or no answer. The lead paragraph on the Washington Post story: "Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton on Wednesday questioned whether her rival in the Democratic presidential primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), is qualified to be president." But Clinton saying that Sanders' answers raise questions about his qualifications is very different from saying he's "not qualified." Our ruling Sanders said Clinton "has been saying lately that she thinks that I am 'not qualified to be president.' " That's the spin some media outlets are putting on it, when Clinton dodged the question of whether or not she thinks Sanders is qualified. But she's never directly said it, as Sanders specifically alleged. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c946cee5-8369-47de-b43b-3945940259be	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-07T16:05:34	2016-04-06	['None']
pomt-03735	"Within the three miles surrounding the University Circle area, infant mortality exceeds some Third World countries."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/12/michele-walsh/expert-says-infant-mortality-rate-near-university-/	Public health experts consider the infant mortality rate an important indicator of a community's well-being. It is one of the factors that helped land Cuyahoga County in the bottom third of Ohio counties in overall health in a national study released last month by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Cuyahoga, with its major health centers, performed well again on access to primary care in the annual study. But major health centers can't compensate for poverty and the other, often related stressors that contribute to the high infant mortality of Northeast Ohio. Ohio's rate of infant mortality -- 7.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in the first year of life -- is 11th-worst in the nation, said a public radio report on the subject on WCPN's "Sound of Ideas." The most recent rate reported for Cuyahoga County was a dismal 9.1 deaths, according to the Ohio Department of Health, and the average from 2006 to 2010 was 9.7. Among the experts who discussed the subject on WCPN was Dr. Michele Walsh, division chief of neonatology at Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital. "Within the three miles surrounding the University Circle area, infant mortality exceeds some Third World countries," she said, "and that is an embarrassment and cannot be allowed to continue." PolitiFact Ohio agreed that the rate would be alarming. We wanted to know more. We called Dr. Walsh, who said her statement about the city reflects data from a study conducted by researchers at Case Western Reserve University Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences. Its extensive research database is called NEO CANDO, for Northeast Ohio Community and Neighborhood Data for Organizing. It draws from a wide variety of sources that include the U.S. Census and the Ohio Department of Health, and it can break down information by neighborhood. For worldwide rates of infant mortality, we checked the authoritative CIA "World Factbook." The term "Third World," which once designated countries not aligned politically with the West or the Communist bloc East, generally refers to underdeveloped and developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Many poorer nations use the term to describe themselves. For our fact-check, we used the listings of Third World countries, as measured by poverty and low human development, from the Nations Online independent reference portal. To stay within three miles of University Circle, we looked at data for neighborhoods on Cleveland's East Side. We found that two neighborhoods, Hough and Mount Pleasant, had infant mortality rates above 27 per 1,000 -- worse than in North Korea, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Samoa, Maldives or the Gaza Strip. Two other neighborhoods -- Kinsman (with an infant mortality rate of 31 per 1,000) and South Collinwood (29) -- had infant mortality worse than was reported in Zimbabwe. Infant mortality in the University Circle neighborhood, according to the NEO CANDO database, was slightly above 69 deaths per 1,000 live births. That exceeds the rate in countries that include, among others, Bangladesh, Haiti, Burma, Cameroon, Djibouti, Sudan, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Rwanda and Uganda. That number struck us as both anomalous and staggering. We looked for an explanation and got one from researcher Richard Stacklin of the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. The rate for University Circle, he said, reflected the neighborhood’s small statistical base in 2009 of 43 births and 3 infant deaths. He said its most recent three-year average -- a preferable statistic for the neighborhood because it better accounts for fluctuations -- is 18.6 deaths, a figure he noted is still unacceptable and almost double the countywide rate. The average rate worldwide, according to the "World Factbook," is 39.4 per 1,000. The book estimates infant mortality in the United States in 2012 as 6 deaths per 1,000 births -- worse than the average for nations of the European Union and worse than countries including Australia, South Korea and Cuba. Its figures show that some Third World nations have infant mortality rates that are exceeded by those for some neighborhoods within three miles of University Circle. Walsh’s statement rates as True.

pomt-00049	"Barron Trump was born in March 2006 and Melania wasn’t a legal citizen until July 2006. So under this executive order, his own son wouldn’t be an American citizen."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/04/blog-posting/would-trumps-own-son-be-affected-order-eliminating/	President Donald Trump recently revealed plans to sign an executive order that would end birthright citizenship for babies born in the United States to parents who aren’t citizens. Does that put his own son at risk? "Fun fact," starts a post that appeared on Facebook on Nov. 1. "Barron Trump was born in March 2006 and Melania wasn’t a legal citizen until July 2006. So under this executive order, his own son wouldn’t be an American citizen." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s start with Trump’s youngest child. Barron, who turned 12 on March 20, was indeed born in March 2006. His mother, Trump’s wife, Melania, is from Slovenia. She was working in New York as a model and dating Trump when she applied for a visa in 2000, according to the BBC. She secured a green card when her application was approved the following year. On March 20, 2006, she gave birth to Barron in New York and she became a U.S. citizen four months later in July 2006. The news about Trump targeting birthright citizenship was reported by Axios, which is airing an exclusive interview with the president today, Nov. 4. A story including excerpts of that conversation was published on Axios’ website on Oct. 30, and while the article discusses when Trump has the power to use an executive order, it doesn’t explain what, exactly, such an order would say in this case. On the campaign trail in 2015, Trump pitched a plan to end birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants. But we don’t yet know the details of a potential executive order to end birthright citizenship, including whether it would apply to children with one parent who is a citizen and another who isn’t. The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the state wherein they reside." The amendment was ratified in 1868 and was intended to extend citizenship to former slaves who’d been recently freed following the Civil War. The amendment goes on to forbid states from denying anyone "life, liberty or property, without due process of law" or to "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." Barron Trump, who was born on U.S. soil, is a citizen of the United States both because of the 14th Amendment and regardless of it: Had he been born abroad, he would still be considered a citizen. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has a policy that a child born outside of the United States becomes a citizen at birth if at that time one parent is a foreign national and the other is a U.S. citizen who has been physically present in the country for at least five years, including at least two years after that person turned 14. Legal scholars and Trump critics have questioned whether Trump has unilateral authority to make an executive order that would be in direct contrast with the 14th Amendment. Wrote Corey Brettschneider, a professor of political science at Brown University, in a Nov. 3 piece for The Guardian, "An executive order cannot reverse the guarantee of citizenship to anyone born in the United States that is enshrined in the constitution…Contrary to Trump’s assertion, the constitution’s text and values and Supreme Court decisions show he cannot unilaterally revoke birthright citizenship. Nor can Congress pass a law to do so. The idea is enshrined in the constitution and can only be changed with a formal amendment." In order for a constitutional amendment to be approved, it must be proposed by a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate. It would then need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states. Vice President Mike Pence stated in an Oct. 30 interview with Slate that Trump is looking at citizenship law broadly and suggested that the matter might need to go before the nation’s highest court: "We all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether or not the language of the 14th Amendment subject to the jurisdiction thereof applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally," Pence said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, meanwhile, has dismissed the idea that Trump could end birthright citizenship with an executive order: "I’m a believer in following the plain text of the constitution, and I think in this case the 14th Amendment is pretty clear," Ryan said on Oct. 30, "and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process." Our ruling A Facebook post says that "under an executive order" by President Trump to revoke birthright citizenship, Trump’s son Barron "wouldn’t be an American citizen." We don’t yet know either the details, scope or effect of the executive order Trump is planning. But we do know that the 14th Amendment guarantees Barron Trump citizenship. And we do know that even if Barron Trump had been born elsewhere, he would be a U.S. citizen because his father is a U.S. citizen who had been physically present in the U.S. for five years prior to Barron’s birth. Scholars suggest that it would take far more than an executive order to undo birthright citizenship. It is likely that any executive order that attempts to do so would encounter legal challenges. As PolitiFact’s own reporter Louis Jacobson wrote on Oct. 30, "The most that Trump could do is sign such an executive order with the clear expectation that opponents would sue to block its implementation. After that, it would be up to the courts to decide the ultimate outcome." We rate this claim False.

pomt-05058	The federal government has made investments in science and technology inventing the products that led to the creation of Google.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/09/barack-obama/obamas-google-claim/	So what role did the federal government have in helping Google blast off in cyberspace? PolitiFact Georgia did (what else?) a Google search to find out. Our inquiry was sparked by comments President Barack Obama made during a recent speech in Atlanta. The president was making the argument that smart government investments have been good for America -- pointing to well-known projects such as the Golden Gate Bridge and the development of the nation’s interstate highway system in the 1950s. "Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, said it pretty well," Obama said. "He said we should do for ourselves what we do best for ourselves, but we should also do together those things that we do better together. And so we made investments in science and technology, inventing the products that led to the Internet and GPS and Google and amazing medical breakthroughs. We did that because together, through our government, we made these investments in basic research." Maybe Al Gore created the Internet after all. Or not. PolitiFact Georgia hadn’t heard this claim about Google before and was very curious to learn whether Obama was correct. Obama has pushed Congress to support his plan to spend more federal dollars on infrastructure projects he believes will boost the nation’s economy. He also wants to spend more on research and development projects. The administration’s budget calls for a 5 percent increase, to $7.4 billion, in funding for the National Science Foundation. The funding would focus on research in advanced manufacturing, clean energy, wireless communications, and science and mathematics education. An Obama campaign spokeswoman referred us to some other information we found online to back up the president’s claim. The information comes from the NSF. In the mid-1990s, Stanford University students Larry Page and Sergey Brin began working on research to produce better ways to rank Internet search results. At the time, Stanford received about $4.5 million in NSF funding from the federal government’s Digital Library Initiative. The students created a prototype that used well-established technology to crawl from page to page by following links. They developed a system to rank Web pages by determining whether many other highly ranked Web pages linked to it. The students wrote a paper on their ideas and tested it on live data on the Internet. The work, called the PageRank method, survives as one of the main components of today’s Google search service, the NSF says on its website. "Page and Brin obtained funding that allowed them to move their growing hardware facility from the Stanford campus into a friend’s garage and to incorporate Google, Inc.," the NSF website says. "The rest, as they say, is history." Page, now Google’s CEO, and Brin, who now directs the company’s special projects, each have a reported net financial worth of about $18 billion. They no longer work from a garage. Google’s company history does not mention the federal government. An email (Google suggests it’s easier to contact it this way) to the massive company’s media relations office wasn’t returned. Mark Malseed co-wrote a book called "The Google Story" that chronicled the company’s birth and extraordinary growth. He and co-author David Vise, a former Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, interviewed Google’s co-founders and about two dozen others for the book. Malseed believes the NSF grant played a small role in Google’s development. He doesn’t believe they even mention the NSF in the book. "It feels like a little bit of a stretch on this one to me," Malseed said of Obama’s claim. Page and Brin needed more disk space to corral their voluminous data and used computers and some other resources that Stanford had available through the grant, Malseed said. The two students, Malseed said, realized they needed additional resources not available at Stanford to continue their work and obtained private startup money to create what became Google. Malseed guessed the president’s statement came from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who was reportedly an informal adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign. "It’s not a false claim in that the project originated while Larry was working under the DLI," Malseed said. "But to insinuate that [claim] leaves out the initial funding raised from entrepreneurs." Ronald Rice, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, gave the federal government more credit. Rice, co-director of the university’s Carsey-Wolf Center Department of Communication, has co-written a book on the Internet and teaches courses on new media. He said the president’s statement in Atlanta is part of a larger debate that government funding of research and development leads to innovation, which leads to economic growth and strategic influence. "NSF grants are intended to do just those kinds of things. We talk about the importance of [research and development] investment -- and this is one of the sources," Rice said via email. A division within the U.S. Defense Department called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency created an early network of time-sharing computers that is widely viewed as forming the basis of the Internet, which could be credited as helping lead to Google. Is that a better argument in support of Obama’s claim? "If there was no Internet, there would be no search engines," Malseed said. "But you can say that about a lot of things." It’s clear that Google’s co-founders used resources from the NSF for their work. Some, such as Malseed, say those resources were helpful, but a part of the puzzle. We believe the president’s statement is technically accurate. But it might give a bit too much credit to the government’s role in Google’s development. We rate Obama’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-10755	Clinton has "raised the most money from Washington lobbyists ... from the health industry, drug companies, health insurance companies (and) the defense industry."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/31/john-edwards/no-1-in-most-categories-/	At a Democratic debate on Oct. 30, 2007, John Edwards criticized Hillary Clinton for taking lots of campaign contributions from lobbyists and others who have a stake in Washington's influence battles. He said, "Do you believe that the candidate who's raised the most money from Washington lobbyists, Democrat or Republican, the candidate who's raised the most money from the health industry, drug companies, health insurance companies, the candidate who's raised the most money from the defense industry, Republican or Democrat -- and the answer to all of those questions is: That's Senator Clinton." John Edwards is mostly correct in his accounting: Judging from campaign finance filings, Clinton is the favorite candidate of lobbyists and the health care industry. However, there is conflicting data about whether she is the biggest recipient of campaign contributions from the defense industry. An analysis this month by the Center for Responsive Politics and the New York Times shows that as of September 30, 2007, Clinton had received $2.7 million from the health care industry, 24 percent of all contributions to candidates from that industry. The next most popular recipient of health care industry funds was Barack Obama, who pulled in $2.2 million, or 19 percent of the total. Clinton was also, as Edwards asserts, the leading recipient of money from employees of drug companies and health insurance companies. Edward's claim about Clinton's contributions from lobbyists also holds true, but with a caveat. Clinton raised $517,525 from registered lobbyists in the first three quarters of this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. This is $200,000 more than the next biggest recipient, Republican John McCain, and more than twice as much as the second biggest Democratic recipient, Chris Dodd. These numbers, however, reflect a broad definition of lobbyists. They not only include what Edwards calls "Washington lobbyists" — those registered with Congress -- but also include those who work on the state and local level. Clinton accepts contributions from federal lobbyists (Edwards and Obama do not), making it likely that much of her total haul from lobbyists comes from those in Washington. But is Clinton also the favored candidate of the defense industry? That depends on the numbers you look at. In October, the Huffington Post, a liberal blog, analyzed Federal Election Commission data on the campaign contributions from employees of the top five U.S. arms makers. Their study found that these individuals gave Clinton a total of $52,600, more than half of the total going to all Democratic candidates and equal to 60 percent of the total for Republican presidential hopefuls. But more extensive data analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics shows that the number one recipient from defense industry employees is, in fact, Dodd. The single-digit-polling Senator from Connecticut gathered $168,800 from the defense industry in the first nine months of this year, the Center found, while Clinton came in a close second with $123,583. So overall, we find Edwards attack on Clinton to be Mostly True.	None	John Edwards	None	None	None	2007-10-31T00:00:00	2007-10-30	['Bill_Clinton', 'Washington,_D.C.']
pomt-05732	Pasco County "opened 22 new schools over six years to keep pace with growth in student population and implement the class size amendment."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/04/heather-fiorentino/pasco-county-school-district-keeping-class-size-re/	In seeking reelection to a third term, Pasco County schools superintendent Heather Fiorentino is touting the district’s record as proof of her successful leadership. In a press release announcing her bid, she cited statistics ranging from graduation rates to the number of new schools built as evidence that "the District School Board of Pasco County continues to shine with Fiorentino at the helm." Fiorentino’s facts and figures are generally correct, but they don’t always tell the full story. We evaluated several statements from her press release. Here, we're examining if the district "opened 22 new schools over six years to keep pace with growth in student population and implement the class size amendment." The school district’s own website contradicts Fiorentino on this one. It lists just 20 new schools as having opened from 2005 through 2011. Fiorentino said Friday that the press release contained a typo and agreed that the correct number is 20. This building boom did take place to help the district deal with rapidly increasing enrollment. The district’s student body grew from 59,474 at the end of the 2004-05 school year to 66,696 by the end of 2010-11. And, for a time, the new schools did help reduce class sizes district-wide. But when it came time to implement the class size amendment in 2011-12, even with enrollment changed only slightly, the district did not meet the 2002 voter requirement for smaller classes. The state imposed a $4 million penalty against Pasco for its failure to comply, the fourth-highest fine among the 35 districts that did not meet the rule. Fiorentino and the School Board have since submitted a plan to the state Department of Education for meeting the amendment in 2012, which could reduce the punishment. While the district did open many new schools to cope with growth and class size, it didn’t open the same number Fiorentino said and it didn’t meet class size rules every year.

pomt-08917	The Latino unemployment rate is higher than the white rate and the black rate is higher than the Latino rate.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/27/marc-morial/marc-morial-correct-unemployment-rates-whites-blac/	On July 25, 2010, David Gregory, the host of NBC's Meet the Press, asked his roundtable panelists to consider "Diversity and the Myth of White Privilege," a Wall Street Journal op-ed column from July 22, in which Sen. James Webb, D-Va., argues against federal affirmative action laws. "I have dedicated my political career to bringing fairness to America's economic system and to our work force, regardless of what people look like or where they may worship," Webb wrote. "Unfortunately, present-day diversity programs work against that notion, having expanded so far beyond their original purpose that they now favor anyone who does not happen to be white. In an odd historical twist that all Americans see but few can understand, many programs allow recently arrived immigrants to move ahead of similarly situated whites whose families have been in the country for generations. These programs have damaged racial harmony. And the more they have grown, the less they have actually helped African-Americans, the intended beneficiaries of affirmative action as it was originally conceived." Marc Morial -- president of the National Urban League, a century-old civil rights organization -- was one panelist who took the challenge, arguing that non-whites continue to experience disadvantages compared to whites. "I don't agree that Latinos and Asians have not suffered discrimination in this country or that Native Americans have not suffered discrimination in this country," Morial said. "I think the question is, how do you target and tailor policies that are going to help all economically and socially disadvantaged people. And it's a fair debate to have, but it also needs to be positive with facts. Look at the Latino unemployment rate. It's higher than the white rate. The black rate is higher than the Latino rate. So to suggest that there are not disparities that affect the Latino community, that affect the Native American community, most in depth, the African-American community, we've got to have the discussion that Jim Webb wants to have. We have facts, real facts, that give a picture of how life is in this nation." We won't take sides on Webb's proposal to end policies that provide race-based advantages, a topic that inspires passions on both sides, but which isn't a checkable fact. Instead, we'll focus on the narrower question of whether Morial is accurate on the question of comparative unemployment rates for whites, blacks and Latinos. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates seasonally adjusted unemployment rates by race and ethnicity. We found that in June 2010, the white unemployment rate was 8.6 percent. The black unemployment rate was 15.4 percent, and the Hispanic/Latino rate was 12.4. So Morial is correct that the Latino unemployment rate is higher than the white rate and that the black rate is higher than the Latino rate. Though it falls beyond the boundaries of our fact-check, we'll note one other point from the statistics. Morial argued that Latinos and Asian Americans have suffered discrimination in the United States, and we think most people would agree with that at least as a historical matter. But if you look at the unemployment rate for Asians, it's 7.7 percent. That's actually lower than the rate for whites. (Technically, the BLS only calculates a non-seasonally-adjusted rate for Asians, but the comparable rate for whites is still higher at 8.7 percent.) Still, as we indicated, Morial made no specific claim about unemployment among Asian-Americans, and for the groups that he did mention -- whites, blacks and Latinos -- his numbers were accurate. So we rate his comment True.	None	Marc Morial	None	None	None	2010-07-27T17:26:24	2010-07-25	['None']

pomt-01299	"Before World War II, very few people actually had health insurance."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/oct/30/james-carr/carr-says-prior-wwii-very-few-people-had-health-in/	Libertarian James Carr doesn’t agree that health care requires health insurance. Carr, who is facing Republican Dave Brat and Democrat Jack Trammell in the race for Virginia’s 7th District congressional seat, provided some historic perspective to highlight that point in an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "Before World War II -- with wage freezes, when health care became attached to a job -- very few people actually had health insurance," said Carr, a community hospital administrator. What caught our attention here is Carr’s statement that "very few" people had health insurance prior to World War II. Currently, most Americans have some form of health insurance, so we wondered whether Carr was correct. So how does Carr justify his statement? His campaign manager, Jill Anderson, pointed us to a half-dozen documents about health care coverage in the U.S. One of them, a 1965 publication by the Social Security Administration, said that in 1930, there were probably 1.5 million to 2 million Americans who had some kind of private health insurance or pre-arranged payment plan for medical care. With a population of 123.2 million people then, that means that less than 2 percent of the population had private coverage. Private coverage was generally the only option. The federal government’s public insurance plans -- Medicare and Medicaid -- were created in the 1960s. Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau show that 12.3 million Americans (9.3 percent) had private health coverage for their hospital stays in 1940, a jump of 10 million from a decade earlier. In 1950, 76.6 million Americans, or 50.7 percent, had health insurance. What led to that jump? Topping the list would be the amazing advances in medicine in the past 75 years. The war itself played a major role in the growth of health insurance, according to a March 2002 history of health insurance benefits from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a think tank that examines employment-based benefits. Wages had been frozen by the National War Labor Board amid a shortage of workers as many potential employees went off to fight in the war. Employers sought to get around the wage controls in order to attract scarce workers. Providing them health insurance was one way to do that, EBRI said. "During this time, employers petitioned, and were granted to have benefits, particularly health benefits, not be considered part of wages," Stephen Blakely, the director of communications and managing editor at EBRI, told us. "Congress agreed to exempt health insurance benefits from taxation." Blakely said Carr’s historic look at the prevalence of health insurance is correct. The growth in insurance was also spurred by a growth in surgeries and hospital stays. "(A)s late as the 1920s, hospitals were viewed as dangerous places where people went to die," Robert Helms, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a February 2008 paper. That perception changed gradually, Helms said, as hospitals improved management, boosted physician professional standards and developed drugs to control infections. Penicillin, an antibiotic, was used increasingly in the 1940s to control infections. This made surgeries and hospital stays safer, which led to increased demand for both surgeries and insurance to cover those procedures, Helms noted. Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health care policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said Carr’s statement is generally accurate, but isn’t relevant to today. Back in 1940, medical care was relatively basic, he said. A victim of a heart attack, for example, would have been ordered to rest in bed, Oberlander said. With today’s advanced medical care the treatment would require surgeries and care that’s very expensive to pay for without insurance, he said. "There is not a feasible medical care system without health insurance in 2014," Oberlander said. Roughly 85 percent of the 310 million people in the U.S. had some form of health care insurance in 2012 either through their job, public programs like Medicare and Medicaid, or individual private plans, according to figures compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That leaves 15 percent of the population -- about 48 million Americans -- who lacked health care coverage. Our ruling Carr said before World War II, very few people had health insurance. While Carr doesn’t take into account the advances in medical care over the past 75 years, he’s right. Only about 10 percent of the U.S. population had private health insurance then, generally from an employer-based system. We rate his statement True.

pomt-15381	"The United States doesn’t have the highest murder rate among developed countries. You look at Russia, you look at Brazil, those are countries that have 3 to 5 times higher murder rates than what we have here in the United States."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/30/john-lott/gun-advocate-refutes-obamas-statement-cites-murder/	Following the mass shooting in Charleston, S.C., President Barack Obama claimed that "mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency." PolitiFact rated that claim Mostly False. The next day, Obama slightly altered his wording to make his claim more accurate. During a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Obama said that "you don’t see murder on this kind of scale, this kind of frequency in any other advanced nation on Earth." Still, Obama’s words were not without criticism. We flagged one claim from John R. Lott, Jr., founder of the Crime Prevention Research Center, a pro-gun research group. "The thing that most disappoints me with regard to the president is he just keeps on putting out information that is clearly false," Lott said on Fox News June 24, 2015. "I mean, in the clip that you had, the United States doesn’t have the highest murder rate among developed countries. "You look at Russia, you look at Brazil, those are countries that have 3 to 5 times higher murder rates than what we have here in the United States. There are other countries which are similar to us." PunditFact decided to take a closer look at his claim. We found Lott referenced the same information in an article published in the New York Daily News that same day. "Among developed countries … the U.S. isn’t anywhere close to having the highest homicide rate. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the arbiter of which countries are considered industrialized, ranks Russia and Brazil far ahead of the U.S., with homicide rates that are respectively 2 1/2 to five times higher than ours. Our rate was tied with Chile’s, and just slightly above the average for developed countries." Lott’s claim has a couple areas worthy of fact checking. First of all, do Russia’s and Brazil’s crime rates match what Lott said? And second, are Russia and Brazil even considered to be developed countries as Lott seems to indicate? Just the numbers PunditFact reached out to Lott for more information about his claim. Lott cited data gathered by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). According to the report (which includes statistics for 2011, the latest available year), the United States has a homicide rate of 5.2 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Comparatively, Russia has a homicide rate of 12.8 murders, and Brazil has a rate of 25.5 murders. With these numbers, Russia’s rate comes out to be 2.46 times greater than that of the United States, and Brazil’s murder rate comes out to be 4.90 times larger than that of the United States. Lott mentioned Chile in his op-ed in the Daily News. That country’s murder rate is 4.4 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, which is actually less than the rate of the United States. Other sources largely support the OECD research, and Lott’s use of the numbers. According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime’s study, in 2011 the United States had a homicide rate of 4.7 murders per 100,000 people, Russia’s murder rate was 9.6 per 100,000 people and Brazil’s rate was 23.4. According to this data, Russia’s murder rate was 2.04 times higher than that of the United States, and Brazil’s was 4.97 times greater. That’s close to what Lott said. Developed or Developing? Now comes the trickier part of Lott’s claim. Lott was reacting to Obama’s use of the word "advanced" to describe a group of countries, and saying Obama was providing false information. Lott described a group of counties with the word "developed" and included Brazil and Russia. Those words are important, and whether you consider Brazil or Russia advanced and/or developed makes all the difference. The OECD is currently comprised of 34 member countries and lists Brazil and Russia as "key partners." But just because the OECD includes these 36 countries when compiling its Better Life Index does not mean that they are all automatically classified as developed nations. The OECD’s member countries "include many of the world’s most advanced countries but also emerging countries like Mexico, Chile and Turkey." PunditFact reached out to OECD’s Better Life Index to inquire what criteria was used to distinguish between ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ countries, but did not hear back. However, other experts shed some light on the issue. According to Massimo Morelli, Columbia University professor of political science and economics, Brazil and Russia are considered intermediate countries. They are not "developing" nations, but not quite considered "advanced/developed," either. "The so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are those who moved from developing to developed very fast due to fast growth rates, but they are definitely not advanced yet," Morelli said. However, he did note that out of the four intermediate countries, both Russia and China may be considered advanced in some respects. Leonid Peisakhin, assistant professor of politics at New York University in Abu Dhabi, agreed. "There is no hard definition for what an advanced country is. There are different markers having to do with human development levels, levels of industrialization, income per capita, size of the services sector, etc. Russia is a tricky case, as it is, in fact, highly industrialized; however, Russia does not have very high income or human development levels. Brazil is less ambiguously a developing economy," he said. However, even some of these factors are not always clear cut. "If you define ‘advanced’ countries based on something simple such as per capita real GDP, I think that you are going to have a hard time including countries such as Chile, Poland, Greece, Portugal, and many others, but not include Russia," Lott said in a follow-up statement to PunditFact. The World Bank uses GNI (Gross National Income), and not GDP, as its prime indicator. (The total national income is divided by the population of the country to determine the GNI per capita.) In 2013, Brazil’s GNI per capita was $11,690. Russia’s was $13,850. Using the World Bank definition, Brazil is classified as having an upper-middle-income economy, which places it under the category of a developing nation. Russia is ranked as a high-income nation, and is not labeled as "developing." For comparison the U.S. GNI in 2013 was $53,470. Meanwhile, the World Trade Organization allows members to decide for themselves how to classify themselves, although other member countries can dispute the decision. "Setting aside these ambiguities, there can be no doubt that the U.S. should be compared to other countries with similar levels of income and development and a similar historical trajectory: Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. These are all highly advanced and developed economies with similar historical trajectories and consequently functional rule of law systems," said Peisakhin. One final note: Out of the nations observed, the United States’ murder rate was only exceeded by three countries in the study: Brazil, Russia, and Mexico. (Mexico is considered emerging or developing by most organizations, including OECD.) Our ruling Lott said that the "United States doesn’t have the highest murder rate among developed countries. You look at Russia, you look at Brazil, those are countries that have 3 to 5 times higher murder rates than what we have here in the United States." Although the specific murder rates vary across different sources, Lott’s statement about Russia’s and Brazil’s murder rates did match up with the information the OECD had. What didn’t quite match up was the consensus on how to classify Brazil and Russia. They are advanced on some fronts, especially Russia, but not as developed as others. Ultimately, they may not be the best choice when comparing murder rates in the United States and other "developed" nations. Lott’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-03945	"The majority of (the American people) voted for a Democratic House."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/	Republicans control the U.S. House of Representatives by 33 seats, an advantage Speaker John Boehner once suggested gives them a mandate to block tax increases. Some House Democrats have countered this idea with their own talking point: GOP members may control more seats, but they did not win the popular vote in 2012. U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, mentioned it to Capitol reporters on Feb. 12, 2013. "The American people elected a Democratic president, a Democratic Senate, and the majority of them voted for a Democratic House, but we have a Republican House, and it's necessary for all sides to come together and take responsible action," Hoyer said. It’s a claim that’s been repeated several times in recent months, so we decided to check it out. Hoyer spokeswoman Stephanie Young directed us to a December 2012 analysis by the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan, Washington, D.C. publication that analyzes and handicaps congressional and gubernatorial races, with the headline "House GOP Won 49 Percent of Votes, 54 Percent of Seats." (The story and corresponding chart are accessible to subscribers only.) By Cook’s calculations, House Democrats out-earned their Republican counterparts by 1.17 million votes. Read another way, Democrats won 50.59 percent of the two-party vote. Still, they won just 46.21 percent of seats, leaving the Republicans with 234 seats and Democrats with 201. It was the second time in 70 years that a party won the majority of the vote but didn’t win a majority of the House seats, according to the analysis. The National Republican Congressional Committee did not dispute these findings. NRCC spokesman Dan Scarpinato pointed out that Republicans enjoy a comfy majority, their second largest since World War II (234 seats in 2012, 242 seats in 2010). Cook’s House editor David Wasserman pointed to two "unprecedented" factors that explain the phenomenon: the thick concentration of Democratic votes in urban areas and the GOP’s wide control of drawing congressional districts in 2010. For the record, Wasserman considers the House popular vote an imperfect read of the nation’s attitude about House party control, for several reasons. Weak opposition to incumbents in many districts will usually lead to a bloated vote count for the incumbent party. In some districts, a "personally popular moderate" will usually outperform his or her party’s national popularity. And a new top-two primary system in California, which featured eight districts with races between two Democrats or two Republicans, meant the other party did not get any votes in some cases. Regardless, he wrote, House Democrats will need to win 55 percent of all House votes cast in order to win a majority of seats for the next decade. (That has only happened twice in the last 15 cycles, he wrote.) What if we consider votes for candidates whose political party is not Democratic or Republican? Michael McDonald, George Mason University public affairs professors, says it’s almost certain the Democrats would not maintain their majority of the popular vote. However, the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, which publishes official vote counts of federal elections, has not yet posted its 2012 tally. (McDonald thought the delay in posting may be due to New York pushing back its reporting due to Hurricane Sandy.) Still, "I am certain we will find that the Democrats received more votes than Republicans," McDonald said. Wasserman compiled his own tally of the national popular vote for House races. With the addition of late December data from New York, the Democratic advantage widened to 1.36 million votes. According to his breakdown, House Democratic candidates got 49.15 percent of the vote, Republicans got 48.03 percent, and other candidates got 2.81 percent. Again, that means the Democrats gained a plurality of the vote. Looking at the data this way shows that third parties, not Democrats, are really more disenfranchised in terms of votes versus seats, said Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. "They win almost 3 percent of the vote but get 0 percent of the seats," McGhee said. Our ruling Hoyer said the majority of Americans "voted for a Democratic House." We found an impartial and thorough analysis that supports his claim, at least when considering votes for the two dominant parties. Indeed, Democrats earned a majority. When considering votes for candidates of all parties, House Democrats still earned the most votes. But the share is a plurality, not a majority. It’s a small but noteworthy difference.

Some bloggers have been promoting the idea that the group, which originated from Honduras, hates America. Among their sources of evidence: an Associated Press photograph showing two people holding up a burning U.S. flag that has been defaced with a swastika. Breitbart included the photo at the top of its Oct. 22 story headlined, "Protesters in Support of Caravan Paint Swastika on American Flag, Burn It in the Street." The story has now been shared more than 20,000 times on Facebook. Soon after Breitbart posted its story, Pamela Geller president of the conservative American Freedom Defense Initiative, embedded the Breitbart story into her own blog with a different headline, "'Caravan' Migrant Army Paint Swastika on American Flag, Burn It in the Street." These stories were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Geller, who describes herself as a practitioner of "independent, investigative journalism," then shared her blog post on Twitter and Facebook, writing, "Is it any wonder the Democrat (sic) party of treason is fighting to bring this horror into the country?" But her characterization of the photo being a picture of caravan participants is wrong. The AP photo was taken at a protest in Honduras at a time when the caravan had already passed through Guatemala and was stalled at its border with Mexico. The caption that accompanied Associated Press photographer Fernando Antonio's image said, "Two people burn a United States flag during a protest in favor of the caravan of migrants that is currently stuck on the Guatemala-Mexico border, in front of the American embassy, in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Friday, Oct. 19, 2018." Contacted by email about the photo on Thursday, Anita Baca, AP photo editor for Latin America & the Caribbean, again confirmed that the photo did not depict migrants participating in the caravan. The photo was made, Baca wrote, "in front of the U. S embassy during a Friday night, Oct. 19th protest against Trump’s response to the caravan and also as a show of solidarity for the caravan." Geller did not respond to an email or a Facebook message. So, while Breitbart accurately characterized the flag-burning as being the work of protesters, that didn’t stop other bloggers from mischaracterizing its origin. Like Geller, conservative Christian blogger Bob Williamson posted the AP photo and, referring to the caravan, said, "The worst thing I've seen is them painting a swastika on our American flag and then burning it. What the heck are these people thinking?" A poster at conservativeunderground.com gave the photograph this headline: "Honduran 'Refugees' Paint Swastika On Our Flag Then Burn It." Our ruling This photograph was taken by an AP photographer during a protest in Honduras that was staged in support of migrants caravanning to the U.S. border. It does not show members of the "caravan migrant army" burning a defaced U.S. flag. We rate this claim False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-10-25T15:58:08	2018-10-22	['None']
pomt-05174	Virginia women earn "only 79 cents to each dollar earned by men..."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-virginia-women-earn-79-cents-every-/	Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine fired off a fundraising email June 6 lamenting the defeat of the Paycheck Fairness Act the day before. The legislation would have barred companies from retaliating against employees who inquire about pay discrimination and opened avenues for female workers to sue for punitive damages in cases of pay bias. Kaine’s email called the bill’s failure "the latest example of women’s rights legislation being targeted by Republicans in the Senate." Kaine’s wrote, "With a few more votes, we would have made an important step forward in helping narrow the gap between what women currently earn -- here in Virginia, only 79 cents to each dollar earned by men -- and the equal pay that they deserve," the email said. Do working women in Virginia really earn only 79 percent of the pay of men? We checked. Gender pay data Kaine’s statement was based on two reports, according to Lily Adams, a campaign spokeswoman. Both the National Women’s Law Center and the National Partnership for Women and Families, supporters of the Fairness Act, created fact sheets on wage disparity in each state. The organizations relied on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which tracks annual wages in its Current Population Survey. In 2010, the statistics and showed women made 77 cents for every dollar men earned across the country. President Barack Obama and other Democrats used the figure to urge passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act. The Census Bureau also reports state figures in its American Community Survey. They show in Virginia, women earned 79 cents for every dollar men made in 2010. But the annual wage comparisons does not take into consideration those who work less than full-time and less than year-round. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at weekly wages instead of annual pay. The national median pay for women was $669 a week in 2010, or 81 percent of men’s median weekly pay of $824. The weekly wage data does not include the pay of self-employed people. But it does factor those who do not work year-round, such as teachers, some construction workers and seasonal workers. And, as with the annual figures, men tend to work more hours. In Virginia, BLS figures show women in 2010 earned a median $719 a week, or 75.2 percent of men’s median weekly pay of $956. So while using weekly figures narrows the gender wage gap nationally, it broadens the disparity in Virginia. The national gender gap shrinks for workers paid hourly rates. Women are paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men, according to the BLS data for 2010. This data includes those who work part-time, a status women seek more than men, according to a Pew Research Center survey. In 2010, 27 percent of women worked part-time compared to 13 percent of men did in 2010. State-specific data is not available for hourly wages. Which numbers are the best? Experts disagree on the best way to measure pay disparity and why women make less than men. "Hourly wage ratios are better than annual or weekly but none of them get to the important reasons for wage differentials," said June O’Neill, director of the Center for the Study of Business and Government at Baruch College at the City University of New York. She added, "The underlying reason for the various differentials have been spelled out by me and other economists -- namely that women's greater ties to child care limit their choices of occupations and type of work." O’Neill’s research shows that single, childless women make about the same as single, childless men in the same education in the same occupations. An 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh also concluded that the wage gap is not simply a product of sexism. CONSAD found that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by other trends common to women: they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages; they tend have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men; they tend to have a shorter work history and take more time off from work for childbirth and child care. CONSAD said these factors, when considered, reduce the pay gap to between 4 to 7 percent, which could be result of discrimination. "As a result, it is not possible now, and doubtless will never be possible, to determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap is not attributable to factors that compensate women and men different on socially acceptable bases, and hence can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women," the report said. But where CONSAD concluded that adjusting for variables reduces the likelihood of discrimination, others disagree. Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research in Washington, said bias is not limited to the walls of the workplace. She said society expects women to work fewer hours than men so they can care for children. "The focus on saying, ‘Is it direct discrimination?’ neglects that only part of this is direct discrimination," she said in an interview. "Really the rest is that women are more likely to take time out when they have children, but the question is whether you think that’s right when men and women have children but women are taking time off?" She said the data that shows a 21-cent gap in Virginia has been used the longest and "provides the best reference for change over time." And the full-time, year-round employees the annual data includes are the "most committed" to work. "Whichever way you measure a wage gap, a wage gap remains," Hegewisch said. Our ruling Tim Kaine said women earn 79 cents to each dollar that men earn in Virginia. Of the two databases that measure pay for men and women in each state, Kaine used the one with the smaller earning gap in Virginia and described its finding accurately. But gender pay is a complicated subject and there are many reasons -- in addition to discrimination -- why a gap exists: women tend to work fewer hours than men; they tend to choose lower paying professions than men; they tend to take more time off than men to tend to children. Kaine’s statement lacks this context. It creates an impression that men are being paid much more than women when their qualifications, occupations and work hours are the same. So we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2012-06-15T12:32:28	2012-06-06	['None']
pomt-05840	"Obamacare ... will kill jobs across America."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/15/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-commerce-ad-attacking-tim-kaine-says-he/	In a recent television ad, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- the nation’s leading group representing businesses -- jumped on former Virginia Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine for his support of President Barack Obama’s health care law. It's a job-killer, the ad charged. Kaine, who was chairman of the Democratic National Committee when the battle to pass the health care battle was underway, is running for an open Senate seat this fall, likely against another former Virginia governor and former senator, Republican George Allen. The chamber’s ad shows a news clip of Kaine saying, "I think health care reform is going to go down in history as one of the greatest achievements of this president." The ad counters that comment by saying, "Obamacare could cost Virginia up to $2.8 billion and will kill jobs across America." Killing jobs across America seems like a pretty serious side effect, so we decided to check that claim. We should note that the health care law is complicated, and projections about what it may or may not do are to a large degree speculative. Key parts of the legislation don't take effect until 2014, and even after that, it will take time for workers and employers to see how the law plays out. Still, we think we have enough expert information to analyze the chamber’s claim. Below, we’ll first recap what we wrote about a similar claim about a year ago. Then we’ll analyze some of the material the Chamber provided us as support for the ad’s claim. Our previous analysis In January 2011, we fact checked a claim by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, also of Virginia. that the health care law was "job killing." We rated that False. He backed up that claim with a Republican document titled, "Obamacare: A budget-busting, job-killing health care law," which said "Independent analyses have determined that the health care law will cause significant job losses for the U.S. economy: the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that the law will reduce the 'amount of labor used in the economy by … roughly half a percent...,' an estimate that adds up to roughly 650,000 jobs lost. A study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), the nation's largest small business association, found that an employer mandate alone could lead to the elimination of 1.6 million jobs, with 66 percent of those coming from small businesses." The CBO study, published in August 2010, concluded that the law will reduce "the amount of labor used in the economy." But that’s not exactly what the GOP had said. The CBO concluded that some workers are staying in jobs mostly to keep their health insurance, and once they have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, for instance, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might voluntarily work less. The CBO describes this as a "small segment" of the population and described it in reduced work hours, not lost jobs. So it never used the 650,000 number that the Republican document cites. In addition, someone who chooses to work less is not a victim of a job being "killed" by federal legislation. (We checked with CBO and they confirmed that the agency’s numbers from August 2010 remain its most recent estimate.) Meanwhile, the other piece of evidence offered by the GOP leadership document -- the NFIB study titled, "Small Business Effects of a National Employer Healthcare Mandate," -- was problematic for several reasons. For starters, NFIB isn’t neutral. The small-business group has long been critical of Obama’s approach to health care. The group formally advocates repealing the law, calling it "deeply flawed" and "built on a foundation of destructive employer and individual mandates that hamper job growth and threaten our nation’s economic recovery." Second, the NFIB study assumed that all companies would be required to offer private health insurance to their employees, and that the employers would have to pay for at least half of the cost of insurance premiums. That didn't turn out to be the case in the final version of the health care law. The law exempts companies with 50 or fewer workers from any mandate, so many of the small firms "most adversely affected" in the NFIB study are not required to offer insurance. For all these reasons, we rated Cantor’s claim that the health care law was "job-killing" was False. The new Chamber of Commerce claim What about the ad criticizing Kaine? The chamber pointed us to two documents as support for their claim. One of those is a brief from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has been critical of trhe law; the other is a newer study from NFIB. We’ll take these documents in order. The Heritage brief argues that the cost of the tax penalty on employers with more than 50 employees "will ultimately be borne by workers (lower wages and fewer jobs), shareholders (lower profits), and consumers (higher prices)." Since the ad only looked at the question of employment, we won’t consider the other issues here. On the law’s employment impact, the brief reiterated the CBO point that we discussed above (and disagreed with). Separately, it argued that "many individuals earning close to the minimum wage will not be worth hiring if the employer is required to offer them health insurance coverage. Research by Katherine Baicker and Helen Levy finds that a third of uninsured workers earn within $3 of the minimum wage and therefore have a higher risk of losing their jobs because of an employer mandate. Furthermore, these workers are disproportionately likely to be high school dropouts, minority, or female." We looked up the paper by Baicker and Levy and found that Heritage left out a key bit of context that undercuts the paper’s relevance for the notion that the health care law is a job killer. The paper the two economists wrote -- which came out in 2007, long before the health care law was being debated -- addresses a more aggressive mechanism of employer mandates than the one included in the final version of the bill. We asked the authors whether they approved of how Heritage used their paper. In a joint email to PolitiFact, Baicker and Levy wrote that they don't. "As we noted in the paper," they wrote, "anything that exempts employers from the mandate or reduces the cost borne by employers will mitigate the impact on employment. In the Obama plan, the fact that small employers (fewer than 50 employees) are exempt from the mandate and the fact that the penalty associated with not providing health insurance ($2,000 per worker, or about one dollar per hour for a full-time worker) is fairly small would both suggest relatively little impact on employment. Furthermore, the presence of an individual mandate has implications for workers' valuation of health insurance benefits offered by employers. All of this means that our paper does not provide evidence that the (health care law) would cause job loss." So the authors of the paper cited by Heritage disagree that their research backs up the notion that the health care law is a job killer. Others feel similarly. Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who advised Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on health-insurance programs, said he’s skeptical lower-wage employment will be affected in a big way, given that many of the firms that employ low-wage workers are small (and thus are exempt from the law) and that many low-wage workers employed by bigger companies already have access to health insurance (and thus shouldn’t see changes from the law). Henry Aaron, a health care expert at the Brookings Institution, pointed to a couple additional reasons to doubt the low-wage worker argument. Many low-wage workers are teens or in their early 20s, and they may be covered under their parents' plans if they wish. (In fact, the Obama law actually raised the upper age limit for dependents covered on a parent’s plan to 26, a provision that’s already in force.) In addition, some low-wage workers work fewer than 30 hours per week, and under the law, the mandate does not apply to workers who work less than that threshold. So what about the second piece of evidence, the NFIB study? That study also attracted criticism when we ran it past economists with expertise in health care and labor policy. The newer NFIB study projected that changes made by the health care will lead to price increases that "reduce private sector employment by 125,000 to 249,000 jobs in 2021, with 59 percent of those losses falling on small business." But experts outlined a number of reasons to be skeptical that the impact will be so large. First, the employer payments under the law are "tiny," said David Cutler, a Harvard University economist. The CBO estimated that employer and individual penalty payments will be $3 billion in 2014 and $12 billion in 2016. "Even today, total employee compensation is $8.3 trillion," Cutler said. "So, they are claiming enormous effects from payments that are less than 0.2 percent of employee compensation." A March 2011 analysis by the Urban Institute -- an independent research organization -- concurred, concluding that, on balance, the health care law is "unlikely to have major aggregate effects on the U.S. economy and on employment, primarily because the changes in spending and taxes are very small relative to the size of the economy." The NFIB report doesn’t appear to take into account the subsidies in the health care law, only the costs. Specifically, the Urban Institute report noted that firms with fewer than 50 workers will receive $4.5 billion in employer subsidies in the form of tax credits. Taking both premiums and assessments into account, "small businesses would save 8.7 percent compared with their current premium contributions," the report said. This means that smaller firms would actually have "lower costs of labor and should be more willing to expand employment." Medium-sized firms, for their part, would find their premium costs drop modestly, though individual companies that do not already offer health care coverage could see notable cost increases. And large firms would see an increase in premium costs by about 1 percent overall. Aaron added that employment decisions are not as cut-and-dried as critics suggest. "To the extent that workers are part of a team or group or division that is judged on its overall performance, such computations may be done on a group basis," rather than an individual basis, he said. Finally, Aaron noted that increased usage of the health care system because of the law should create jobs within the health care industry itself. These job gains would should partially offset potential job losses elsewhere. Given all of these factors, "the rhetorical hysteria explicit in the term ‘job killer’ is enough to make one despair for rational public debate," Aaron said. Our ruling The ad said that "Obamacare … will kill jobs across America." The chamber of Commerce has failed to prove that it will, and the best projections we’ve seen, based on how the law is actually written, do not suggest that the law will "kill" jobs. A close look at the studies cited by the Chamber of Commerce in support of the ad -- as well as other independent analyses of the health care law -- provide little, if any, evidence that the health care law will result in a significant net number of job losses. We rate the statement False.	None	U.S. Chamber of Commerce	None	None	None	2012-02-15T18:10:22	2012-02-08	['United_States']
pomt-03797	"Even Roger Williams National Memorial in my home state of Rhode Island attracted nearly 51,000 visitors in 2011, with non local visitors adding more than $3.2 million to the local economy."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/27/jack-reed/us-sen-jack-reed-says-51000-people-visit-roger-wil/	As the political debate over the automatic budget cuts in the federal budget imposed under the so-called "sequester" has unfolded, there’s been a lot of discussion on the potential havoc they will wreak on the military and social service spending. But other less visible agencies are being hit as well. Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed took to the floor of the U.S. Senate on Feb. 27 to make just that point, lamenting cuts to the National Park Service, and how those reductions could hurt local economies. Reed said even in a small state like Rhode Island, they would have an effect. "Even Roger Williams National Memorial in my home state of Rhode Island attracted nearly 51,000 visitors in 2011, with non-local visitors adding more than $3.2 million to the local economy," he said. Good things are supposed to come in small packages, but does the 4.5 -acre Roger Williams National Memorial really pump $3.2 million a year (about $8,767 a day) into the economy? While you can buy any number of books on Williams and his era in the park’s gift shop, there’s no admission charge and even the dog poop bags are free. We decided to visit the memorial, and the issue. Reed’s office said it got the information from the National Park Service, which tracks how many people visit its parks and other sites and how those visits contribute to local economies. When we checked with the Parks Service, we confirmed that Reed had quoted the figures accurately. The service put the number of recreational visits to the Roger Williams Memorial at 50,909 for 2011, the year Reed cited. It also pegged recreational spending by those people at $3.1 million, though that was based on 2010 figures. But are those figures realistic? At other parks, such as Grand Canyon or Yosemite, counting visitors is as easy as tallying how many people drove through the main gate or how many admissions were sold. But at an urban location such as the Roger Williams Memorial, there is no main gate, no admission paid; you just walk across the park or into the visitors center. National Park Service Program Manager Butch Street said that to come up with attendance figures for such sites, the agency takes the number of people who enter the visitors center -- tracked by staff there -- and multiplies it by 3.3. In 2011, the year Reed noted, 15,427 people entered the Roger Williams Memorial visitors center. Multiply that by 3.3 and you get 50,909. That method has produced annual visitor totals of more than 50,000 since 2009. (We did our own, extremely unscientific sample late in the morning of March 14, when it was in the low 30s and windy. One person went into the visitor center while 23 people and 1 dog walked through the park.) Once the park service gets the total visitor number, it plugs it into what it calls a Money Generation Multiplier. That’s a formula specifically designed to estimate how much each visitor spent. The formula assigns values for average spending on lodging and other purchases. The latest economic impact figures the park service has are from 2010, when the attendance formula said 51,559 visitors came to Roger Williams. The park service’s formula assumed those visitors generated 7,017 motel stays at about $277 per day, for around $1.94 million in spending. It also assumed 10,907 day trips to the park, at around $77 per party, for about $840,000 of spending and 2,215 camping visits at $145 a day, for about $322,000. Combined, that’s about $3.1 million into the Providence region’s economy. The parks service cautions that the numbers for urban sites should be seen as having a wide margin for error. "Due to the high number of visits at these units, small changes in assumed spending averages or segment mixes can swing the spending estimates by substantial amounts," it said. Edinaldo Tebaldi, a Bryant University assistant professor of economics who specializes in the use of statistics to track economic activity, said they got that part right. Tebaldi said the park service’s basic methodology was sound, in that the multipliers it used to estimate spending were generally reasonable and applied in a way consistent with professional standards. But he said his question was with the starting assumptions. "The report relies on several strong assumptions that are debatable," he said. "However, they make it clear that that is what they are doing, so they are transparent about it." The problem, Tebaldi said, is that the park service’s overall visits figure is counting people walking through the park on their way to somewhere else as visitors. "This is unreasonable and deserves further consideration," Tebaldi said. "The scope and size of the park makes it unreasonable to assume that it is the single driver of that many visitors to Rhode Island." Our ruling Sen. Jack Reed said Roger Williams National Memorial attracted nearly 51,000 visitors in 2011, "with non-local visitors adding more than $3.2 million to the local economy." Reed accurately quoted figures from the park service. We believe you can make a case for the number of visitors, considering how many local people walk their dogs in the park or just sit on benches in the shade for a quiet lunchtime read in the summer. But are families from out of state packing up the minivan, driving to Rhode Island and booking motel rooms -- or campsites -- just to see the park? Not likely. We find the statement Half True.

pomt-08123	"The cost-saving measures we put into place at Columbia/HCA drove down national health care inflation from 18% to 8% in seven years."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/dec/09/rick-scott/rick-scott-claims-his-company-caused-national-heal/	Florida Gov.-elect Rick Scott touted himself as a businessman during his 2010 campaign. Now he says that steps he took at his former health care company caused national health care inflation to drop dramatically. In a written copy of his speech to the Florida Council of 100 Governors on Nov. 18, 2010, a couple weeks after his victory, Scott said: "We need to get a waiver to reform our Medicaid program and rework our health care benefits for state employees. Consumer directed care will lower the costs and increase the available choices. I have considerable experience in driving down health care costs while maintaining quality. The cost-saving measures we put into place at Columbia/HCA drove down national health care inflation from 18% to 8% in seven years." That's a massive drop -- and a major claim to suggest that the actions of one company could take credit for driving down national health care inflation. We wanted to know what seven-year period was Scott referring to and what was his source for his figures? We contacted Scott's transition team and proceeded with our own research. First, a refresher on Scott and Columbia/HCA that we pulled from a June 11, 2010, PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter item: "Scott started what was first Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company by purchasing more hospitals. A hospital network created efficiencies. Efficiencies created profits. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. When Scott resigned as CEO in 1997, Columbia/HCA had grown to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries, Scott’s campaign says. The company employed more than 285,000 people." Scott resigned amid a federal Medicare fraud investigation that led to the company paying $1.7 billion in fines. For decades, he has worked in the field of health care at high levels -- which means he should be an expert when talking about health care inflation. In addition to running Columbia/HCA and Solantic, a chain of walk-in clinics, Scott has long weighed in on national health care policy. An Aug. 7, 2010, Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times profile of Scott stated that in the 1990s Scott was a vocal critic of then-first lady Hillary Clinton's health care plan. In 2009, he formed a political action group called Conservatives for Patients Rights which fought President Barack Obama's health care plan. In a May 11, 2009, Washington Post wrote that Scott invested $5 million of his own money into CPR and up to an additional $15 million from supporters and had been making the rounds talking with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Scott is a guy with health care and business acumen. Now, let's return to our research about national health care inflation. We contacted the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics to obtain information on inflation. Since Scott started at Columbia in 1987, we thought he might have been referring to the seven years starting at that point. We looked at the years 1987 through 1997 -- when he started at Columbia and when he left Columbia/HCA. We checked the "medical care" category, which includes physician services as well as expenses such as medications. BLS spokesman Gary Steinberg said Consumer Price Index data in the "December" category represents the 12-month change while "annual" reflects the change over 24 months. To find double-digit increases in health care inflation over a 12-month period, we had to go back to the early 1980s -- before Scott's tenure at Columbia. The data showed national inflation for medical care at 12.5 percent for 1981 and a drop to 11 percent in 1982 -- that's as high as it climbed during the 1980s or since. In 1987, when Scott started at Columbia, national health care inflation was 5.8 percent, it dropped to 4.9 in 1994, and decreased again to 2.8 percent in 1997. Those figures are vastly different from the 18 percent to 8 percent drop that Scott cited. It's worth noting that overall inflation in the U.S. also dropped between 1987, when it was 4.4 percent, and 1997, when it hit 1.7 percent, according to the CPI. Inflation refers to how much more -- or less -- the same service costs from year to year. For example in the health care arena, how much did a heart bypass cost in 2009 compared to 2008. On Dec. 7, Brian Burgess, a Scott transition team spokesman, replied to our e-mail: "Either you heard him wrong or he simply misspoke," Burgess wrote. "In fact, the numbers are even better than that. The national health care inflation rate (i.e. measured as the cost of obtaining health care coverage) was around 18% in 1987 (Rick Scott's first year as CEO) and declined to 0.2% in his last year there." (Actually, we didn't "hear" Scott at all, since the press was barred from his speech. Nor did he misspeak, since the comment is part of the prepared written remarks distributed by Scott's staff.) Burgess wrote that the source for Scott's claim was Mercer, a national HR consulting company based in New York. Burgess provided a link to a chart from Mercer called "Annual Change in Average Total Health benefit cost" for 1989 to 2006. The chart states that the data came from Mercer's national survey of employer-sponsored health plans. The chart shows costs rising 16.7 percent in 1989, peaking at 17.1 percent in 1990 and then nosediving during the next several years -- hitting 8 percent in 1993 and 0.2 percent increase in 1997 -- the year Scott left Columbia/HCA. We spoke to Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer. She sent us data from Mercer showing cost increases at 18.6 percent in 1988. But Umland said Mercer's data in that chart isn't national health care inflation -- it is the cost for employer-sponsored health plans. That means Mercer's data doesn't reflect health care consumers who use Medicare or buy their own individual plans or lack insurance entirely. Scott's tenure at Columbia/HCA coincided with a major change in health care delivery. Before the 1990s, patients picked their own doctors and then sent in an insurance claim form. But in the 1990s, health plans started putting together provider networks and negotiating with doctors to provide lower rates. That's why costs dropped as consumers moved into less expensive plans, Umland said. Later, costs started rising because doctors started negotiating. Consumers also pushed back because they didn't like restrictive networks, so those networks grew. Umland sent us a chart comparing overall inflation, workers' earnings and annual change in total health benefit cost per employee between 1988 and 2008 -- which showed dramatic changes in health benefit costs. We also spoke to Steven Ullmann, a professor and director of programs in health sector management and policy at the University of Miami. We asked: Could a single company -- such as Columbia/HCA -- claim credit for bringing down national health care inflation? "No,'' Ullmann said. "There were many factors impacting health care inflation at the time that brought it down." Ullmann agreed with Umland at Mercer that the growth of managed care brought down costs. But Scott's former company deserves some credit because HCA, as well as other for-profit chains, brought down some of their own costs, which put competitive pressures on other health care facilities to do the same, he said. But the Mercer data that Scott cited is not inflation, Ullmann said; it is the cost for employers to ensure their own employees. Burgess sent several other links to charts about health care costs but since he said Scott's claim was based on information from Mercer we decided to focus on that information. We looked at the charts and three of them still showed health care inflation at no more than 12 percent over the past three decades. And the fourth one was about employer based health care premiums and underlying health care expenditures. Let's review: Was Rick Scott's Columbia/HCA a slayer of the national health care inflation? He specifically claimed: "The cost saving measures we put into place at Columbia /HCA drove down national health care inflation from 18% to 8% in seven years." As evidence, he cited data from Mercer -- but that data was about employer costs, not national health care inflation. Health care inflation did drop between the late 1980s and the 1990s -- but not by the numbers Scott cited. And it's a stretch for Scott to suggest the actions of a single company caused that drop -- while the country was transitioning to managed care. With his hospital chain CEO background and national leadership on medical care and insurance issues, Scott should be considered a well-spoken expert on health care inflation.

pomt-07937	"While the government grew, we lost more than 2 million jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-state-union-rebuttal-says-govern/	In her Tea Party Express-sponsored rebuttal to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., sought to draw a contrast between the hemorrhaging of jobs nationally and an expansion of jobs in government. "While the government grew," she said, "we lost more than 2 million jobs." Analyzing this comment is somewhat tricky, because Bachmann’s time frame is open to interpretation (and her office didn’t return our inquiry seeking an explanation). Earlier in her comments, she referred to the jobless rate "within three months" after the stimulus bill became law, and she also referred to the month when the unemployment rate hit 9.4 percent. Since May 2009 fits both of those descriptions, we’ll assume Bachmann was using that as her yardstick. She’s also vague about which populations she’s measuring. When she says "the government," she could mean any one of three things -- government as a whole (federal, state and local), the federal government only or the federal government minus the U.S. Postal Service, a carve-out sometimes used by economists. And when she says that "we lost more than 2 million jobs," she could mean employment overall or private-sector employment only (as a counterpoint to the government employment she cited in the first half of the comparison). Because we don't know which she meant, we looked at all these options. To do this, we examined data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official arbiter of employment data. Here’s how the data breaks down between May 2009 and December 2010, the most recent month for which figures are available: • All government employment (federal, state and local). Start: 22,628,000. End: 22,259,000. Change: Down 369,000. • Federal government employment. Start: 2,865,000. End: 2,852,000. Change: Down 13,000. • Federal government employment minus the U.S. Postal Service. Start: 2,156,000. End: 2,208,700. Change: Up 52,700. • Total national employment. Start: 131,155,000. End: 130,712,000. Change: Down 443,000. • Total private sector employment. Start: 108,527,000. End: 108,453,000. Change: Down 74,000. So let’s look first at whether "the government grew." Bachmann would be wrong if she meant to refer either to total government (federal, state and local) or to total federal employment. Both of those measures lost jobs during that period. However, she’d be correct if she meant that non-Postal Service federal employment grew. Now, what about Bachmann’s claim that "we lost more than 2 million jobs"? Neither total national employment nor private-sector employment declined by anything close to her number -- at least during the period she appeared to specify. To get to 2 million total jobs lost, you have to move the baseline back to February 2009. Shifting the time frame three months in one direction or the other wouldn’t ordinarily make much of a difference, but in this case, it does, because job losses nationally were so steep during early 2009. Total employment fell from 132,823,000 in February 2009 to 130,594,000 in May, down 2.2 million jobs, and now stands at 130,712,000, down 2.1 million. So where does this leave us? When measured in two common ways, Bachmann is wrong about government jobs increasing, but she’s right using a third, less intuitive measurement -- that is, for federal employment not including the U.S. Postal Service. As for total employment, she’s off by quite a bit if you begin the clock in May 2009, but you only have to move the time frame back by three months in order to meet her 2 million threshold. So one part of her statement is untrue except by one uncommon measurement, and the other part is incorrect if the starting date is May 2009 but accurate counting from February 2009 and in tune with the general trend since the start of Obama’s term. On balance, we rate her comment Half True.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-01-27T14:07:26	2011-01-25	['None']
pomt-12055	"President (Ronald) Reagan did a similar thing. George H.W. Bush did a similar order" as former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/08/al-franken/did-reagan-and-hw-bush-issue-orders-similar-daca-a/	Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., took to the airwaves to defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy the Obama administration put in place in 2012 after Congress failed to pass immigration legislation. DACA defers the deportation of certain illegal immigrants who initially entered the United States as children. President Trump has said he would rescind it and that former President Barack Obama exceeded his authority by signing it. Not so, Franken said. "The executive order that President Obama gave on this was actually lawful," Franken said in a Sept. 5 interview on MSNBC. "President Reagan did a similar thing. George H.W. Bush did a similar order." We decided to look more closely at whether Reagan and the elder Bush took actions similar to DACA. Was Reagan’s 1987 action similar to DACA? Because Reagan and Bush are each credited with issuing multiple executive grants of immigration relief, we asked Franken’s staff to clarify which Reagan and Bush actions the senator had in mind. Franken was referring to a 1987 action Reagan took on the heels of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. That sweeping 1986 immigration overhaul granted legal status for many, but not all, illegal immigrants. Crucially, the law did not automatically apply to the spouses or children of newly-legalized immigrants, which meant families across the country were vulnerable to being split based on differences in legal status. After Congress failed to pass a bill to reduce family disruptions, Reagan drew upon his executive authority to do so on his own. His 1987 executive action to legalize the status of minor children of parents granted amnesty under the immigration overhaul affected an estimated 100,000 families. (Note that spouses and children of couples where one parent, but not both, qualified for amnesty were not included in Reagan's policy.) Reagan’s 1987 action parallels Obama’s DACA in some key ways, but differs in others. Both are examples of a president wielding his power not to apply U.S. immigration law in cases where he deems this necessary or appropriate, said David Shirk, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Using executive authority this way is not so unusual among modern presidents. As Kenneth R. Mayer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us in a previous fact-check, "Presidents going back to at least Reagan have made unilateral adjustments to immigration law -- adding exemptions, extending protection to classes not covered by existing statutes such as children and spouses, making discretionary decisions about what constitutes ‘unlawful presence’ or what categories of people here illegally will be the focus of enforcement action." An important distinction, however, is that while DACA provided a temporary reprieve from deportation, it fell short of giving legal status to eligible immigrants, as Reagan’s had done, Shirk said. "(Obama’s action) allowed undocumented immigrant children to come out of the shadows, but only as long as the executive branch adhered to the policy of DACA," he said. "Reagan's order gave undocumented immigrant children full legal status, with the possibility of permanent residency and eventual consideration for citizenship." The two policies also differ in terms of the number of people affected. Whereas Reagan’s action affected an estimated 100,000 families, nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants have taken advantage of DACA. As we’ve noted previously, critics have argued that Obama’s action is different because he did it in the face of opposition from Congress (at least from the House), whereas Reagan’s policy (and Bush’s, for that matter) was undertaken to fix "loose ends" of the 1986 immigration law. Was George H.W. Bush’s 1990 action similar to DACA? Franken’s reference to the elder Bush concerned his 1990 executive action, which like Reagan’s before him, sought to smooth off some of the rough edges of the immigration overhaul. To prevent families from being split up, Bush’s policy effectively forestalled the deportation of spouses and children of a person who gained legal status as a result of the 1986 law, a broader group than those affected by Reagan's action. Like DACA (and Reagan’s 1987 action), Bush’s action is another example of a president relying on executive authority to selectively apply U.S. immigration law so as not to deport certain undocumented immigrants. Similar to DACA, Bush’s action did not confer legal status. Rather, it granted deportation deferment that could be renewed periodically. Both permitted affected immigrants to receive work permits. There’s disagreement over how many undocumented immigrants were covered by Bush’s action. It was initially estimated to apply to up to 1.5 million, though Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors tighter immigration policies, has written that as few as 140,000 took advantage of it. So that’s either substantially larger or substantially smaller than the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients. Our ruling Franken said, "President Reagan did a similar thing. George H.W. Bush did a similar order" as Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. There are differences in the substance and circumstances of DACA, on the one hand, and the Reagan and Bush actions, on the other. But they are similar in their broad strokes and even share some specific features. Most significantly, all three are examples of presidents relying on executive authority to selectively apply U.S. immigration law to lift — or lift the risk of — deportation for large numbers of undocumented immigrants.

pomt-06048	"Opinion polls show that the majority of Americans, and the majority of New Jerseyans, favor marriage equality for same sex couples."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/12/reed-gusciora/gay-marriage-supported-majority-americans-and-majo/	Gov. Chris Christie will need some convincing, but Democratic legislators claim they have public opinion on their side as they attempt to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey. "We also must recognize that society is changing for the better, making (Assembly bill) A-1 timely," state Assemblyman Reed Gusciora (D-Mercer) said in a Jan. 9 news release. "Opinion polls show that the majority of Americans, and the majority of New Jerseyans, favor marriage equality for same sex couples." Between four national polls and two Rutgers University polls, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Gusciora has the numbers to back up his argument. But two other national polls have indicated there are slightly more opponents than supporters. "It’s not a solid majority yet, but many polls are showing a majority," said Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University’s Polling Institute. "(Gusciora is) probably on safe ground with that claim, certainly here in the state of New Jersey." First, let’s talk about the state polls. In each of two polls conducted last year by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, 52 percent of New Jersey residents said same-sex marriage should be legal in the Garden State. The most recent poll, which was done in October, found that 39 percent oppose legalizing same-sex marriage. For the most recent poll, the margin of error attributed to those percentages was 4.7 percent. "I think it is a fair statement," said David Redlawsk, a political science professor and director of the Rutgers-Eagleton poll, referring to Gusciora’s claim. "Nationally, we’re seeing the same general trend." Now, let’s turn to how Americans across the nation view same-sex marriage. Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, pointed to a Gallup poll conducted in May, when 53 percent of respondents said same-sex marriage should be legal. That figure marked a nine percent increase over a 2010 poll asking the same question. The margin of error for the May poll was 4 percent. We also found three other national polls that demonstrate similar support for same-sex marriage. Two ABC News/Washington Post polls conducted last year put the level of support at slightly more than 50 percent. A CNN poll done in April also found that 51 percent of respondents support legalizing same-sex marriage. The margins of error for those polls was 3.5 percent. However, when you factor in the margins of error, a majority of Americans might only support same-sex marriage based on one of those four national polls. Also, two other national polls conducted last year suggest that opposition to same-sex marriage remains strong. A Pew Research Center poll done in late February and early March found that 45 percent of respondents support same-sex marriage and 46 percent oppose it. That poll had a margin of error of 3 percent. In July, a Quinnipiac University poll determined that 48 percent of registered voters would oppose a state law legalizing same-sex marriage and 46 percent would support one. The margin of error was 2 percent. Still, both of those polls demonstrate that public support for same-sex marriage has increased. Compared to a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in April 2009, the percentage of respondents who support a state law allowing same-sex marriage has increased by 8 percent. Hester defended Gusciora’s claim in an email: "Polls have shown support for marriage equality. Assemblyman Gusciora accurately and responsibly cited those polls. His statement was true." Our ruling Gusciora claimed, "Opinion polls show that the majority of Americans, and the majority of New Jerseyans, favor marriage equality for same sex couples." Two state polls and four national polls show that slightly more than 50 percent of respondents support legalizing same-sex marriage. But the margins of error among those national polls could mean greater support than opposition in only one of those polls. Two other national polls also suggest a closely divided electorate, but still show that public support for same-sex marriage has increased in recent years. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-12053	"Schools in Austin Independent School District are teaching children as young as 4 years old that their gender is fluid – that they’re not a boy or a girl and they can choose whichever gender they want."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2017/sep/08/glenna-hodge/mostly-false-austin-children-taught-gender-fluid-s/	A supporter of basing student access to bathrooms and locker rooms on gender identity at birth declared that as things stand, Austin's schools teach children to choose their genders. Spicewood attorney Glenna Hodge, testifying before the Texas Senate State Affairs Committee, said parents should recognize that without a protective law, their children can’t count on privacy. Hodge went on: "We also know that schools in Austin Independent School District are teaching children as young as 4 years old that their gender is fluid–that they’re not a boy or a girl and they can choose whichever gender they want." Asked for examples of schools doing so, Hodge told the panel in July 2017 that Austin’s Kiker and Odom elementary schools trained teachers with "Welcoming Schools" materials devised by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. That campaign says it focuses on achieving equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. In each training, Hodge testified, teachers were told to tell children that gender identity is fluid. We asked Hodge how she reached her conclusion about what students are taught. By phone, she said 24 of the Austin district’s 85 elementary schools undertook the training, which she described as clearing the way for students to be taught gender-fluid lessons. "What are the teachers supposed to do with the training? What’s the point if not to affirm transgenderism?" Hodge said. A 2017 web post Hodge pointed us to a January 2017 web post by the Southern Baptist Texan, a religious publication. The post, "Trojan Horse: Austin ‘anti-bullying’ program pushes progressive views on gender, sexual identity," says the Welcoming Students material "is taught to students as young as 4 years old" and "affirms same-sex marriage and parenting, gay and lesbian relationships, and transgenderism." In one module of the teacher training, the post says, "teachers are asked to answer questions about their preconceived ideas about gender (i.e. gender bias). The lesson states, ‘By embracing the richness of the gender spectrum, teachers and other adults can help broaden children’s understandings of gender in order to help every child feel seen and recognized.’" The post goes on: "By Module 5, children are told they can choose their gender identity even if that identity conflicts with biological reality. Questioning the child’s choice of gender is not an option for teachers or students," the post says. A teacher’s recollection Hodge also put us in touch with Caryl Ayala, who described herself by phone as a former Odom pre-kindergarten teacher where, she said, the Welcoming Schools training took place in 2015-16. She said she had no recording or notes taken during the training but pointed us to a Concerned Parents of Austin website presenting what appeared to be part of the training presentation. According to one training module, "What is Gender?," presenters were to get teachers to "recognize that gender expression is a social construct, without meaning other than the meaning we have given it." School district responses Seeking a full grasp on what teachers were taught and what students are told, we queried the Austin district. By email, a spokeswoman, Tiffany Young, initially conveyed a statement from Peter Price, district director of social and emotional learning, stating that in the 2014-15 through 2016-17 school years, 24 elementary campuses requested and received Welcoming Schools "professional development," which Price described as a "training for teachers to provide safe, supportive, inclusive environments for students and their families and to create a conversation among adults on campus to examine our language and practices." In each instance, Price, said, a letter was sent home at the start of the school year and parents were invited to attend a module. Young emailed us an undated letter to parents stating the training focuses on embracing family diversity, ending bullying and avoiding "gender stereotyping and accepting diverse gender identities." From the parent letter: "Pressure to conform to specific gender roles can limit a child’s development by limiting experiences and expectations. We believe it is important to allow all students to reach their full potential and to feel safe expressing their individuality." So, are students taught that gender is fluid? In a follow-up statement, Price said "one of the biggest misconceptions about our Welcoming Schools training for teachers is that they turn around after the training and present a curriculum/lessons to students about LGTBQ topics. That does not happen. The training is for adults, so they can be better prepared to welcome all students to our schools and to ensure all students feel safe and valued. There is no curriculum or lessons for the students." We later connected with Lisa Goodnow, the district’s executive director for academic and social emotional learning, who said by phone that children in pre-kindergarten are taught about health and safety issues, not gender identity. Human sexuality gets taken up in middle and high school, Goodnow said. Goodnow emailed us a document showing topics addressed in the district’s human sexuality curriculum from kindergarten through fifth grade. Human sexuality gets mentioned in third grade, the document says, with puberty discussed in fifth grade; there’s no direct mention of gender identity in the document. When we asked Young about Austin schools doing the Welcoming Schools training in 2017-18, she replied that no schools were doing so but the district was "looking into creating its own training program in the future for teachers and is taking the next year to develop it." Documentation At our inquiry, the district also gave access to hundreds of pages of emails and other documents from recent years about the Welcoming Schools trainings and gender-related topics. We didn’t spot material suggesting teachers were telling students that gender is fluid. But documents did show interest among teachers and other staff in helping students come to terms with gender identity issues. Among the documents: --A 2015 paper, "Beyond the Gender Binary: A Group for Teens," suggesting middle and high schools could provide opportunities for students to explore "the many facets of gender identity and increase feelings of well-being in trans youth." --A 2015 email from Superintendent Paul Cruz to principals and staff sharing changes in policy adopted by the school board to protect gender identity and expression. The email said: "Gender identity refers to a person’s innate, deeply felt psychological identification as male, female or another gender. Gender expression refers to the external manifestation of a person’s gender identity, which or may not conform to socially defined behaviors and characteristics typically associated with being either masculine or feminine." Cruz’s email further said he hoped to see the Welcoming Schools curriculum extended to all campuses. --A 2016 email from a district official to another sharing a CNN story on what it means to be "gender-fluid." --A Welcoming Schools packet about using books in grades one through three to look at gender stereotyping. --A list of "gender identity" books for students including picture books for students starting in pre-k. "Adventures of Tulip, Birthday Wish Fairy," the list says, follows Tulip "as he deals with the birthday wishes of all the nine-year-olds in North America. Tulip receives a wish from a child known as David to live as Daniela. He doesn’t know how to help, so he seeks the wise counsel of the Wish Fairy Captain." Another listed book: "All I Want to Be is Me," is described as giving voice "to the feelings of children who don’t fit gender stereotypes, and who just want to be free to be themselves. Includes children who are fluid in their gender identity, as well as those that feel their body doesn’t match who they really are," the summary says. Human Rights Campaign We also heard back from the Human Rights Campaign about its training materials. By email, spokeswoman Sarah McBride provided responses from Johanna Eager, director of Welcoming Schools, who said: "We do not say that gender is a choice, but in workshops with educators, Welcoming Schools does reference the research and data which demonstrate that children begin to understand their gender identity as early as the age of four." We looked over the foundation’s suggested Welcoming Schools lesson plans, noticing that none focus on children in pre-kindergarten and the lesson plan on "understanding transgender children" contains no language saying children should be told gender identity is fluid though there’s reference to gender as a spectrum. That particular lesson plan, intended for teachers in kindergarten through fifth grade, lists among goals the expansion of "students’ perception and understanding of gender" and also understanding "what it means to be transgender using developmentally appropriate language for younger students." The plan also calls for students to read and discuss a nonfiction story, "I Am Jazz," and it says students "will learn new vocabulary words related to gender." From the publisher’s summary of the story: "From the time she was two years old, Jazz knew that she had a girl's brain in a boy's body. She loved pink and dressing up as a mermaid and didn't feel like herself in boys' clothing. This confused her family, until they took her to a doctor who said that Jazz was transgender and that she was born that way. Jazz's story is based on her real-life experience and she tells it in a simple, clear way that will be appreciated by picture book readers, their parents, and teachers." The lesson plan says teachers should understand before reading the book to students "that gender is a spectrum, not a binary, and that we all express ourselves in many different ways along that spectrum. Each child is an individual with their own unique expression of who they are in the world," the plan says. Definitions offered with the lesson plan include: "GENDER IDENTITY: How you feel — male, female, neither or both. This can be different from the anatomy that you were born with (sex assigned at birth)." "TRANSGENDER/TRANS: When your gender identity (how you feel) is different than how your body is (your anatomy). When a person with a boy body feels like a girl inside their heart and brain. Or, when a person with a girl body feels like a boy inside their heart and brain. " "GENDER BINARY: The idea that there are two distinct and opposite genders — male and female / boy and girl. This idea is limiting and doesn’t allow for the many ways that children and adults express themselves." We followed up with Young, who noted by email that the Austin district didn’t adopt the Welcoming Schools curriculum for classroom instruction. Further, she said: "We are not aware of any elementary school teachers who are teaching gender fluidity." Our ruling Hodge said: "Schools in Austin Independent School District are teaching children as young as 4 years old that their gender is fluid – that they’re not a boy or a girl and they can choose whichever gender they want." Hodge didn’t deliver proof of Austin students including toddlers getting told that gender is fluid nor did we confirm such instruction. It’s clear otherwise that the district has put energy into teachers understanding that each child comes to terms with gender identity among developmental issues. Teacher training materials include a lesson plan describing gender identity varying along a spectrum. We rate this claim Mostly False.

President Barack Obama plans to transfer the approximately 230 remaining detainees to other countries or to prisons in the United States. Responding to the Republicans, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters on June 16, 2009, that it's important to consider Obama's plans in context with the overall number of releases in the past seven years. "Some 500 detainees were released from Guantanamo during the Bush administration," Hoyer said. We wondered if he was correct. Indeed, government documents indicate more than 500 detainees were released or transferred from Guantanamo while George W. Bush was president. A White House executive order issued on the second day of Obama's presidency said, " The federal government has moved more than 500 such detainees from Guantánamo, either by returning them to their home country or by releasing or transferring them to a third country." That's backed up by a fact sheet from the military task force that runs the detention camp, which says 520 detainees had been released or transferred by March 2009. Our only quibble with Hoyer is his use of the word "released." That could be interpreted to mean that under Bush, 500-plus detainees left the center and were immediately freed. But the Pentagon says there is a difference between a release and a transfer to another country. The vast majority of detainees leave Gitmo under a transfer, which means they are transported to another country that places them under some type of restrictions. Some are incarcerated in those countries because of criminal charges, while others face monitoring or travel limitations. But Hoyer only said "released," so we'll take him down a notch to Mostly True.	None	Steny Hoyer	None	None	None	2009-06-18T18:12:38	2009-06-16	['George_W._Bush', 'Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp']
pomt-02153	"Wendy Davis has already taken more $ from teacher unions than the past 3 Democrat gubernatorial candidates combined."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/may/02/republican-party-texas/early-campaign-wendy-davis-has-not-raised-more-thr/	Teacher groups often back Democrats for office; it shouldn’t be a surprise Wendy Davis has such support. Still, a reader asked us to check an April 11, 2014, tweet from @WendyDavisTruth, a Twitter account run by the Republican Party of Texas. The tweet said, "Wendy Davis has already taken more $ from teacher unions than the past 3 Democrat gubernatorial candidates combined." The tweet came with a bar chart comparing contributions by three teacher groups — the Texas State Teachers Association, Texas chapter of the American Federation of Teachers and the political arm of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association. The bar labeled "2014 Wendy Davis" far exceeded comparable bars for Tony Sanchez’s 2002 gubernatorial run, Chris Bell’s 2006 campaign and Bill White’s 2010 campaign. Here’s the chart: By the group’s math, Davis has drawn $102,777 from the three teacher groups, while the previous three Democratic nominees for governor combined to attract $102,700. Republican Party of Texa administrator Beth Cubriel told us by email the figures were based on contribution and expenditure reports filed at the Texas Ethics Commission. She added that the figures reflect all contributions by the teacher groups to the candidates — not just contributions made while each one was running for governor. But labels on the chart — "2006 Bell" and "2014 Wendy Davis," for example — left us with a different impression. One might not expect that previous campaigns for other offices would be included in those contribution totals. We looked next at how much each candidate drew from the singled-out groups while running for governor. By our calculations, Davis garnered about $67,000 of her contributions from the groups for her two tightly-contested Senate campaigns with about $36,000 coming in since she declared for governor Oct. 3, 2013. Likewise, Bell in 2006 drew no donations from the groups during his run for governor; his nearly $40,000 came during his 2008 campaign for a Texas Senate seat. By contrast, the teacher contributions to Sanchez in 2002 and White in 2010 were specifically for gubernatorial campaigns. By email, Cubriel said our breakdown succinctly covers "what didn't fit into the four corners" of the party's chart. The party "never claimed the money was given to her gov(ernor) campaign directly," she said. "The years on the chart are to serve as a reminder of when each candidate was the nominee." We told Cubriel that our review of campaign-finance reports turned up a sizable contribution not included in the party’s critique--$125,000 gained by Davis’s gubernatorial kitty on Jan. 15, 2014, from the Washington, D.C.-based American Federation of Teachers Committee on Political Education. Cubriel said by phone that party researchers didn’t search records for that group. "That makes the case against her even worse," she said. Our ruling The Texas party said Davis has already taken more money from "teacher unions," meaning three teacher groups, than the previous three Democratic gubernatorial candidates combined and presented a chart purporting to show that. The tweet and chart turned out to mislead. Most of the cited teacher groups’ giving to Davis came during her campaigns for state Senate, not during her run for governor. Running for governor, Davis has attracted about $36,000 from two of the groups and nothing from the third. That total trails the $65,000 combined raised by two of the previous nominees in their respective gubernatorial bids. Regardless, the claim has an element of truth. With career fund-raising factored in, Davis has topped the three previous Democratic gubernatorial nominees in support from the groups. Moreover, the party didn't mention a 2014 donation of $125,000 to Davis's campaign from a major teacher group. We rate this claim as Mostly False.

The Treasurer accurately points to a widening gap between Australia's company tax rate and that of many other countries. Where there has been a global trend to lower company taxes, Australia has not reduced company tax for most businesses since 2000. Australia's company tax rate (30 per cent for most businesses) already compares unfavourably with that of Singapore (17 per cent) and the United Kingdom (19 per cent). And while the United States currently has a higher company tax rate than Australia (35 per cent or over 39 per cent if state taxes are included), the Republican administration is pushing to reduce that rate to 20 per cent. While Australian resident shareholders may see little direct benefit from company tax cuts due to Australia's imputation tax credit system, it is clear that many foreign investors compare company tax rates when deciding where to invest. But it is not the only factor influencing investment. And even if the Labor Party caves in and agrees to the Government's company tax proposals, this would only result in a reduction over time to 25 per cent. Australia would continue to compare unfavourably to Singapore, the UK (which is scheduled to reduce its rate to 17 per cent over the same period) and possibly the United States.

pomt-06893	"Thirty-four of the last 44 (debt ceiling increases) have been for less than a year. So, this notion that short-term is somehow the exception, it's actually the rule."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/27/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-most-debt-ceiling-increases-h/	Just cut spending. No, raise taxes on the rich, too. What if we reform the whole tax code? Fine, but don’t spook the financial markets, and don’t make us perform this dance again next year. So many options, so little agreement. Welcome to July 2011, when ordinary Americans are following the shots and fouls of the federal debt as if this were Sweet 16 college basketball brackets. The debt is a problem, but failure to raise the amount the government can legally borrow could be worse, many say. What can be done about it? President Barack Obama, House Speaker John Boehner and other congressional leaders are trying to hash this out while the government can still pay all its bills. One of their disagreements is how high to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, and how much spending should be cut to correspond with that hike. Some Republicans want a debt hike that is a short-term solution for now, matched with spending cuts, while working on more sweeping spending reforms over the next year. The White House hoped for something grander, saying it doesn’t want to just punt the problem into an election year. Others want to pair spending compromises with tax reform, but that would require a short-term solution to get past the looming crisis now and a return to the table later with long-sought tax reform. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman is among those advocates. Right now, "we simply don’t have time to deal with these bigger issues like tax reform," Portman said to MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell on July 25, 2011. "And by the way, if you look back, historically, you know usually the debt limit is for less than a year," he added. "Thirty-four of the last 44 (debt hikes) have been for less than a year. So, this notion that short-term is somehow the exception, it's actually the rule." Portman, a Republican who was director of the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush, intrigued PolitiFact Ohio with his answer, because he was suggesting that this nation has done an awful lot of punting on the debt ceiling. So we asked his office where he got his information. Spokeswoman Christine Mangi referred us to a July 24 blog post by Keith Hennessey, who maintains a website called "Your Guide to American Economic Policy." Hennessey is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank at Stanford University, and a lecturer at Stanford’s graduate business and law schools. Hennessey also has extensive policy experience as an economic adviser to President George W. Bush and on Capitol Hill. We turned to Hennessey’s blog and to his backup data. We won’t bore you with details, but we spotted an error in the data presentation as it related to a certain time period. We contacted Hennessey by phone and e-mail and he graciously acknowledged the error and corrected his website. He noted in a return e-mail that it didn’t change his broader point. He was right. We know because he shared his data with us and told us of the original source, namely, historical tables on the federal debt since 1940. These are maintained by the White House Office of Management and Budget -- Portman’s old outfit -- and we keep sets of these budget documents in our office because you never know when you’ll need them. We took them off the shelf and confirmed Hennessey’s trend line. That is, of the 44 most recent times that the debt limit has been raised, going back to 1980, Congress and the president have had to come back within a year on 34 occasions and raise it again. Wars, recessions, excessive spending, inadequate revenues, unbalanced budgets -- stuff has happened. Hennessey picked the number 44 because it represents the last 30 years of debt hikes. "You could argue things are different now – it’s more difficult for Congress to act, and the spending and deficit problems we face combine with legislative uncertainty around the debt limit deadline to create undesirable financial market pressures," Hennessey wrote in his blog. But he added, "A debt limit extension of three, six, or nine months would be routine based on historic practice." That’s what Portman said, too -- that 34 of the last 44 have lasted for less than a year. Portman’s statement was accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter it rates True.

pomt-12542	In America, "more people die from" prescription narcotic painkillers "than from heroin and cocaine combined."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/19/brad-schimel/which-deadlier-prescription-painkillers-heroin-or-/	The explosion of deaths from heroin and other opioid drugs promises to be an issue in the 2018 elections, in Wisconsin and across the nation. As Wisconsin’s top cop, Attorney General Brad Schimel has promised aggressive efforts to continue to push back against the tide. In a March 12, 2017, interview on WFRV-TV in Green Bay, Schimel, who is seeking re-election, said the overdose spike "did get ahead of us." His explanation: prescription painkiller abuse has soared, leading in turn to greater use of heroin from Mexico, Central America and South America. Another factor: the rise of fentanyl, an often illegally produced and sold painkiller of super high potency. "In America," Schimel added, "more people die from the painkillers than from heroin and cocaine combined." Is he right? Digging into the numbers To back Schimel’s claim, his office provided a 2011 news release from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that quoted 2008 figures on prescription painkiller use, abuse and related deaths. "Overdoses involving prescription painkillers are at epidemic levels and now kill more Americans than heroin and cocaine combined," the release quoted CDC Director Thomas Frieden as saying. On the surface, it’s compelling -- if very dated -- evidence for Schimel’s claim. But a deeper dive, and a look at more recent trends, tells a somewhat different story. In 2008, heroin deaths were just starting to take off, and illegally made and distributed knockoffs of prescription fentanyl were not yet a huge story. At that time, the number of deaths involving prescription painkillers greatly exceeded those involving heroin and cocaine. But when Schimel spoke, much more recent figures were available. In 2015, the CDC estimated that heroin and cocaine deaths were more than double the 2008 total, largely due to spiking heroin use. By contrast, prescription opioid-involved deaths had risen but not as fast. Let’s do the 2015 math on Schimel’s equation: there were 12,998 heroin-related deaths and 6,784 deaths involving cocaine, per the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Total: 19,782. Meanwhile, a spokesman at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics offered this total for prescription painkiller deaths: 17,536. So by the agency’s own math, based on its widely publicized number, Schimel’s claim doesn’t hold up. But -- stay with us -- that doesn’t leave the attorney general without a leg to stand on. Other creditable health-care organizations and federal agencies say there were 22,598 deaths involving one or more prescription opioid painkillers -- a figure that would make Schimel’s claim accurate. And those organizations are citing numbers published by the CDC. How can that be? Changing definitions The confusion is over an adjustment the CDC made regarding fentanyl, the synthetic painkiller that is sold both as a prescription medicine and as an illegally produced street drug used to intensify the high of other drugs such as heroin. In 2016, the CDC decided to narrow what it considers "prescription" opioids because law enforcement reports suggested many of the deaths involving fentanyl were from the non-prescription street version of the drug. So the agency removed some or all synthetic opioids from the "prescription" death tally, saying it’s a better way to portray what’s really happening. It’s not a perfect fix -- it excludes deaths associated with prescription fentanyl, for example. That brings the number down from 22,598 to 17,536 or even lower -- and is the difference between Schimel’s claim being on or off target. Clearly the CDC prefers the lower number and emphasizes it in its public presentation, but the higher figure, or both, are cited by others. The rating Schimel said that in America, "more people die from" prescription narcotic painkillers "than from heroin and cocaine combined." His claim would go unchallenged if this were 2008, the year upon which his claim is based. But changing drug trends and a 2016 alteration in how federal officials tally deaths creates problems for his math. Still, there’s a case to be made for his number based on a long-used but recently de-emphasized way of calculating deaths from prescription drugs. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-01836	Says Charlie Crist "voted against raising the minimum wage."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/17/republican-party-florida/charlie-crist-voted-against-minimum-wage-hike-flor/	The Republican Party of Florida was quick to assail Charlie Crist’s first gubernatorial campaign commercial, claiming that while Crist says he supports a higher minimum wage, that hasn’t always been the case. "Crist voted against raising the minimum wage," the GOP said in a July 8 ad. With President Barack Obama pushing to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10, the issue has become a campaign plank for Crist. The new Democrat has famously said he’s lived "paycheck to paycheck" his whole life, so we were curious if and when he may have voted against a wage hike. Passing the buck Crist has spent years in Florida politics holding a number of elected positions, which he recalled when PolitiFact Florida asked the former Republican what he had to say about the GOP’s allegation about his voting record. "I haven't taken a vote since 1998," Crist told us, referring to his last legislative session as a state senator before a failed run for U.S. Senate. "This is a campaign about the future. While the economy is improving I have come to the conclusion that the minimum wage we have now is not sufficient." But the Republican Party of Florida told us they were referring to 2004, when he was attorney general. That year, Florida voters were being asked to decide on a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour. As attorney general, Crist had no say in whether the popular measure passed or not. It ended up passing, raising Florida’s minimum wage and tying it to inflation. This year it went up 14 cents an hour and is now $7.93. In 2006, the Tampa Bay Times profiled Crist as he ran for governor. The article said that as a board member of the state’s public-private economic development agency Enterprise Florida, Crist was part of an Aug. 19, 2004, teleconference in which the organization voted unanimously to oppose the minimum wage increase. The vote was a statement of principle that business leaders did not endorse the wage hike. We asked Enterprise Florida about the vote. Spokesman Sean Helton checked the meeting minutes and found that yes, the board did take a voice vote on the proposal and unanimously opposed it. Then-Attorney General Charlie Crist was present at the meeting. We asked Crist’s campaign to comment on whether Crist had voted against the proposal. They didn’t comment on the Enterprise Florida vote. The Crist campaign referred us back to coverage from 2006, when the Times asked Crist in 2006 while running for governor how he felt about the minimum wage increase of 2004. "I don't think I had a problem with it," Crist said then. There is scant mention of Crist’s stance on the issue beyond that. It wasn’t a part of his 2006 gubernatorial run, and he hasn’t discussed it until this year’s election, when he made it a part of his campaign promises. Gov. Rick Scott has often couched his lukewarm discussions about the wage as a potential detriment to businesses. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said, "Crist voted against raising the minimum wage." We should note that the vote in question was not the kind of vote people would usually think of when it comes to the minimum wage. Crist has never voted on legislation about the minimum wage in any official capacity. But Crist was at a 2004 meeting of a business advocacy group, and there was a unanimous voice vote expressing the organization’s opinion against raising the minimum wage. Crist was at the meeting, but none of the votes were recorded. Other than that, we can’t find any evidence of Crist publicly opposing or supporting minimum wage increases, until his recent campaign.

pomt-13018	In Wisconsin, "300,000 voters were turned away by the state’s strict voter ID law" in the 2016 presidential election.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/07/tweets/were-300000-wisconsin-voters-turned-away-polls-201/	It’s widely expected that after a recount of 3 million ballots under way in Wisconsin, Donald Trump will still have won the state. But what if 300,000 more Wisconsinites had voted in the presidential election? That number is 11 times higher than Trump’s 22,000-vote margin over Hillary Clinton, based on the original counts. The specter of a different result was raised widely on Twitter beginning Nov. 9, 2016, the day after the election. It came with this claim (which used a vote-margin figure that had been quoted in some news reports): Trump won Wisconsin by 27,000 votes. 300,000 voters were turned away by the state’s strict Voter ID law. There is your "rigged" election. By Dec. 6, 2016 -- midway through the $3.5 million recount, paid for by the campaign of Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein -- the tweet was still being retweeted. (Stein, by the way, earned a Pants on Fire for her claim that Wisconsin uses outlawed voting machines.) There’s no evidence that 300,000 Wisconsin voters were turned away from the polling places because they didn’t have photo identification. But it’s worth noting, with the emergence of fake news, that the figure isn’t pulled out of thin air. The law, and lawsuits In 2011, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature adopted and GOP Gov. Scott Walker signed a law requiring residents to show a photo identification in order to vote. A drivers license, state ID card, passport and other forms of ID were among those that would meet the law. Voters could request a free state ID for voting from the state Department of Motor Vehicles. (Wisconsin is one of seven states with a so-called strict photo ID law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Eight other states have a photo ID law that’s labeled as non-strict.) The same year, and again in 2012, various groups filed lawsuits. After a two-week trial, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman in 2014 struck down the law. The Milwaukee judge said the requirement that voters show photo IDs at the polls established an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote and violated the federal Voting Rights Act because its effects hit Latinos and African-Americans harder than whites. As part of his ruling, Adelman determined that about 300,000 registered voters in Wisconsin -- about 9 percent of all registered voters -- lacked the type of identification needed for voting. He said his finding was based primarily on expert testimony from Leland Beatty, a statistical marketing consultant in Texas who was hired by the plaintiffs. Beatty, the judge wrote, estimated the number of registered voters who did not have a drivers license or state ID card. After more litigation, the law was eventually reinstated in 2015. 2016 election So, how many people were turned away in the 2016 presidential election for lack of photo ID? In Wisconsin, according to the state Elections Commission, there were 2,975,313 votes cast for president in 2016 (prior to the recount), down 93,121 votes or 3 percent from 2012. The Milwaukee election director said the drop of 41,000 included "some of the greatest declines" in areas "we projected would have the most trouble with voter ID requirements." He also acknowledged, however, that some of the drop-off had to do with the candidates and less enthusiasm for the candidates. But no statistics are kept on the number of people who were turned away at polling locations on election day for lack of photo ID. In any case, it’s almost certain the figure is not 300,000. Adelman himself noted that although he found the voter ID law would "deter or prevent a substantial number" of the 300,000 from voting, "a more precise measurement is impracticable. There is no way to determine exactly how many people (the law) will prevent or deter from voting without considering the individual circumstances of each of the 300,000 plus citizens who lack an ID." Political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us: "There is no evidence that 300,000 people were turned away in the November 2016 election. We will never know the precise impact of the voter ID law on turnout. It is almost certainly not true that all 300,000 or so people who are registered but lack ID tried to vote this year." Simply put, while it’s likely that some voters were turned away at the polls, others no doubt obtained a photo ID and cast their ballots. Snopes.com, which in its fact check of this statement issued a rating of "unproven," concluded that "even if the 300,000 figure was an accurate estimate of Wisconsin residents who back in 2014 possibly could not vote because they did not have the correct identification, that number was not a head count of residents who actually did or would have set out to vote on Nov. 8, 2016, only to be turned away." After that fact check, the originator of the tweet wrote a blog post acknowledging there isn’t evidence to back up the claim. Our rating Tens of thousands of times, Twitter users repeated this statement: In Wisconsin, "300,000 voters were turned away by the state’s strict voter ID law" in the 2016 presidential election. A federal judge in 2014 determined in a civil rights lawsuit that some 300,000 registered voters in Wisconsin lack the photo identification necessary to comply with Wisconsin’s voter ID law. But there is no evidence that anywhere near that number of people were turned away from the polls in the 2016 presidential election for lack of a proper photo ID.

pomt-12885	"One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal — the Under2 MOU — has 165 signatories, representing a billion people."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/26/jerry-brown/heres-what-you-need-know-about-californias-paris-a/	California Gov. Jerry Brown offered an energetic rebuke to the Trump administration’s "alternative facts" and "blatant attacks on science" in his State of the State address. The solidly blue state voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, prompting Brown to reflect on California’s place in a broader national context in a speech traditionally used to set a state policy agenda. Contrasting Trump’s positions, Brown promised to oppose deportations of undocumented immigrants, to protect health care and to continue to act on climate change. "One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal — the Under2 MOU — has 165 signatories, representing a billion people," Brown said. "We can do much on our own and we can join with others – other states and provinces and even countries, to stop the dangerous rise in climate pollution. And make no mistake, we are going to do exactly that." We wanted to know more about what Brown was talking about and if it is accurate. The Under2 MOU, or Subnational Global Climate Leadership Memorandum of Understanding, is a pact spearheaded by California and the German state of Baden-Württemberg in the leadup to the Paris agreement in 2015. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a "game changer." Its 165 members represent about 1 billion people and pledge to limit carbon emissions to below 80 to 90 percent from 1990 levels with the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100. That’s the same goal and framework of the Paris agreement, the major international deal between nearly 200 nations. But there are a few differences between the two deals. First, Brown’s numbers need explanation. Of the Under2 MOU’s 165 members, 155 are signatories, meaning they've declared their commitment to limit emissions and to provide action plans. The other 10 are countries that have endorsed the MOU, meaning they support the goal but don’t have to submit plans. Second, the MOU is voluntary and nonbinding, and while the Paris deal is also voluntary, it includes binding obligations on reporting emissions and progress. Third, unlike the MOU, the Paris agreement has increasingly stringent targets for signatories. The United States, for example, pledged to cut emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and then 26 to 28 percent percent by 2025 (equivalent to 19 to 24 percent from 1990 levels). Despite these differences, experts we spoke with said the Under2 MOU was a strong and forceful compact. But they said the MOU was a complement to the Paris agreement rather than its equivalent in terms of potential impact. "They’re part and parcel to each other. If you’re driving those kind of reductions, those can help you get to the national targets. They’re not distinct realms. They’re nested within each other," said Brendan Guy, the international policy manager at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Under the MOU, California pledged to reduce emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and actually enacted legislation that codifies the target and sets a regulatory process in place. That’s a "really high watermark" that hardly any national governments have met, said Danny Cullenward, an energy economist at Carnegie Institute for Science. Experts also pointed to California’s five-year-old cap-and-trade program (which the Obama administration tried but failed to implement on a national scale), extended renewable portfolio standards and its pledge to get 1.5 million zero emissions cars on the road by 2025 as examples of strong climate change action. Just how far-reaching are these targets and policies? To state the obvious, cities and states do not account for all of a country’s emissions, so their reduction pledges will not have an equivalent impact to a national commitment. California, despite being the largest state and equivalent to the world’s sixth-largest economy, accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the United States’ emissions. The other nine U.S. states that are part of the MOU (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington) represent another 10 percent of the country’s total emissions. Looking at it another way, if all 23,458 cities from the Energy Department's city energy profile tool enacted best energy-saving practices, it would lead to a 3 to 7 percent reduction in emissions, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. "Will these subnational efforts be enough to prevent a dangerous increase in average global temperature? Probably not," said Rachel Krause, a University of Kansas professor who focuses on local policy and sustainability. "But they still can have meaningful impact." Cullenward pointed out that the Paris agreement’s depth is the result of two decades of negotiations, while the MOU is a relatively new compact and will likely become much more sophisticated over time. "It’s no substitute for eventual national action. But it’s a really appropriate strategy where you have national governments that aren’t interested in taking action on climate change," he said. Our ruling Brown said, "194 countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal — the Under2 MOU — has 165 signatories, representing a billion people." The Under2 MOU, spearheaded by California and the Germany state Baden-Württemberg, is a climate change agreement signed by 155 cities and states that have pledged reductions in carbon emissions and endorsed by 10 countries. While its emissions impact is not as far-reaching as the Paris agreement, experts told us it is a very similar deal that fosters international cooperation on climate change and fills a void in times of national hesitation to act.

One claim in the ad, which appears online and also filled a page in the April 24, 2013, Austin American-Statesman, was especially familiar--and flawed. "Now Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states," the ad said when we looked. A few days earlier, we rated as Mostly True a similar claim by state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, who like the school boards’ group depended on preliminary spending estimates calculated by the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union. In February 2012, the association said that Texas schools are spending $8,400 per student this year on items such as salaries for school personnel, student transportation, school books and energy. Its breakdown suggests Texas’ per-student expenditures trailed such spending in every state but two. Those calculations place Texas 48th among the states in per-student spending. And how might someone conclude, like the school boards’ association, that Texas ranks 49th? The compiled figures, shown on Summary Table K in the association’s report, downloadable here, reflect spending within each state plus schools in the District of Columbia, which has current estimated expenditures of more than $14,000 per student. Consequently, the Texas spending level falls 49th among the 50 states plus D.C. By phone, Catherine Clark, associate executive director of the school boards’ association, confirmed that the group relied on the NEA calculations in declaring Texas as 49th in education spending among the states. If spending in the D.C. schools figures into that conclusion, Clark said, "then we’re wrong." Our ruling The group said Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states. Texas ranks 48th among the states, according to preliminary figures, and 49th only if one also considers spending in the schools in Washington, D.C., which is not a state.

He's taking jobs from African Americans and giving them to his friends."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/feb/04/farouk-shami/farouk-shami-says-bill-white-discriminating-taking/	Farouk Shami of Houston, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, recently made a pointed charge about his key Democratic opponent, according to an online post by the Dallas Morning News. Referring to former Houston Mayor Bill White, Shami said Jan. 26: "He is discriminating. He’s taking jobs from African-Americans and giving them to his friends." Such an assertion could pack a wallop in the Democratic primary, where African Americans are traditionally a vital voting bloc. We tried to get the goods on Shami's provocative claim — starting with our confusion over Shami's speaking as if White, who is no longer Houston's mayor, could currently be handing out city jobs while stumping for governor. Shami spokeswoman Kelly Johnson told us that Shami spoke in the present tense because that’s his typical speech pattern. She also pointed us to a nearly year-old Houston Chronicle article that quoted critics of the Houston city department that's responsible for ensuring that companies doing business with the city do all they can to subcontract with businesses helmed by women, minorities and the disadvantaged. In the Feb. 12 article, Houston City Councilman Jarvis Johnson said the 25-year-old the Minority Women Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, or MWDBE, program should improve or be scrapped. More criticism came from City Councilman Ron Green, who said the program to certify businesses as MWDBEs employed a process "to keep individuals from getting certified." The article also noted it is common practice among local governments to assist and promote the use of businesses owned by women, minorities and people with disabilities in city contracting efforts. White, whose tenure as mayor ran from 2004 through December, is quoted saying the certification process "can always be improved." He suggested the city create a simple system making it easier to determine if paperwork has sat too long on someone’s desk or whether a complaint is legitimate, the Chronicle reported. Velma Laws, director of the city’s Affirmative Action and Contract Compliance Department, recently told us it takes the department an average of 30 days to process an application for certification, compared to the 90 days required by federal authorities. Nothing in the article speaks directly to Shami’s claim that White discriminated, taking jobs from black residents to give to friends. We sought outside insights into how black-led firms fared on White's watch. Thomas Jones, an African American Houston CPA and member of the Across the Track political action committee, told us the city affirmative action contracting program is sometimes perceived as not pushing hard enough for the hiring of historically disadvantaged firms. "We’ve had a number of members complain about the lack of advocacy on the part of the department as opposed to being there to make sure you dot all your I’s and cross your T’s," Jones said. "It probably could be some(thing) more advocacy minded." Jones said, however, he didn't notice any dropoff in minority opportunities while White was mayor. Nor did Jones sense racial discrimination coming from White, whose top aides included black and Hispanic residents. "I’ve always found White to be pretty fair," Jones said. "I would never ever say that Bill White is even remotely a racist ... That's just not true." The chairman of a Houston group representing black-owned businesses told us that some African American professionals believe they did not have the contracting opportunities under White that they enjoyed under his predecessor as mayor, Lee Brown. Carroll Robinson, chairman of the Houston Citizens Chamber of Commerce, said that his group is going to study whether there's a legitimate basis for that concern. We took our own look at contracts under the affirmative action program when White was mayor compared to contracts under his immediate predecessors as mayor, Brown and Bob Lanier. Through the program, the dollar amount of contracts awarded to businesses helmed by minorities, women or the disadvantaged increased from $809,000 under Lanier to nearly $1.3 million under Brown to $1.45 million under White. But the share of contracts in city projects credited to black-owned businesses dropped on White's watch to 15.3 percent. Under Brown, 20.1 percent of contracts monitored by the program went to black-owned businesses; under Lanier, it was 21 percent. The share of contracts awarded to Hispanic-owned businesses rose from 33 percent under Lanier and Brown to 34.5 percent under White, while the share of contracts awarded to Asian-owned businesses went from 14 percent under Lanier to 18 percent under Brown to 15 percent under White. White campaign spokeswoman Katy Bacon pointed out that 10 percent of contracts monitored by the program hadn't been finalized by the time White left office. As each one is executed, she suggested, the share of contracts awarded within each racial category could change. White stressed that the affirmative action program statistics do not capture all contracts awarded to minority-owned firms, including some awarded in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. "We are very proud of our record," White said. Johnson of Shami's campaign told us that Shami’s statement in Dallas reflected "the way many African Americans, Hispanics, and other minorities in the city of Houston feel about Bill White's tenure as mayor. He hired as his top staffers Republicans close to indicted former U.S. House Majority leader Tom DeLay (R-Sugar Land) and helped alter city policy in such a way that promoted contracts being let in larger blocks, thus resulting in less minority contractors being hired directly by the city." Johnson singled out White’s February 2004 hiring of Ann Travis as the Mayor’s Director for Government Affairs. A city press release stated that Travis had worked for seven years as district director for Rep. DeLay. White also supplemented her city pay with money from his campaign kitty, the Chronicle has reported. Johnson said the Chronicle had printed multiple articles in 2004 and 2005 about White, his DeLay connection and hires beyond Travis. Our search of the Chronicle for 2004-05 came up empty. Under White, a smaller share of black-owned businesses got contracts through the city program devoted to fostering affirmative action. It may also be that White fed perceptions that he was trimming opportunities for black-owned businesses. But Shami's claim is an overreach, unsupported by even his own campaign's back-up evidence. We rate Shami's statement as Pants on Fire.	None	Farouk Shami	None	None	None	2010-02-04T14:38:13	2010-01-26	['African_American']

pomt-13809	"We have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/18/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-says-lowest-percentage-americans-are/	In his Republican National Convention speech in Cleveland, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., tied his signature issue -- curbing illegal immigration -- to the national employment picture. "The fact is, we don’t have enough jobs for the people who are here," Sessions said. "Doesn’t this help to explain why our wages have fallen and why we have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years? Our duty as elected officials is to get our people jobs first." We wondered whether he was right that "we have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years." Taken literally, the correct economic statistic to use for answering this question is the employment-to-population ratio, or EPOP for short. This divides the number of employed Americans by the total civilian noninstitutional population at least 16 years of age. By this measurement, Sessions isn’t correct. Here’s a chart of the statistic going back to 1948, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics: As you can see, the statistic was higher than its current rate through much of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. However, the chart shows a few other things worth noting. First, it indicates that since the end of the Great Recession, the employment-to-population ratio has been climbing, slowly but fairly steadily. After bottoming out at 58.2 percent in 2010 and 2011, the trend line has zigzagged upward. It currently stands at 59.6 percent, or 1.4 percentage points above its low point about five years ago. Second, Sessions has exaggerated the length of time since the previous low point. It was last as low as 58.2 percent in August 1983, which was 33 years ago. And the last time it was as low as its current level -- 59.6 percent -- in August 1984, or about 32 years ago. Both are shorter periods than the 40 years Sessions cited. We expect that Sessions was instead referring to a different statistic -- the labor force participation rate -- since that is a common talking point for Republicans. This takes the number of people either working or trying to work and divides it by the total civilian noninstitutional population age 16 and up. Currently, this number is 62.7 percent. It was last that low in February 1978, which is a bit over 38 years -- close to the 40 years Sessions referred to. Here’s the chart for that statistic: Economists say this measurement captures important aspects of the job market. When the civilian labor force participation rate is low, it’s a concern, because it means there are fewer working Americans to support non-working Americans. But it’s worth adding some context as well. As we’ve noted before, a notable factor in the decline of the labor-force participation rate is the aging of the Baby Boom generation. As more adults begin moving into retirement age, the percentage of Americans who work is bound to decline. When we last looked at this question in 2013, Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, told us he had estimated that the labor-force participation rate would have fallen in recent years on the basis of aging alone. Still, the recession undoubtedly exacerbated that decline. In a weak job market, some people who might otherwise want a job may return to school, become full-time parents or retire early. Our ruling Sessions said, "We have the lowest percentage of Americans actually holding a job in 40 years." Sessions has worded his statement inartfully. If you use the correct statistic for the way he phrased it, the length of time is somewhat exaggerated and it ignores a recent improvement over the past five years or so. But if you can look past his looseness with economic terminology, Sessions has a point. Using a related statistic, he’s on target, and the larger issue he’s addressing -- declining rates of work in the population -- is something economists worry about, though much of it has to do with the graying of America. We rate his statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a0bfd8a-22a2-4990-a333-bd531b0196e1	None	Jeff Sessions	None	None	None	2016-07-18T22:05:03	2016-07-18	['United_States']

pomt-04294	Says that Sherrod Brown is an "Obama rubber stamp" for "supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/01/josh-mandel/mandel-campaign-labels-sherrod-brown-obama-ru/	U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown took considerable heat for his position on cap-and-trade legislation. He voted against it in the Senate, which disappointed and even outraged some environmentalists. It was among the biggest issues on which Brown, Ohio's Democratic incumbent, split with President Barack Obama. That was why PolitiFact Ohio was surprised to hear a radio ad for Brown's Republican challenger, Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel. The ad blasts Brown for "supporting the job-killing cap-and-trade plan" and labels him an "Obama rubber stamp." We asked the Mandel campaign how that claim was supported, and we reviewed the background. Cap and trade legislation seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their cap are then allowed to sell their emission credits to other companies that need them. Supporters say the approach provides economic incentives to reduce pollution and innovate. Critics deride it as an energy tax and say it increases costs for everyone. The approach was originally employed to curb the pollutants that cause acid rain in the early 1990s. President George H.W. Bush championed it, with the support of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. In 2008, it was one of the few areas of common ground between Obama and his opponent, Sen. John McCain. Both acknowledged climate change and favored carbon caps. In June 2008, Brown joined Republicans in voting to block a bill which would have imposed a cap-and-trade system of credits for carbon dioxide emissions. He said he would have liked to support the bill, but he said the measure would place too high a cost on Ohio industry and threatened jobs. In spring 2009, after Obama had taken office, Brown proposed legislation to provide incentives for manufacturers to adopt green technologies, but said it "doesn't cause me at all to change any position from last year" opposing a cap-and-trade system. He voted shortly afterward to keep the fast-track budget reconciliation process open on an emissions bill, so that it would not face a filibuster, but said he still had significant concerns about the legislation. "I'm an environmentalist," he said. "I want cap and trade. I just want to make sure that the ratepayers in my state don't get socked hard. And that the manufacturing doesn't get crippled." Mandel's campaign cited that quote as a source for its assertion that "Brown was open to supporting a cap-and-trade proposal." But being open to support falls short of endorsement. Before cap-and-trade legislation stalled and then died in the Senate, the New York Times reported in October 2009 that "Brown has not been shy about embracing the cap-and-trade policy (but) he also has not endorsed the bill." Brown "has bluntly stated that unless the (carbon emissions bill's) authors agree to a variety of manufacturing and trade provisions, there is little possibility that the legislation will get anywhere near enough support to clear the Senate," the article said. "Clean energy legislation is not just about the environment, it's about creating jobs and revitalizing our nation's manufacturing basis," Brown said. "For a clean energy bill to be successful, it must also be a jobs bill that partners with the business community." In early 2011, with no legislation on the table, The Plain Dealer reported that Brown and the coal industry "both are trying in their own ways to stop President Barack Obama's administration from imposing rules this year on new or upgraded power plants and large factories that use coal because, both say, the rules would hurt Ohio manufacturers and consumers." What's the capper on the ad's claim? The Mandel ad labeled Brown "an Obama rubberstamp" for "supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan." We’ll leave the phrase "job-killing" to those who debate policy. As a statement of opinion, PolitiFact Ohio won’t rate it. Regardless, the statement is not accurate. Rather, it invokes the fear of a proposed system for limiting emissions that Congress could never agree on and to this day does not exist. Brown has expressed support for some form of emissions controls and has said that under the right conditions, he would support cap-and-trade legislation. But it’s also clear that he had reservations about the legislation that has been before the Senate. When the 2009 bill was pending, Brown never endorsed it. He "bluntly stated that unless the (carbon emissions bill's) authors agree to a variety of manufacturing and trade provisions, there is little possibility that the legislation will get anywhere near enough support to clear the Senate," according to The New York Times. That bill stalled in the Senate and died without a final vote. In 2008, prior to Obama becoming president, Brown joined Republicans and voted to block a bill that would have created a cap-and-trade system of credits for carbon dioxide emissions. That is far from being a rubber stamp on the issue. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim in the radio ad rates False.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-11-01T07:00:00	2012-10-31	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-12435	Say Lance Armstrong is dead.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2017/may/15/blog-posting/fake-news-bloggers-say-lance-armstrong-has-died/	A newsy-looking four-paragraph web post says Lance Armstrong has died. Don’t buy it. The post is fake and Armstrong is alive, he’s already indicated. "Ha, ha," Armstrong texted in response to an Austin American-Statesman reporter today. "Yeah, weird." The fake story claims Armstrong has died of stage 4 colon cancer. The news allegedly was announced on Facebook by Armstrong’s daughter, Anna. Armstrong, though, took to social media to debunk the post. As noted by news organizations including the American-Statesman, a May 12, 2017, video post on the one-time world-class bicyclist’s Instagram account shows Armstrong seated behind a car steering wheel and showing, on a phone, the announcement of his death by the fox-news24.com website, and then smiling and shaking his head back and forth, meaning "naw." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Before noon the same day, Armstrong tweeted out a web link to the video with this message: "The rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated." SOURCE: InstaGram post, Lance Armstrong, May 12, 2017 (screenshot May 15, 2017) As our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington noted in April 2017, the fox-news24.com site attempts to mimic Fox News, but has no connection to the cable news network. The fox-news24.com story's citation of Anna helps raise a red flag. Armstrong has no children who go by that name, at least according to a December 2016 Daily Mail news story about an Armstrong family Christmas card. Just before we completed this fact check, an Armstrong representative, Mark Higgins, answered our inquiry by email: "I can confirm that he is indeed alive."

pomt-01451	Mary "Burke’s record: 130,000 fewer jobs."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/03/republican-governors-association/republican-ad-blames-mary-burke-loss-130000-jobs/	In a TV ad that rips Democrat Mary Burke for copying parts of her economic plan, a key ally of Gov. Scott Walker couldn’t resist an extra jab on jobs. In the spot sponsored by the Republican Governors Association, which began running Sept. 23, 2014, the narrator points to Wisconsin job losses during the Great Recession. "The truth is Burke’s record is one of failure and job loss, with plagiarism to cover it up," the narrator says. "Don’t go backwards with Mary Burke." As the words are spoken, this message fills the screen: "Burke’s record: 130,000 fewer jobs." It’s a familiar figure to us -- and probably to most voters by now. On the campaign trail, Walker has repeatedly juxtaposed the 100,000-plus jobs added during his first term with the total job loss in the last term under his Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle, who left office after 2010. Burke served as commerce secretary under Doyle for about three years. In an earlier factcheck of a Walker claim that Doyle’s policies in his last term "saw the state lose more than 133,000 jobs," we found the number to be accurate -- Doyle’s second term saw a drop of 133,943 jobs. But the claim was far off on the blame game. As such, we rated the claim Mostly False. Economists agreed that Wisconsin’s economy was caught in the same economic crash that crippled the entire country. The recession was deeper and more severe than any single state’s policies, including those of Doyle. And, notably, Wisconsin actually fared somewhat better than the rest of the country. But there are even bigger problems with the RGA taking a figure for Doyle’s last term and applying it to Burke. Her time as head of Commerce spanned parts of both Doyle’s terms, and she only served for 10 months of the four-year term the RGA associates with the 130,000 job loss. Indeed, she wasn’t even around when the job losses started coming. Burke started in February 2005 and left in November 2007 -- shortly before the downturn. Nationally, the Great Recession began in December 2007, but Wisconsin didn’t see a decline in quarterly jobs figures until mid 2008. The state saw jobs turnaround in 2010, the last year Doyle was in office, and annual growth has continued under Walker. Burke’s time at Commerce So, what happened with jobs while Burke was at the helm of Commerce? Statistics show Wisconsin added between 43,500 and 59,100 private-sector positions during Burke’s time in state government, depending on which federal data source is analyzed. To be sure, a governor’s policies have limited impact on increases or decreases in jobs, given the many factors that drive a state’s economy. And, as we have noted previously, a Commerce secretary’s influence would be even smaller. But even if all that were set aside, and the RGA is right to attach all of Doyle’s second-term numbers to Burke, what about the other side of the coin? After all, she also served during Doyle’s first term. Shouldn’t those be included as well? The state gained 86,530 jobs in Doyle’s first term from 2003 through 2006, so when combined with the losses of the second term, the final score for Doyle’s eight years was a loss of 47,000 jobs. Not good. But also not 130,000. Our rating The Republican Governors Association said Mary Burke’s record is one of "130,000 fewer jobs." But that number corresponds to Doyle’s second term, not Burke’s time as head of Commerce -- a period that saw an increase. Even with the most charitable of possible interpretations, the number is wrong.

pomt-02684	"US: Change in Income, 2009-13. Top 1%: +31.4%. Bottom 99%: +0.4%."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/07/ian-bremmer/ian-bremmer-says-top-1-percent-saw-incomes-go-34-p/	President Barack Obama and his allies have increasingly focused on income inequality as a top policy challenge for 2014. A recent tweet by Ian Bremmer, a leading expert on the intersection between international relations and finance, seemed to provide some fuel for Obama’s concern. Bremmer is the president and founder of the Eurasia Group, an international research and consulting firm, as well as a global research professor at New York University. On Jan. 4, 2014, he tweeted, "US: Change in Income, 2009-13. Top 1%: +31.4%. Bottom 99%: +0.4%." We thought we’d take a closer look at Bremmer’s numbers. We struck paydirt when we looked at the most recent data compiled by Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California who has spent years studying inequality, most often with Thomas Piketty, a French economist. In his paper, Saez found that between 2009 and 2012, the top 1 percent’s incomes grew by 31.4 percent while the bottom 99 percent’s incomes grew by 0.4 percent -- the same numbers Bremer had tweeted. This means, according to Saez’s paper, that the top 1 percent "captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery." So Bremmer can point to solid sourcing for his claim. However, not everyone is enamored of the Piketty-Saez approach. Alan Reynolds, a scholar with the libertarian Cato Institute, has written that the Piketty-Saez methodology tends to exaggerate the earnings of the top 1 percent and underestimate the earnings of the bottom 99 percent. The Piketty-Saez method uses pre-tax income and includes realized capital gains. This effectively boosts the measured income of the richest Americans, since they earn a lot of capital gains and they pay a lot of taxes. Meanwhile, for the 99 percent, the Piketty-Saez method excludes transfer income -- that is, payments from the government to individuals, including such items as Social Security, unemployment insurance, Medicaid and food stamps. Reynolds estimated that such transfer payments accounted for more than 16 percent of personal income in 2009. Transfer payments, he wrote, totaled $2.3 trillion in 2012. Also, Reynolds argues that way the Piketty-Saez numbers are calculated makes them subject to short-term fluctuations based on taxes. He suggests that the prospect of higher taxes in 2013 may have led to a surge of bonuses and cashing out of investments that would be subject to capital gains taxes -- something that also happened in 1992 and 1986. If true, this tendency would magnify an otherwise minor error in how Bremmer phrased his tweet. Bremmer tweeted that the figures covered the period 2009 to 2013; in fact, the Saez data, covers 2009 to 2012. The 2013 data are not available yet -- but they could look different due to the timing issue. (Bremmer told PolitiFact that he'd meant to communicate that the data went from 2009 to the start of 2013, "but that could have been expressed more clearly.") In the meantime, one could easily produce a more nuanced narrative than the familiar rich-get-richer story. Consider this table published in the most recent Saez paper: Time period Average real growth in income Real income growth for top 1 percent Real income growth for bottom 99 percent Fraction of total growth (or loss) captured by top 1 percent Full period, 1993-2012 17.9 percent 86.1 percent 6.6 percent 68 percent Clinton Expansion, 1993-2000 31.5 percent 98.7 percent 20.3 percent 45 percent 2001 Recession, 2000-2002 -11.7 percent -30.8 percent -6.5 percent 57 percent (of losses) Bush Expansion, 2002-2007 16.1 percent 61.8 percent 6.8 percent 65 percent Great Recession 2007-2009 -17.4 percent -36.3 percent -11.6 percent 49 percent (of losses) Recovery, 2009-2012 6.0 percent 31.4 percent 0.4 percent 95 percent This table -- Saez’s own data -- shows that the top 1 percent saw its inflation-adjusted income drop by 36.3 percent during the great recession, then recover by only 31.4 percent. In other words, the top 1 percent actually had a net loss between 2007 and 2012 -- a more modest net loss than the one suffered by the bottom 99 percent, to be sure, but a decline that muddies the easy story line. Even a scholar who’s sympathetic to the Piketty-Saez approach acknowledges that it’s not the only way to look at the numbers. "If you want the distribution of market income produced by the economy and as reported for income taxes, the Piketty-Saez numbers are the right numbers," said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin. "But if you want to gauge the effect of government programs on the income distribution, especially for the poor or middle classes, the outcome is different and cannot be measured by Piketty-Saez number." Smeeding says that the degree of inequality is eased "a bit" once you take into account taxes and benefits. Still, he said, the top 1 percent still "gets a bigger share, just not as big" as the Piketty-Saez numbers show. Our ruling Bremmer tweeted that in the United States, the top 1 percent of earners saw their income increase by 31.4 percent between 2009 and 2013, compared to 0.4 percent for the bottom 99 percent. He took those numbers from the respected, long-running analysis of income inequality by Piketty and Saez, but this research is not the only way to look at the question. Taking into account taxes and transfer payments would reduce -- though likely not eliminate -- the difference in income gains between the 1 percent and the 99 percent. In addition, Bremmer acknowledged that his phrasing about the time frame for the data could have been clearer. His statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Ian Bremmer	None	None	None	2014-01-07T13:56:34	2014-01-04	['None']

The upper chamber needs 60 votes to prevent a Republican filibuster on the bill, and with Brown's election, Democrats have lost their supermajority. Vice President Joe Biden lamented this obstacle in a speech just days before Brown defeated Democratic Senate candidate Martha Coakley. "As long as I have served … I’ve never seen, as my uncle once said, the Constitution stood on its head as they’ve done," Biden said at a Florida fundraiser Jan. 17, 2010, according to a White House pool report. "This is the first time every single solitary decision has required 60 senators." We're going to check the second part of Biden's statement, that this is the first time in his political career that every decision in the Senate has required 60 votes. But first, some Senate history. Once upon a time, senators could stall debate indefinitely by reading from cookbooks or reciting Shakespeare (think Jimmy Stewart's impassioned speech in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). In 1917, new rules allowed Senate leadership to end debate so long as it had support from two-thirds of the Senate. In 1975, the Senate reduced that to three-fifths, or 60 of the current 100 senators. Around this time, the old-school filibuster started to become less popular. With only 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster, the majority party would simply file cloture motions -- the technical term to set up a vote to stop debate -- and get on with it, said Senate historian Don Ritchie. Of course, both the minority and the majority have benefited from the tactical tool. The minority can unify and oppose a cloture motion, effectively stalling a bill. And the majority, knowing it has no chance of winning on a vote, can file a cloture motion and then blame the opposition for holding things up. But back to Biden's statement. He won his Senate seat in 1973, just two years before the Senate adopted its new cloture rules, and served until Jan. 15, 2009, shortly before he was sworn in as vice president. The Senate historian's office provided us with a list of cloture votes since 1919, which have been on the uptick in the last three decades. The 110th Congress, which spanned from 2006 to 2008, boasts the most with 112 votes. There were 54 such votes from 2004 to 2006, and 49 vote from 2002 to 2004. There have been 39 cloture votes so far this session, which has been under way since January 2009. Is the increasing use of cloture an example of pure obstructionist politics, as Biden's statement would imply? It's more complicated than that, said Ritchie. In the early '70s, when Biden first came to the Senate, the membership of both the Democratic and Republicans parties were more ideologically diverse and, as a result, party-line votes were scarce, Ritchie said. "In the late '80s, the two parties became more internally coherent and cohesive," he said. "As a result, leadership was invoking cloture a lot more." This dynamic has come to a head in recent years when the Senate leadership, whether Republican or Democratic, has had such narrow majorities, Ritchie said. The minority is more likely to unify against legislation, effectively filibustering a bill. As a result, the majority is essentially forced to round up 60 votes to keep the process going. Sarah Binder, a congressional expert teaching at George Washington University and a fellow with the Brookings Institution, echoed Ritchie. In the early 1970s, senators "were less likely to vote with fellow partisans, so there was a less partisan use of cloture," she said. "Today, there's no ideological overlap between the parties." Binder also pointed out that the size and scope of the leadership's agendas has grown dramatically in recent years, but it has little time to get big things done. Invoking the 60-vote rule is one way to keep the agenda moving. Back to Biden: His overall point -- that the Senate more frequently requires 60 votes to get things done these days -- has some truth to it. According to Senate experts, there have been more and more cloture votes as the upper chamber becomes increasingly split along party lines. But he said "every single solitary decision has required 60 senators," which is an exaggeration. In 2009, for example, there were 397 roll call votes. According to the Senate Historian's office, only 39 of them were cloture votes. Indeed, we found plenty of major bills that did not require 60 votes to start or end debate, including a bill meant to give more children health insurance and a bill to prevent mortgage foreclosures. Furthermore, the Senate frequently passes noncontroversial bills unanimously, so there are countless pieces of legislation such as post office namings and resolutions that don't require 60 votes. As we like to say at PolitiFact, words matter; if Biden had said every "major" decision requires 60 votes, he would have been on more solid ground. As a result, we rate his claim False.

pomt-07885	Americans spend 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax law. It costs us $163 billion to comply with our tax laws annually.	true	/oregon/statements/2011/feb/05/ron-wyden/sen-ron-wyden-says-americans-spend-more-6-billion-/	Everyone tries to quantify pain, whatever its form or cause. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health use a scale of zero to 10, with zero meaning pain free and seven through 10 reflecting "severe" to "disabling" pain. We’re not immune from it either here at PolitiFact, where we rate statements on a six-step scale from blissfully True to a full-out, Pants on Fire ridiculous lie. So it’s not surprising that politicians try it as well, especially on complicated topics like tax reform. Putting things in an easy-to-understand - and stark - manner is often the difference between building support and quietly fading away. Which is why Sen. Ron Wyden said this on Jan. 24, 2011: "Americans spend 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax law. It costs us $163 billion to comply with our tax laws annually." That’s a lot of time and money -- and pain. It’s also something people of all walks of life can relate to since just about everybody fills out a tax form and almost everybody dislikes it. But is it true? Wyden hopes so since it’s a key element in promoting his plan for simplifying the tax code. To push his plan Wyden is building a case that would appear easy to win - the tax code is too complicated, to bulky and dense, and hard for even smart people to negotiate by themselves. There’s plenty of data to support the idea. According to the Internal Revenue Service itself, the tax code today is 3.8 million words compared to 1.4 million in 2001. You want pain? Here’s some more. The code now comprises 25 volumes and takes up nine feet of shelf space, the IRS reports. It’s also a full-employment plan. Two companies publish newsletters daily that report on new developments in the field of taxation; the print editions often run 50 pages to 100 pages. Had enough? There’s plenty more, including proof of what Wyden says - it’s complicated. "Ninety-percent of taxpayers rely on preparers or tax software packages" to do their returns, the IRS says. The agency also suggests that those bold souls who venture out alone might want to reconsider: "The IRS (help line) received 110 million calls in each of the last two fiscal years. That is a staggering number, and not surprisingly, the IRS was unable to answer more than 25 percent of them." So it’s complicated. But Wyden’s comment is a whole new order of hardship since 6.1 billion hours translates to 695,870 years. That’s a lot of time, averaging 44 hours for every completed tax return. It’s huge but it’s also correct. The 2010 report from the National Taxpayer Advocate, the official - and independent - ombudsman for the IRS crunched the numbers for the 2008 tax year, which is the most recent year for which data is available. "U.S. taxpayers and businesses spend about 6.1 billion hours a year complying with the filing requirements of the Internal Revenue code and that figure does not include the millions of additional hours that taxpayers must spend when they are required to respond to IRS notices or audits," the NTA reported. It also agreed with the cost. The Advocate’s office "estimates that the costs of complying with the individual and corporate income tax requirements for 2008 amounted to $163 billion – or a staggering 11 percent of aggregate income tax receipts." That’s good enough for us. As Tax Day approaches, we rate this claim True. Comment on this item.	None	Ron Wyden	None	None	None	2011-02-05T06:00:00	2011-02-24	['United_States']
pomt-09528	Franklin Roosevelt never allocated more than 12 percent of GDP to federal spending, while the percentage for Barack Obama is not projected to drop below 22.8 percent.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/11/glenn-beck/beck-claims-obama-has-outspent-even-franklin-roose/	In the Feb. 8, 2010, edition of Fox News Channel's Glenn Beck Program, host Glenn Beck compared two Democratic presidents -- Franklin D. Roosevelt and Barack Obama -- on how much they spent on the federal government. "When you look back in history, who do you think of when I say huge government programs?" Beck told viewers. "Hey, I know, how about FDR? Let me show you FDR spending compared to our GDP. Here's what FDR did. You see 10.7 [percent], 1934, OK? That's when FDR first said, 'Hey, we got to change everything because Hoover, he is stunk on ice.' The lowest was 7.7. The highest, if you see, in 1941, you might remember that date because it's supposed to live in infamy. 1941, 12 percent of GDP. Got it? "All right. Now, let me take a look at President Obama's spending. This is what Obama is planning on spending. Whoa! Remember -- highest, 1941, was 12 percent. Here's the lowest at 22.8 percent." We thought we'd check the comparison. We located the federal statistical table from which Beck appears to have taken his numbers. It's a historical table in the president's proposed budget for fiscal year 2011, which was released in early February. Specifically, it's "Table 1.2 -- Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-) as Percentages of GDP: 1930–2015." We can quickly confirm Beck's figures for Obama. Between 2009 and 2015, the percentage of GDP accounted for by federal spending (that is, the figures in the column "total outlays") is expected to hover between a maximum of 25.4 percent (for 2010) and minimum of 22.8 percent (for 2013). The only caveat is that the figures for 2010 through 2015 are projections. However, the projections from the president's budget are widely considered credible, so we have no quibble with them. The statistics in the table also jibe with many of Beck's numbers, including the 12 percent of GDP that Beck said FDR spent on the federal government in 1941. But take note: A viewer looking at Beck's chart on TV would see Roosevelt's numbers running from 1934 to 1941. If that was the extent of Roosevelt's presidency, Beck would be absoutely correct about his spending pattern. But contrary to the chart Beck showed viewers, Roosevelt served in the White House until his death in 1945. And the figures for 1942 to 1945 pose a problem for Beck's theory that Obama is spending more, proportionately, than Roosevelt did. Between 1941 and 1942, Roosevelt doubled what the federal government spent, reaching 24.3 percent of GDP for 1942. And it didn't stop there. For both 1943 and 1944, federal spending represented 43.6 percent of GDP. And for 1945 (a year when both Roosevelt and Harry Truman served as president) it was 41.9 percent. There's an obvious caveat: The United States' involvement in World War II began on Dec. 7, 1941, so the big rise in government spending primarily had to do with the costs of fighting a two-front world war. Still, we see problems with Beck's approach. First, Beck doesn't note for the viewer that he's only using pre-World War II statistics -- much less justify that decision. He simply shows a chart covering eight of the 12 years FDR spent in the White House. Second, while there's an argument to be made for excluding the years of World War II -- it was a singular, and singularly expensive, federal undertaking -- the contrast between Roosevelt's situation and Obama's is not black-and-white. Obama, too, is a wartime president, winding down a war in Iraq and expanding one in Afghanistan. There are additional reasons to be skeptical of a comparison of spending under Roosevelt and Obama. For instance, while the government has expanded greatly since Roosevelt's time, much of the increase has come from entitlements like Social Security, a program that was established under Roosevelt and has been driven more by demographics than individual presidents' policy choices. In fact, under conservative icon Ronald Reagan, federal outlays as a percentage of GDP ranged between 21.3 percent and 23.5 percent -- in the same ballpark as the rates projected for Obama's presidency. Also, Dean Baker, a liberal economist who co-directs the Center for Economic and Policy Research, noted that Roosevelt increased government's share of the economy at a much faster rate than Obama has. When Herbert Hoover was president in 1930 -- three budgets before Roosevelt's first -- the federal share of GDP was 3.4 percent. By 1934 -- when Roosevelt assembled his second budget in the midst of the Great Depression -- it had risen to 10.7 percent, or more than triple its level just four years earlier. By contrast, the equivalent comparison between President George W. Bush and Obama is much more modest. In 2006, under Bush, the federal government share of GDP was 20.1 percent. In Obama's second year, 2010, it's projected to be 25.4 percent, an increase of about one-quarter -- far smaller than the change under Roosevelt. "The rate of change matters," Baker said. "Imagine [the reaction if] Obama took the government to 40 percent of GDP" or beyond. So there are a number of problems with Beck's comparison. But let's look again at what he said -- that federal spending under FDR peaked at 12 percent of GDP and under Obama it is projected to not drop below 22.8 percent. On Obama, he is correct. But Beck undermines his claim on FDR by his too-convenient framing of the statistics. If he had been transparent about excluding the World War II years, we might have given him the benefit of the doubt. Instead, he pulled a fast one on viewers. Beck's end date excluded rates of federal spending that were twice as high as what Obama is on pace to spend. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07986	"The refusal of many federal employees to fly coach costs taxpayers $146 million annually."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/18/newsmax/newsmax-courts-readers-statistic-about-federal-was/	Newsmax, a conservative newsmagazine and website, recently sent an e-mail pitch to potential subscribers that spotlighted a few examples of supposedly wasteful federal spending. We saw it when one of our readers passed it along. "Dear Newsmax Reader" the e-mail read. "The average American works three months a year, WITHOUT PAY, for the federal government. If you are in a higher tax bracket, you could be spending up to half your life working for Uncle Sam. And how is your money being spent?" The example that most piqued our interest was this one: "The refusal of many federal employees to fly coach costs taxpayers $146 million annually." We decided to check to see if the claim was correct. An Internet search first directed us to a column by Brian Riedl, a fiscal policy specialist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The column was posted on the website of the Orange County Register on Nov. 25, 2009. Further research revealed that the data came from a September 2007 study by the Government Accountability Office, the non-partisan investigative arm of Congress. The GAO concluded that at least $146 million was spent on "improper first- and business-class travel government-wide" between July 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006. It arrived at this number by obtaining billing information from government travel charge-card databases operated by Bank of America, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase and U.S. Bank. The audit focused on executive branch agencies and wholly owned government corporations and excluded travel by the judicial and legislative branches. The rules defining justified premium air travel are complicated, but generally speaking, agencies can provide business class travel in circumstances such as when an individual has a physical disability that is certified by a medical professional or when a flight is to or from a destination outside the continental United States, exceeds 14 hours and is taken without a rest stop en route or at destination. GAO researchers selected what they described as a statistically valid sample of 96 premium-class flight purchases with a price tag of $391,000. These purchases received close scrutiny. "For each sample transaction, we requested that the entities provide the travel authorization, travel voucher, travel itinerary, and other related supporting documentations demonstrating justification for premium travel arrangements," the report said. "Based on the information provided, we assessed whether premium class travel was properly authorized and whether the premium class travel was justified in accordance with (federal) or other applicable travel regulations. If, after repeated requests, the entities did not provide us with the supporting documentation, we concluded that the premium class travel was improper." All told, about two-thirds of the trips were either "not properly authorized, not properly justified, or both," the GAO found. This percentage was then projected onto the universe of federal premium travel billings, which was $230 million over the time period studied. Adjusting slightly downward as a hedge against statistical error, GAO concluded that $146 million of the $230 million spent on premium flights was unjustified. The GAO noted that the differences between first class, business class and coach tickets can be wide. Citing data from the General Services Administration, a federal agency, the GAO noted that government fare for business-class travel "is typically more than 5 times the price of coach class travel for comparable routes, with some tickets costing more than 10 times as much. First-class travel can be even more costly. For example, we found that a round-trip first-class ticket from Washington, D.C., to London cost over $12,000 compared to a business class ticket that would have cost about $6,000, or a coach class ticket that would have cost less than $800." If you trust GAO's sampling and overall methodology -- and we have no reason to doubt it -- then Newsmax's presentation of the data seems pretty accurate. We only had two quibbles: • The GAO's methodology doesn't delve into the question of the employee's motives when seeking a premium-class flight, so we think '"refusal" is too strong a word for Newsmax to use when describring how the federal employees reacted to the idea of flying coach. • GAO noted that the $230 million spent on premium-class flights accounted for less than 1 percent of the cost of all federal government flights during the period. So the overcharges themselves amounted to less than 1 percent of the total spent on federal airline travel. When we asked Riedl about this, he said that "the point is that taxpayers paid for $146 million in largely unnecessary spending. Whether that accounts for 1 percent, 10 percent, or 50 percent of the total federal travel budget is irrelevant to that point." We do think that knowing the full context might give readers a different impression, and we believe the word "refusal" oversteps. But in general, the $146 million number was determined by what appears to be a credible methodology, and by a group -- the GAO -- without a partisan axe to grind. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Newsmax	None	None	None	2011-01-18T18:59:01	2011-01-14	['None']

pomt-00474	"I am the only (state attorney general) in America fighting to hold the big tech companies accountable for their behavior."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/aug/14/josh-hawley/josh-hawley-only-state-ag-going-after-tech-giants/	Josh Hawley, the Republican state attorney general who is challenging incumbent Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill in November’s election, has gained a reputation for taking on tech giants Google and Facebook. Last Nov. 13, Hawley announced that he was issuing an "investigative subpoena" to Google, as part of an investigation into whether the search-engine company has violated Missouri’s consumer-protection and antitrust laws. Then, on April 2, he issued an "investigative subpoena" to Facebook, to look into how the social media company shares and tracks its users’ data. Earlier, he had launched investigations into app-based ride-sharing service Uber and credit bureau Equifax, according to his "tech investigations" web page. On several occasions recently, Hawley has portrayed himself as being unique among state attorneys general in this regard. "I am the only (attorney general) in America fighting to hold the big tech companies accountable for their behavior," he said in a primary victory speech on Aug. 7, 2018. Hawley made similar assertions in two radio interviews. So is Hawley really alone among state attorneys general in holding tech companies accountable? The record shows that while Hawley has been notably active on tech issues, he is far from alone among attorneys general. For instance, more than 40 state attorney generals from both parties -- including Hawley -- signed a joint letter on March 26 to seek information from Facebook, following revelations that user information from Facebook profiles was provided to third parties without the users’ knowledge or consent. "With the information we have now, our trust has been broken," the letter said. "We appreciate the information you have provided to date and expect your full cooperation going forward in our inquiries into your business practices. To that end, we expect a full accounting for what transpired. …" For years, "attorneys general of both parties have been deeply involved in privacy prosecutions and other Internet-related matters," said James Tierney, the former attorney general of Maine who has taught about state attorneys general at both Columbia University and Harvard University. When we checked with Hawley’s campaign, they said he was referring to cases in which the office issued civil investigative demands, which is the equivalent to a subpoena from an attorney general’s office. However, we found a few other examples of current state attorneys general going that far against tech giants, or even further (by filing lawsuits). Here they are, in reverse chronological order: • Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, filed suit against both Facebook and Google in June 2018 over their alleged failure to "maintain legally required information for Washington state political advertising placed on their online platforms since 2013." • West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, filed suit in April 2018 against Equifax, alleging that the company "ignored warnings to secure its system" and "failed to safeguard consumer information," leading to a large data breach. • Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, sued Uber in March 2018 for violating Pennsylvania’s data breach notification law. • Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, served a civil investigative demand on Equifax over the data breach in November 2017. • Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat, filed suit against Google in January 2017 over how the company "maintains and uses data collected from Mississippi public school students who have Google’s G Suite For Education accounts." • Earlier, in 2015, Hood subpoenaed Google over their search practices, and when the maneuver was blocked in court, 40 attorneys general -- 23 Republicans and 17 Democrats -- wrote a letter in support of Hood’s subpoena. In addition, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York have begun an investigation into Facebook over its data-sharing practices, including a "demand letter" sent on March 20, 2018. It’s worth noting that Hawley’s actions against Google and possibly Facebook are potentially broader in scope than the other lawsuits mentioned above. The other active lawsuits tend to be more narrowly framed around specific violations. Hawley has had a "pioneering role in confronting ‘big tech’ over potential consumer protection and antitrust violations," said Kelli Ford, a spokeswoman for the Hawley campaign. Scott Cleland, the president of Precursor LLC, a consulting firm specializing in the Internet, agreed that Hawley’s actions stand apart from other attorneys general. Hawley "is investigating Google broadly, and civil investigative demands are serious legal actions," Cleland said. Mark David Blafkin, founder and partner at Verge Strategies, a consulting firm that has advised Silicon Valley companies, said that civil investigative demands are not necessarily made public, so it would be "tough to confirm how many others have been sent to tech firms." Blafkin said that while the statement Hawley made is probably overly broad, he added that Hawley has shown himself to be one of the leaders among attorney generals in investigating the tech sector. Our ruling Hawley said, "I am the only (state attorney general) in America fighting to hold the big tech companies accountable for their behavior." This is an exaggeration. His actions against Google and Facebook do have a particularly broad focus, but he is not alone in pursuing tech giants -- other attorneys general have also filed lawsuits against those and other companies during the past two years.

pomt-05907	"One out of every three automobile fatalities can be attributed to alcohol."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/03/nathan-deal/deal-dui-super-bowl-ad-cites-good-statistic/	Georgians watching Sunday’s Super Bowl broadcast will be treated to seeing football’s two best teams battle each other, the best commercials to hit television, a halftime show by pop legend Madonna -- and a cameo by Gov. Nathan Deal. That’s no misprint folks, Gov. Deal. Deal won’t be tackling anyone or stiff-arming defenders. Instead, he will appear in a 60-second ad urging Georgia motorists to get a ride home if they’ve had too much alcohol on Super Sunday. Of course, there’s an app for that. It’s called Drive Sober Georgia, and it lists phone numbers for programs that drive tipsy motorists home for free. "No one wants to stop you from enjoying the game," Deal says in the public service announcement. "However, having too much to drink and getting on the road endangers not only your life, but the lives of others. One out of every three automobile fatalities can be attributed to alcohol." PolitiFact Georgia wondered: Did Deal score a truth touchdown with this alcohol fatality statistic or should the governor get flagged for a misleading statement? We consulted the top authorities on drunken driving data. They all cite numbers from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Its Fatality Analysis Reporting System collects yearly statistics on deadly traffic crashes, including ones involving drunken drivers The NHTSA defines "alcohol-impaired" crashes as those that involve a driver with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher. A sober driver could be at fault. According to the NHTSA, 10,839 people were killed in crashes involving alcohol-impaired driving in 2009. This accounts for 32 percent of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. The percentage dropped slightly in 2010, when 10,228 people died in alcohol-impaired crashes or 31 percent. Georgia’s percentage of crashes involving alcohol-impaired driving sits well below the national average. In 2010, it was 24 percent, or 298 out of 1,244 fatalities in the state. The Peach State’s neighbor, South Carolina, had the highest percentage of DUI traffic-related fatalities -- 44 percent. Although Georgia apparently has a smaller percentage of DUI traffic-related fatalities than most states, some advocates against drunken driving believe the Peach State can do more on the issue. Mothers Against Drunk Driving advocates were at the state Capitol this week to urge lawmakers to support Senate Bill 41, which would require first-time offenders of Georgia’s DUI laws to have an ignition interlock device in their car for at least six months. Georgia law currently requires the device for repeat DUI offenders. An ignition interlock device works like a Breathalyzer. It measures a driver’s blood-alcohol content and prevents the car from starting if the reading surpasses a certain level. "MADD believes Georgia can do better," said Frank Harris, the group’s state legislative affairs director. So, back to Deal’s claim. Is he right? Can one out of every three automobile fatalities be "attributed" to alcohol? Deal’s numbers are right. But his language is slightly off. According to the NHTSA’s definition, the drunken driver doesn’t have to be at fault for the crash to count as an "alcohol-impaired" wreck. Deal would have been more accurate to say that one out of every three automobile fatalities involves a drunken driver. That said, this is a minor point. Deal’s overall point holds. We won’t dock him on this technicality. He earns a True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2012-02-03T06:00:00	2012-01-31	['None']

pomt-07307	"In the first year of the Obama administration, more jobs were created in the private sector than in the eight years of the Bush administration."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/17/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-more-jobs-created-obamas-first-y/	During a May 16, 2011, interview with Bloomberg television, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., praised President Barack Obama’s record on jobs while taking a shot at former President George W. Bush. "We got in this situation where we had tax cuts for the wealthiest people in our country, which did not create jobs," she said. "In the first year of the Obama administration, more jobs were created in the private-sector than in the eight years of the Bush administration, with all of the tax cuts that President Bush had." According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy shed almost 4.2 million private-sector jobs during the first year of the Obama administration -- January 2009 through January 2010. Meanwhile, during eight years under Bush, the economy gained a net 188,000 private sector jobs. So while job growth under Bush was anemic by historical standards, it was still better than the 4.2 million jobs lost under Obama. That means Pelosi was wrong. A Pelosi spokesman, Nadeam Elshami, told PolitiFact that Pelosi simply misstated a talking point that she’d used many times before. In one variation provided by her office, Pelosi sent out a news release that said in part, "America has had 12 consecutive months of private-sector job gains totaling 1.5 million. That is more private-sector jobs than were added in the eight years of the Bush Administration." But when we checked a similar incarnation of this talking point, we only gave it a Half True -- technically correct, but misleading due to cherry picking. Pelosi was right that the economy created 847,000 jobs during the period she indicated. But she would have been incorrect if she’d cited total employment rather than private-sector employment. And she chose her starting and ending dates in a way that was highly favorable to Obama and unfavorable to Bush. Pelosi essentially started counting from the low point for jobs and only counted the upward part of the trendline, while denying Bush the same method. This time, in talking to Bloomberg TV, Pelosi didn’t even get the statistic technically correct. So we rate it False.

After we started our fact-check, the link was no longer in use and had been flagged as suspected phishing. It is not an official Delta website. Such hoaxes that Delta or other airlines, including Southwest Airlines, have been giving away free tickets have circulated for years. Don’t take the surveys — these are all scams. Graham Cluley, a security analyst, has previously written about the repercussions of the Southwest scam in 2016: "The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions – whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. .... If you are ever in any doubt as to whether a special offer on Facebook is genuine or not, visit the company’s real website to see if they mention the competition there – or whether they are warning of a scam." Delta spokeswoman Kate Modolo pointed to this page on Delta.com where legitimate offers from the airline are located.

pomt-07325	Increasing the bottle deposit to 10 cents on a case of water bottles could literally double the price of that product in the store.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/may/13/matt-wingard/rep-matt-wingard-says-price-certain-beverages-coul/	Last week the Oregon House approved an expansion of the state’s bottle bill law, adding single-serve coffees, energy drinks, teas, and sports drinks to the list of beverages that now require a nickel return deposit. Furthermore, House Bill 3145 calls for that nickel to increase to 10 cents if the redemption rate falls below 80 percent for two years in a row. Rep. Matt Wingard, R-Wilsonville, was among a dozen legislators in the House to vote against the bill. He thinks it’s a great idea, really, but he doesn’t like the possibility of a dime per drink. "I’m hung up on the fee increase," he said in his floor speech, later adding, "The deposit going from 5 to 10 cents, for instance on a case of water bottles, could literally double the price of that product in the store." Now, bottled water is cheap. And the bottle bill deposit is per container, not per size of said container -- so, the more containers, the more deposits (refundable, of course.) But could a nickel increase really double the price of a set of water bottles? A quick check at a downtown Portland Safeway showed these prices for a case (24) of half-liter water bottles: - Aquafina, $4.99 each, or $3.99 each if you buy two cases. - Arrowhead spring water, $3.79 each at Safeway Club price. - Refreshe, $3.34 each on sale (Safeway Select brand). Wingard had similar examples, as well as a bargain price of $2.99 for a case of Crystal Geyser at an Albertsons. Tack on $2.40 and that is indeed nearly a doubling of the original price of $2.99. But context is critical and we want to provide some of that. One, Wingard has highlighted just about the worst-case scenario when it comes to the bottle bill deposit. Small bottles of plain water --added under the bottle bill in 2007 -- are cheap. Most deposit-worthy drinks do not cost mere pennies, they’re more like 89 cents apiece or $1.59 each or $6.99 for a six-pack. Two, we know Wingard and others are convinced the bottle deposit will creep up to a dime -- but that’s not a done deal. Under the current bill, the deposit would stay at 5 cents unless the redemption rates falls below 80 percent for two consecutive years; the earliest measurable years are 2014 and 2015, with the soonest a dime could be levied Jan. 1, 2017. (The new canned or bottled drinks in this legislation, such as coffee, tea, energy drinks, etc. are not counted as part of redemption rates until January 2021.) The redemption rate rate for 2009 was 75 percent, according to the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative and it’s expected to be several percentage points lower for 2010. Still, that doesn’t mean a 10-cent deposit is right around the corner. Three, Wingard doesn’t point out that the current deposit on a case of water is already high, compared with its base cost. At $1.20, that $2.99 case of water rings up at $4.19 under the current bottle bill law. And four, water bottle lovers can get their $1.20 or $2.40 back, just by returning the containers. It’s not a fee that you forfeit forever. And if you don’t redeem your bottles and cans, know that the beer and wine distributors will get to keep the cash. Wingard, in response, said he focused his statement on bottled water. Yes, taken narrowly, the cost of a case of water could nearly double. But Wingard does a lot of heavy lifting to get to his statement and ignores two particularly crucial points: The fact that there’s already a five cent deposit on these items -- meaning, really, the percent increase of what buyers are shelling out is much smaller than 100 percent -- and also the fact that this is money that is refundable -- you get it back as soon as you return the bottles. So the "cost" could be zero. Because his statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate his claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03195	"While fat-cat bureaucrats at the Department of Education are getting paid an average salary of $102,000 a year, teachers in Georgia are getting paid half of that."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/30/paul-broun/brouns-education-salaries-remark-mostly-target/	Georgia congressman and U.S. Senate candidate Paul Broun has been a loud voice in the push to reduce government control of education policy. He has criticized the federal Education Department as being a bloated bureaucracy with excessive spending and salaries. In this vein, Broun and other Republican members of the House narrowly approved the Student Success Act, aimed at lessening the federal government’s power to set national education standards. The bill would reverse many of the provisions of the 2002 No Child Left Behind law. After the vote, Broun touted the approval of his amendment to the bill, requiring more DOE transparency on jobs and salaries. "While fat-cat bureaucrats at the (U.S.) Department of Education are getting paid an average salary of $102,000 a year, teachers in Georgia are getting paid half of that," Broun said in a press release. "My amendment would hold the Department of Education accountable for their costly salaries, and force the government to take a closer look at how scarce education dollars ought to be spent." Broun used a similar phrase the day before when announcing House approval of his amendment. And again last week during a campaign event in Marietta: "Those fat-cat bureaucrats that have never taught a child to read have an average salary across the department of over $101,000 a year," Broun said. PolitiFact knows that teachers work hard for their money. But was Broun correct that a teacher’s Peach State pay was half that of federal education workers? We decided to hit the books and find out. The average Georgia public school teacher’s salary for the 2012-2013 school year was $52,956.27, according to Matt Cardoza, spokesman for the state Department of Education. For the federal salary figure, Broun used information from the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank, along with a database of federal employees’ salaries, his spokeswoman told us. For 2011, the latest year of information Broun referenced, there were 4,620 employees listed in the database for the federal Education Department. The Heritage Foundation’s "The Foundry" blog featured a story about the U.S. DOE in 2010 and cited the department’s average employee salary -- not including executive salaries -- of $103,000 for that year. The majority of federal civilian, white-collar employees are classified and paid on the General Schedule (GS), according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The GS pay schedule has 15 grades and 10 steps in each grade. Pay varies by geographic location. GS grades 8-12 are considered midlevel positions. We contacted the Heritage Foundation for background on its reported 2010 salary figure. Lindsey Burke, an education fellow at the organization, provided us with the DOE’s salaries and expenses overview chart for full-time workers. The organization considered the employees at the GS15 level downward, but did not include any executive-level salaries. They then used the government’s standard salary table to determine the pay for each of those levels and averaged those figures to ultimately produce the average employee annual salary. The $103,000 figure is also listed on the DOE overview chart as the average, nonexecutive employee salary for the 2010 budget. A spokesman for the U.S. DOE provided us the same Salaries and Expenses overview table, this time from the fiscal 2014 budget request. The department lists the average employee level as GS12 for the fiscal years 2012-2014. For those years, the average, nonexecutive employee salary was $103,773; $104,198 and $105,020. In looking at these figures, it is important to consider other variables that influence the salary figures. The Bureau of Economic Analysis notes that the skill and education levels for federal jobs tend to be higher because of the job requirements in the federal government. The BEA also noted in recent years that the federal government is hiring more highly skilled workers who tend to make more money. Many of the lower-paid positions have been contracted out to the private sector. It is also important to consider the high cost of living in the Washington area. The cost of all basic necessities is higher in the Washington area than in Atlanta, one of Georgia’s largest and most expensive cities. Groceries are 10 percent more; utilities, 11 percent more; transportation, 6 percent more; and the most expensive item, housing, is 170 percent more expensive in D.C. than in Atlanta, according to the CNN Money cost of living calculator, one of many that makes city comparisons. So does Broun’s claim get a passing grade? Broun said that Georgia teachers make half of what average federal Education Department employees make. On just the numbers, he is very close to accurate. But Broun fails to take into account the high education and experience level that federal employees at this level typically possess, as well as the high cost of living in the Washington, D.C., area versus residing in Georgia. Broun’s statement is accurate but needs some clarification. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2013-08-30T06:56:35	2013-07-19	['Georgia_(U.S._state)']

pomt-14844	"The United States (is) the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to displaced persons and refugees."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/17/barack-obama/obama-us-largest-donor-displaced-personsrefugee-re/	With nearly two dozen U.S. states now saying they won’t resettle Syrian refugees, President Barack Obama took a moment during the G20 meeting to acknowledge the pressures faced by other countries at the gathering. "The United States, as the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to displaced persons and refugees, stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Turkey, Europe, and others in trying to help those who need help right now, even as we hope to reduce the flow of migrants because of the situation inside of Syria," Obama said. We wanted to know if America in fact is the largest provider of aid for displaced people and refugees. If we simply look at the dollars spent on international assistance, the numbers largely back up Obama. (We asked the White House for comment but didn't hear back.) But the dollars don’t tell the whole story. Any country that houses refugees incurs costs apart from its support for international aid agencies. The dollars Development Initiatives is a British organization focused on gathering data to help reduce global poverty. It reports that in 2012, the United States provided more humanitarian aid than any other nation. The U.S. government spent $3.8 billion, representing nearly a third of all aid from donor countries. The second highest donor was not a single country but agencies of the European Union with about $1.8 billion in humanitarian aid. From the Development Initiatives report, here are the top 10 donors in 2012: Donor Amount Share of total United States $3.8 billion 29.4% EU $1.88 billion 14.5% United Kingdom $1.16 billion 9.0% Turkey $1.03 billion 8.0% Sweden $784 million 6.1% Germany $757 million 5.9% Japan $606 million 4.7% Canada $512 million 4.0% Norway $509 million 3.9% Australia $442 million 3.4% The United States ranks first, but it also represents the largest national economy. As a percentage of Gross National Income (the research center’s economic yardstick), Luxembourg and Sweden are the top donors giving 0.16 percent and 0.14 percent respectively. This table shows the line-up, again using Development Initiative data: Donor Share of GNI Luxembourg 0.16% Sweden 0.14% Turkey 0.13% Norway 0.10% Denmark 0.09% Ireland 0.08 Finland 0.07% UK 0.05% Netherlands 0.05% Switzerland 0.05% Belgium 0.04% Canada 0.03% Australia 0.03% New Zealand 0.03% United States 0.02% We should note that these donations go toward problems that range beyond refugees and people displaced by conflict. This humanitarian aid also provides food when people are starving and shelter when a flood or other disaster drives them from their homes. To get a slightly different angle, we looked at the donors to the UN High Commission on Refugees. That’s the UN lead agency for refugee assistance. Again, the United States comes out on top with $792 million given in 2012. The next highest was Japan. Susan Fratzke is a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a research center in New York City. Fratzke said the donor numbers only take you so far. "Not all the refugee aid goes to the UNHCR," Fratzke said. "Some governments also give to big nonprofits, like the International Rescue Committee." But Fratzke said specific to Syria, America has been the largest donor to help people fleeing that conflict. She said she’s comfortable that all told, the United States most likely is the largest donor across the board. Hosting refugees There’s another way to look at providing aid, though, and that’s by looking at how many displaced persons are residing in a country. According to the UNHCR, in 2014 no country dealt with more refugees than Turkey. More than 1.5 million Syrians fled their war-torn country to find safety in Turkey. Not only is Turkey the fourth largest donor of humanitarian aid, it shelters the greatest number of refugees within its borders. Data from UNHCR produces this table: Country Refugees Turkey 1,587,345 Pakistan 1,505,516 Lebanon 1,154,024 Iran (Islamic Rep. of) 982,025 Ethiopia 659,510 Jordan 654,116 Kenya 551,336 Chad 452,877 Uganda 385,498 China 301,047 Afghanistan 300,421 Sudan 277,818 Iraq 271,137 United States 267,174 Cameroon 264,102 Yemen 257,632 France 252,228 South Sudan 248,152 Egypt 236,050 Russian Federation 235,717 It is difficult to put a dollar value on such efforts, but the hosting of refugees represents another form of providing assistance. Our ruling Obama said that the United States is the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to displaced persons and refugees. We found that America gives more humanitarian aid than any other country, and it ranks first in supporting the UN’s lead agency in helping refugees. While the numbers are a bit inexact, an expert we reached said all the numbers point toward the United States being the top donor. While other countries give more relative to the size of their economy, the total volume of dollars matters most in terms of being able to provide more food, shelter and medical care. However, countries that host refugees also provide humanitarian assistance in ways that are not so easily tallied. Those efforts should factor into an assessment of each nation’s level of aid. Obama was likely thinking in terms of financial support and in that regard, his statement holds water. But it’s important to acknowledge that other forms of assistance matter. The statement is largely correct but it requires a bit more information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-11-17T17:09:22	2015-11-15	['United_States']

pomt-05297	Says "over 40 percent of recent county bonds are for Precinct One, northeast Travis County," because he "is quick to identify projects that help make the East Side a desirable place to live."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/may/21/ron-davis/travis-commissioner-ron-davis-says-more-40-bond-mo/	In a campaign flier, Democrat Ron Davis says that as a Travis County commissioner, he has worked to "bring in what’s good" to the northeastern portion of the county, which he represents. He then highlights the amount of money slated to be spent on road and other projects in his precinct, No. 1, from a bond package approved by Travis County voters in 2011. "Over 40 percent of recent county bonds are for Precinct One, northeast Travis County," the flier says. "Why? Because Commissioner Ron Davis is quick to identify projects that help make the East Side a desirable place to live." Davis, first elected in 1998, has three challengers in the May 29, 2012, Democratic primary: Del Valle school board member Richard Franklin III, Pflugerville City Council Member Victor Gonzales and former City of Austin employee Arthur Sampson. For this article, we fact-checked whether Davis was right about the amount of bond money headed to his precinct — and whether the money was spent on his projects because he was quick to point them out. On the first front, Davis’ number stands up. The second aspect proved impossible to confirm. The Travis County Commissioners Court consists of four commissioners and the county judge, who is elected countywide. Each commissioner represents a single precinct, and each precinct is drawn by the commissioners to represent about the same number of residents. That means that if bond money were to be distributed evenly among the population, each precinct would get about 25 percent of the funds. So, Davis’ statement that more than 40 percent of the spending authorized in the recent bond vote will happen in a single precinct (his) — for whatever reason — drew our attention. Let’s look first at the bonds approved by voters. Travis County residents voted in November 2011 to give the county permission to borrow about $215 million over seven years for road, drainage and park improvements, as well as land purchases to preserve open space, according to a Nov. 8, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article. Proposition 1, with $132.8 million in spending, authorized more than two dozen transportation projects to be built, including more than 20 miles of new or expanded roads, the article says. Proposition 2 allowed $82.1 million to be spent on eight park projects or land purchases. An Oct. 23, 2011, pre-referendum Statesman news article about Proposition 1 notes that the proposed transportation projects were not evenly spread among the county’s precincts. The bulk of the sought spending, the article says, would take place in the rapidly developing northeastern part of the county near the 5-year-old Texas 130 tollway. But the story did not speak to how much of the overall proposed bonds would support projects in Precinct 1. On that front, Davis’ campaign sent us a spreadsheet detailing the bond proceeds that will be spent in Precinct 1: $90.4 million, which the spreadsheet accurately says is 42 percent of the bond money approved by voters in 2011. Specifically, Davis’ spreadsheet has 19 entries. The first 13 are separate Precinct 1 road projects, including more than $12 million to widen part of Blake-Manor Road from two to four lanes and add bike lanes and sidewalks, as well as about $300,000 to add sidewalks to part of Hunters Bend Road. The 13 road projects account for more than $70 million of Davis’ cited $90.4 million. The next two entries in the Davis campaign’s spreadsheet are estimates — done by Steven Manilla, head of the county’s Transportation and Natural Resources Department — of how much Precinct 1 will get from about $5 million in bond money that was approved for road repairs and bike safety projects countywide. Manilla estimated that Precinct 1 will get about $3.4 million of that money. The final four spreadsheet entries are estimates, also from Manilla, of Precinct 1’s share of Proposition 2 bond money, including $10 million to buy land for parks along creeks and rivers and $1.3 million for improvements at East Metro and Webberville parks. We spotted a couple of wrinkles in the campaign’s breakdown. First, we noticed that the Davis campaign lowballed the cost of each of the 13 road projects by using figures not taking into account money included in the bond propositions to cover inflation costs and expenses associated with issuing bonds — meaning Davis’ analysis undercounts the share of the total bond money going to Precinct 1. So, we adjusted the figures in the spreadsheet, which lifted the Precinct 1 share to about 45 percent. However, the biggest single expenditure on Davis’ breakdown, more than $15 million to widen a section of Cameron Road and add bike lanes and sidewalks, reflects spending in neighboring Precinct 2 as well as Precinct 1. Manilla told us in an interview that’s because that part of Cameron Road, on the western side of Texas 130, is the boundary between the two precincts. Removing half of the funding for the Cameron Road project drops the Precinct 1 share a little, to 41 percent — still in line with the "over 40 percent" that Davis cites. Precinct 1’s share of the bond money is larger than that of the other precincts, Manilla told us. He said Precinct 3, which covers most of the western portion of the county, came in second, with 25 percent of the bond money. So, Davis’ cited percentage holds. However, we did not find independent indicators to support, or disprove, his contention that the share of bond money flowing to Precinct 1 reflects his quickness to identify desires. In a telephone interview, Davis described himself as a strong advocate who begins thinking well in advance about what projects should be in an upcoming bond package and communicating with county staff members about problems such as traffic congestion and how they can be addressed. He identifies what his precinct needs, he said, by listening to residents and assessing what infrastructure projects are necessary to accommodate the development happening in that part of the county. Davis also said his quick work to ready projects for the bond package means that when a project in another part of the county falls through, he has something ready to go to fill the opening. "If you snooze, you lose," he said. We asked Davis whether there was a way to document his quick identification of projects for his district and how it has influenced which projects ended up in the 2011 bond package. He said the results of his work are reflected in "what’s on the ballot." He also said much of his cited work to ready projects came in responding to and meeting with constituents, which he said he didn’t document. Manilla, who similarly said Davis reacts quickly to constituent complaints, told us by phone that he did not have a way to document the commissioner’s quickness to identify potential bond-election items. According to Manilla and county documents, items made it onto the 2011 bond election ballot through a process involving more than the commissioners and county judge. After the Commissioners Court signed off in December 2010 on preparing for the 2011 bond vote, county staff put together a list of 120 possible bond projects with a total price tag of $638 million. A citizens bond advisory committee then shortened the list, which commissioners tweaked before unanimously voting to put the propositions before voters. Manilla noted a couple of ways that commissioners can influence the makeup of a bond package, pointing out that commissioners communicate with county staff members about what projects are needed in their precincts. He also said commissioners can influence the work of the citizens bond committee through their appointees; each commissioner and the county judge, who leads the Commissioners Court and is elected countywide, selects three people to serve on the committee. And, of course, commissioners ultimately vote to put the projects before voters and can make changes to the final list. At their Aug. 9, 2011, meeting, the commissioners made a few revisions, including adding a Precinct 1 road project — the widening of Taylor Lane. Davis was the commissioner who moved to have the project added. We asked County Judge Sam Biscoe to address Davis’ claim that his quick identification of projects caused Precinct 1 to land its share of bond-backed items. Biscoe declined. Broadly, Biscoe earlier told us that each commissioner merits some credit for the bond proposals affecting their districts, but not all of it. "I have no reason to think (Davis) didn’t do his part," Biscoe said. "But I do know there were many other contributors." He pointed to the work done by the county staff, the other commissioners, himself and the citizens committee. Biscoe also agreed that the heavy amount of development taking place in the northeastern part of Travis County is a reason more bond money is being spent on infrastructure projects there. Historically, Biscoe said, there wasn’t much development in the area so there was no need for the projects. Now, there’s a lot of development, he said, "so we are trying to catch up." Our ruling The numerical part of Davis’ two-part claim — that more than 40 percent of the 2011 bond money will be spent in Precinct 1 — holds up. But the determining impact of Davis’ quickness is unproved. It’s our sense that several factors, perhaps including the commissioner’s alacrity, affected which items landed on the ballot. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Ron Davis	None	None	None	2012-05-21T18:01:36	2012-03-01	['Travis_County,_Texas']

pomt-10592	"Now, I also support the Bush tax cuts. Sen. McCain voted against them originally. He now believes they should be made permanent. I'm glad he agrees they should be made permanent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/27/mitt-romney/mccain-switched-tax-vote/	Mitt Romney has repeatedly charged John McCain with flip-flopping on tax cuts. He points out that McCain twice voted against President Bush's tax changes before deciding to support them. He repeated his attack at the Republican debate in Boca Raton. Though Romney omits some important details, we again find that he is accurately summarizing McCain's record. In 2001, McCain voted against a $1.35-trillion tax cut package, arguing that the tax cuts didn't do enough for the middle class, and because of a need for increased defense spending. Two years later, McCain again citied spending for opposing $350-billion in additional tax cuts, specifically citing the unknown costs for the war in Iraq. But in 2006, McCain changed position and voted to extend the Bush tax cuts for five years. He said not to do so would be tantamount to raising taxes at a time when the economy was sputtering. McCain said he supported the tax-cut extensions, which reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, because "American businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect." In an interview on Fox News on Dec. 28, 2007, he expressed no regrets about his tax votes against Bush. He said he would have preferred a plan that included spending cuts as well as tax cuts, but added that he believes the tax cuts should now be made permanent. "We presided over the greatest increase in the size of government since the Great Society," McCain said. "Spending went completely out of control. It's still out of control. Wasteful earmark spending is a disgrace, and it caused us to alienate our Republican base. So these tax cuts need to be made permanent. Otherwise, they would have the effect of tax increases. But, look, if we had gotten spending under control, we'd be talking about more tax cuts today." McCain has responded by calling Romney a flip-flopper on taxes and other issues, but the fact remains: McCain voted the way Romney says. We find Romney's claim to be True. And if you'd like to see our previous same rulings on this issue, see here and here. Updated: This post has been updated to correct the reasons McCain gave at the time for opposing tax cuts in 2001. Our initial posting attributed his reasons to statements he made later about fiscal restraint.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2008-01-27T00:00:00	2008-01-24	['George_W._Bush', 'John_McCain']
pomt-07882	"United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/06/rebecca-kleefisch/wisconsin-lt-gov-rebecca-kleefisch-says-us-student/	In January 2011, GE Foundation, the philanthropic organization of General Electric Co., gave Milwaukee Public Schools the largest donation it ever received: $20.4 million to improve science and math education. Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch was among officials who attended an event announcing the five-year gift. She made this comment: "We know that right now United States students are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math." Many leaders have long lamented the science and math performance of U.S. students compared with that of students in other countries. But we wondered about Kleefisch’s 25th out of 29 comment. It was picked up in a news report by WTMJ-TV and repeated in a blog post on Jan. 26, 2011 on Kleefisch’s website, RebeccaForReal.com. Kleefisch’s aide, Jeanne Tarantino, said the Republican lieutenant governor based her comment on talking points provided by GE, including one that was similar to what Kleefisch said: "U.S. students rank 25th out of the 29 developed nations for preparedness in math and science." We could see how Kleefisch might have misspoken by saying "developing" rather than "developed" countries; the U.S. certainly would be in the developed category. But even at that, does the U.S. really rank near the bottom in science and math? GE told us the source of its talking points was a U.S. Department of Education summary of the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA, as it is known, is a ranking of 15-year-olds based on international tests. The 2009 results were released in December 2010, about a month before the grant was announced. Contrary to Kleefisch’s statement, PISA does not do a science-math combination ranking; they do not do a ranking of 29 countries (developed or otherwise); and they do not rank the U.S. 25th in science or math. We confirmed those points with Holly Xie, author of the Education Department summary. PISA assesses science and math separately and it does so with two sets of rankings. One is for 34 industrialized countries and the other is for 65 entities -- 60 countries plus five other educational systems. So how does the U.S. rank? According to the Education Department summary: In science literacy, Finland ranked first and the U.S. essentially tied for 13th among the 34 industrialized countries (as its score was "not measurably different" from a number of other countries). However, if the actual scores are used, the U.S. ranked 17th. In the larger group of 65, Shanghai-China ranked first and the U.S. tied for 19th. So, in science, the U.S. ranked in the top half of industrialized countries and even higher in the larger group. In math literacy, Korea ranked first and the U.S. essentially tied for 18th among the 34 industrialized countries. Again, the U.S. score was "not measurably different" from a number of other countries. However, if the actual scores are used, the U.S. was tied for 25th. In the larger group of 65, Shanghai-China ranked first and the U.S. tied for 24th. So, in math, the U.S. ranked in the lower half of industrialized countries and much better in the larger group. Let’s review. Kleefisch said U.S. students "are achieving at number 25 out of 29 developing countries when it comes to science and math." We assume she meant "developed" rather than "developing" countries. But her point was that U.S. students ranked near the bottom in science and math. The test results cited, however, do not include a science-math combination ranking. What they show is the U.S. ranks in the top half of industrialized countries in science; in math, it’s in the lower half, but not near the bottom. Indeed, after we requested additional information from GE, the company told us Feb. 4, 2011, that it erred in saying the U.S. ranks 25th of 29 countries in science and math. We rate Kleefisch’s statement False.	None	Rebecca Kleefisch	None	None	None	2011-02-06T09:00:00	2011-01-26	['United_States']
pomt-03846	Cobb is one of the largest school systems (in the nation) that is debt free.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/15/joellen-smith/cobb-e-splost-advocates-use-no-debt-argument/	On Tuesday, Cobb County residents will go to the polls to vote on a fourth installment of the school system’s sales tax plan. The 1-cent special purpose local option sales tax, or SPLOST (E-SPLOST when the tax program is conducted by and for a school system), will be collected for five years beginning in 2014. The system expects to bring in about $717.8 million in tax collections to pay for a host of capital projects. Opponents of the program say the project list includes unnecessary items that the district "wants" but doesn’t need, and that E-SPLOST renewals have become the "crack cocaine" of the school system. School system administrators and tax supporters argue that the tax is a good alternative to property tax increases. In addition to that, supporters say, the E-SPLOST has long helped the system’s bottom line by providing money to pay off long-term debts and avoid new bond debt for system projects. "Cobb is also one of the largest school systems that is debt free," education activist JoEllen Smith said in a newspaper editorial published in a local paper last month. "If SPLOST doesn’t pass, bonds will have to be issued or reserves used." PolitiFact Georgia wondered if that enviable position was indeed true. It’s hard for most people to pay off personal consumer debt, let alone a school system responsible for funding the educational needs of just over 108,000 students. The district, the second largest in the state, has an 11-minute website video that includes the debt-free claim. And some Kennesaw businessmen, Jay Cunningham of Superior Plumbing and John Loud of Loud Security Systems, are featured in a SPLOST advocacy video also making the debt claim. Smith is a volunteer for EmpowerED Georgia, a group of parents and teachers that estimates its membership at 3,500. She and Cobb Schools spokesman Jay Dillon pointed us to a 2010 census education finance report. That report, issued in June 2012, was taken from 2010 data tables that were updated in November 2012 and collected from each state. Using the updated data, Cobb is listed as the 23rd-largest school system in the country (of the more than 14,000 listed) based on enrollment. Gwinnett County Public Schools -- Georgia’s largest school system -- is ranked 14th. The report shows that Cobb has zero long-term outstanding debt at the end of the fiscal year. The system also has no short-term debt, Dillon said. Gwinnett is not in the same fortunate financial position as Cobb. Gwinnett still has almost $580 million in debt on the books to be paid off, a schools spokesman told us. That county funds its construction projects through a portion of property tax collections, and will use current E-SPLOST revenue to pay off bonds that were used to finance some projects. The census report showed that Clayton County was the only other metro Atlanta school system without any long-term debt. Clayton County Public Schools, ranked 88th in size, paid off its last bond debt as part of a SPLOST passed in 1998, a district spokesman told PolitiFact Georgia. Cobb’s current five-year E-SPLOST expires Dec. 31, 2013. Approval from voters next week would keep the sales tax collections continuous through 2018. The money is expected to pay for several new gyms, theaters and wings, along with 407 new classrooms, at schools throughout the district. Getting approval from voters could be a challenge. In 2011, a four-year extension of the county’s SPLOST for parks, recreation and road renovation throughout Cobb passed by only 79 votes. And a 10-year regional transportation SPLOST failed in Cobb by almost 38 percentage points. Paying for capital projects, like new schools and classroom expansions, with E-SPLOST funds is quite common in Georgia, said Herb Garrett, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association. Before the E-SPLOST legislation was passed, school systems had to pay for projects through their operating funds intended for day-to-day expenses, or through bonds. Under the bond method, the money was immediately available but was paid back with interest over several years, instead of the pay-as-you-go method of financing projects with E-SPLOST collections. Using E-SPLOST funds, Cobb Schools paid off $184 million in bond debt in 2007. The school system has incurred no additional debt since then, meaning it has no outstanding bonds or loans, a state Education Department spokeswoman told us. "The SPLOST program has allowed a rapidly growing state to meet its need for school buildings," Garrett said. So what’s the fiscal fallout? Education activist and education sales tax supporter JoEllen Smith said that Cobb County Schools is one of the largest systems in the nation that is debt free. The district is the second largest in the state, and is the 23rd largest in the country, according to the Census Bureau. Cobb Schools has used previous sales tax collections to pay off long-term bond debt, which education experts said is common practice in Georgia. This pay-as-you-go system of funding projects has kept the county school system debt free. We rated Smith’s statement True.	None	JoEllen Smith	None	None	None	2013-03-15T06:00:00	2013-02-22	['None']

pomt-14455	"There is a precedent" for not nominating someone to the U.S. Supreme Court "in the middle of a presidential election."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/04/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-wrong-saying-there-precedent-not-nominat/	Ten days after the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, House Speaker Paul Ryan entered the debate on whether Scalia’s successor should be chosen before or after Barack Obama leaves the Oval Office. The Democratic president has the right to submit a nominee before he departs in January 2017, said the Wisconsin Republican, appearing Feb. 23, 2016 on CNBC’s "Squawk Box." But the GOP-controlled Senate, Ryan added, has the right not to move the nomination forward and instead await a nomination from the next president. Then co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin asked: "Should you look at whoever gets nominated on the merits of who they are, or simply on the politics of the moment?" "We are in the politics of the moment, which is we are in the middle of a presidential election," Ryan said, referring to the early 2016 primaries and caucuses. "We’ve already had South Carolina, New Hampshire and Iowa. We’re knee-deep in a presidential election. "There’s a reason for having this tradition of not nominating somebody in the middle of a presidential election, because it gets so political. I agree with that precedent, and there is a precedent for that." It’s relatively rare for a Supreme Court vacancy to occur in the months leading up to a presidential election. But Ryan’s office could not provide any examples in which a president did not make a nomination during a presidential election year. We couldn’t find any, either -- though, to the contrary, we did find a number of instances in which such a nomination was made. The record Let’s note that when it comes to filling Supreme Court vacancies, presidents decide when to nominate, and the Senate decides when to consider the nomination. Often, the administration gets a read on where the Senate stands on confirming a nominee before putting someone forward. But formally, the timing for the first step is up to the president. We found five instances over roughly the past century in which there was a Supreme Court vacancy in a presidential election year and the president made a nomination. President Nominee Nomination Outcome Franklin Roosevelt (D) Frank Murphy, to replace Pierce Butler January 1940 Confirmed Herbert Hoover (R) Benjamin Cardozo, to replace Oliver Wendell Holmes February 1932 Confirmed Woodrow Wilson (D) Louis Brandeis, to replace Joseph Rucker Lamar January 1916 Confirmed Woodrow Wilson (D) John Clarke, to replace Charles Evans Hughes July 1916 Confirmed William Taft Mahlon Pitney, to replace John Marshall Harlan February 1912 Confirmed Technically, there was not a vacancy, but Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations in June 1968, five months before the election. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.) Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated. In October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day. He put William Brennan directly on the court with a "recess appointment" to replace Sherman Minton. He then formally nominated Brennan in January 1957. A February 2016 article in the Cook Political Report by University of Georgia political scientist John Anthony Maltese notes there were also presidential election-year nominations made to the Supreme Court in the 1800s. Our rating Ryan said: "There is a precedent" for not nominating someone to the U.S. Supreme Court "in the middle of a presidential election.’ It’s rare for a Supreme Court vacancy to occur during a presidential election year -- the last time was in 1940, although there were also two election-year nominations in 1968. But we could find no instances in which a president faced with a Supreme Court vacancy during a presidential election year did not make a nomination. It occurred five times between 1912 and 1940, and each time the nominee was confirmed. We rate Ryan’s statement False.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-03-04T14:36:48	2016-02-23	['None']

pomt-07757	One half of federal spending goes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid while the other half goes to other programs funded with money "borrowed from a foreign land."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/25/rob-woodall/congressman-offers-students-math-lesson-federal-sp/	U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Lawrenceville, recently offered some high school students a lesson in Washington math. The freshman House member held a town hall meeting with students from Duluth High School in Gwinnett County. The Republican is not fond of the way the federal government is managing its finances, particularly how much it is borrowing to pay its bills and who it is borrowing from. "Woodall said every nickel that came in during the last two years went to pay interest on the national debt, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid," the Gwinnett Daily Post reported on Feb. 2. "And every other nickel spent went for things like the environment, parks, homeland security and defense and was borrowed from a foreign land." A couple of loyal PolitiFact Georgia readers wondered whether what Woodall told the kids was true. His spokeswoman, Jennifer Drogus, told us the Post accurately reported what he said and offered a detailed explanation. "For the amount of money the federal government receives in tax revenue, at current levels, we can only fund mandatory spending projects [including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.] and the net interest," Drogus wrote us in an e-mail. "Right now, our nation’s tax revenue can only cover mandatory spending projects. Therefore, remaining money to cover discretionary spending projects must be borrowed." The budget deficit and national debt are big issues in Washington, with talk of a government shutdown as Democrats and Republicans debate how to best cut spending. Woodall wants to slow borrowing. "There’s not a problem in in this nation that can be solved by borrowing more money," Woodall said, according to the Post. We reached out to a few experts to see whether Woodall’s comments about federal spending were correct or was he sharing fuzzy math with those students. First, let’s look at how the federal budget works. The federal budget year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. In fiscal year 2009, which ended Sept. 30, 2009, the U.S. government spent slightly more than $3.5 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A year later, the government spent just under $3.5 trillion. The government is projected to spend about $3.7 trillion this fiscal year. The federal government separates its budget into two categories, mandatory spending and discretionary spending. Mandatory spending primarily goes toward entitlement programs including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Uncle Sam spends about $2 trillion a year on these programs, according to CBO data. Discretionary spending accounts for about $1.3 trillion a year. About half of that money goes to the Defense Department. The remainder is spent on homeland security, NASA, the FBI, agriculture, the Census Bureau and hundreds of other federal programs. The rest of federal spending, about $200 billion, is interest paid on the federal debt. So where does the money come from to pay the bills in Washington? About two-thirds of it comes from you. CBO data show slightly more than $2 trillion a year comes from individual and corporate income taxes and social insurance taxes. The government borrows the rest of the money, about $1.5 trillion during each of the past three fiscal years, by selling securities in its capital markets to make up the difference. That debt is bought by buyers in the U.S. and foreign investors. We’ll talk more about those investors shortly. Woodall told the students that about half of federal spending goes to those entitlement programs and interest on the debt. The CBO’s numbers show he’s right. So what about this "borrowed from a foreign land" part? The CBO says domestic investors own 53 percent (the Federal Reserve owns the largest share) of the federal debt. The remaining 47 percent is owned by investors overseas. China and Japan are neck and neck in terms of which foreign investors have the largest share of that 47 percent, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst for the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based group that started in 1981, said the congressman was "roughly in line" regarding his statement that "every nickle" goes toward entitlement programs such as Medicare. The CBO’s numbers show it’s closer to 60 percent. "That’s a simplification, but it’s fairly correct," Peuquet said. Peuquet disagreed with the congressman about foreign spending. "I would say [Woodall] is somewhat off the mark because not all of what we’re borrowing is abroad," Peuquet said. Craig Jennings, federal fiscal policy director of OMB Watch, a research and advocacy group founded in 1983, agreed. "If he is implying that all of it comes from a foreign land, that is wrong," Jennings said. Woodall said in a telephone interview Thursday that he recognized that the majority of the federal debt is held domestically, adding that he owns some Treasury bonds himself. Woodall said his conversation with the Duluth students didn’t go into that kind of detail, just his larger point that much of the debt is owned by foreign countries. "Don’t think that I’m trying to persuade anyone we’re not buying American bonds," Woodall said. We conclude that the congressman was essentially correct on how federal money is spent. He said about 50 percent of federal funds are spent on mandatory programs such as Social Security. The CBO’s data show a slightly higher percentage is spent on these programs, but we figure that’s close enough. As for the congressman’s other point, federal data and the fiscal watchdogs we talked to said Woodall’s comments could leave the wrong impression about the federal debt. Putting it all together, we rate his statement to the students as Half True.

pomt-00360	Says Joe Donnelly "voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/12/one-nation-pac/immigration-joe-donnelly-amnesty-criminals-indiana/	A digital ad by One Nation, a Republican PAC, in the Indiana Senate campaign claims Democrat Joe Donnelly flip-flopped on the issue of amnesty for illegal immigrants. "In Congress, Joe Donnelly claimed he was 100 percent opposed to amnesty and promised to send back any illegal immigrant who commits a crime," the narrator says as a hooded man walks along a dark sidewalk holding a knife on screen. "But in the Senate, Donnelly voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse," the narrator continues as a man climbs over a tall fence and another is handcuffed. Donnelly has frequently stated he opposes granting amnesty to criminals. So did he really vote to let them legalize their status? The bill in question is the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which gave provisional legal status to those who entered the country illegally. The legislation was a major bipartisan compromise from a group known as the Gang of 8, which included Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio. Donnelly voted in favor. While it passed the Senate, it never reached a vote in the House. The Donnelly campaign said Donnelly has consistently opposed amnesty and said this bill did not grant amnesty. He supported it because it increased border security. "He only supported the 2013 bill because it wasn't amnesty and instead placed renewed focus on identifying and deporting hardened criminals -- including drunk drivers and domestic abusers," said Will Baskin-Gerwitz, Donnelly’s spokesman. Amnesty is a tricky word. Experts told us earned path to legalization was more appropriate in this case. In addition to border security, the bill did provide a way for people in the country illegally to apply for legal status. The bill allowed qualified unauthorized immigrants to apply for registered provisional immigrant status. After 10 years, they could apply for a green card. Eligible for that status were undocumented immigrants who had been in the United States since Dec. 31, 2011, paid their assessed taxes, passed background checks, and paid application fees and a $1,000 penalty. Prohibited from the path to citizenship were those convicted of three or more misdemeanor offenses, as well as those convicted of felonies, certain foreign offenses or unlawful voting. The ad said Donnelly granted amnesty to criminals, drunk drivers, and perpetrators of domestic violence. That’s not the case. Criminal is a loaded term, as it may bring to mind a person with a serious criminal record. Legally, a misdemeanor is a crime. So technically, a person with a misdemeanor would be considered a criminal. The legality of the images on screen vary. Carrying a knife isn’t a crime, but stabbing someone is a felony. Trespassing is generally a misdemeanor, depending where the person is trespassing. A person with a record of two misdemeanor charges could apply for provisional legal status, while the third count would make them ineligible. As for drunk driving and domestic violence, James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University, said they could be considered a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the state in which they occurred and sometimes, the level of violence. But the bill had more specific language carved out for those crimes. It said that a person with three or more drunk driving offenses was inadmissible. They would also be ineligible if they served at least one year in prison for domestic violence, or were convicted for it more than once. U.S. Rep. John Cornyn, R-Texas, introduced an amendment that curbed the criminal allowances using stronger language; anyone convicted of domestic violence or drunk driving would be ineligible. Donnelly voted against Cornyn's amendment. "Without the amendment, more individuals convicted of crimes, including domestic violence and drunk driving, would get to apply for legalization," said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Experts told us Cornyn's amendment was a poison pill that would have made the legalization program impossible. It would have required before legalization could move forward a 90 percent apprehension rate at the Southern border. "The 90 percent standard, for example, was intended to sink the bill by creating an impossible standard," said Ian Ostrander, a political science professor at Michigan State University. "Often these amendments are created with the intended purpose of using the motion to table vote in a campaign ad." Our ruling One Nation said, "In the Senate, Donnelly voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse." Donnelly’s vote for the immigration bill excluded drunk drivers with multiple offenses and those convicted of domestic violence from the path to citizenship. He voted against an amendment that would have excluded more people charged with such crimes from attaining citizenship.

pomt-07357	"I'm well aware that medical marijuana is a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of [pancreas] pain condition."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/08/robert-watson/former-house-minority-leader-says-marijuana-recogn/	On the night of April 22, 2011, Rep. Robert Watson, R-East Greenwich, was stopped at a Connecticut sobriety checkpoint and ultimately charged with both driving under the influence and marijuana possession. In a floor speech the following Tuesday, the then-House minority leader said he was not under the influence. He said he had not smoked marijuana, and his blood-alcohol level tested at 0.05, which is below the legal limit of 0.08. Watson told fellow House members he had "a very small bag with trace amounts of marijuana and a smoking instrument." He was carrying the marijuana, he said, in case he had an attack of pancreatitis. "I'm well aware that medical marijuana is a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of pain condition," he said in his speech, which garnered a standing ovation from Republicans and other House members at the time. (But a week later, the Republican caucus ousted him as minority leader.) Watson, citing personal privacy, has not released details of his medical record; results of his blood test will be the subject of his court hearing in Connecticut. But we wanted to weed out the facts on whether marijuana is actually recognized as a treatment for the pain of pancreatitis, an extraordinarily painful condition that Watson described as akin to a gunshot to the chest. First, some background. The pancreas, located behind the stomach, releases enzymes that aid in digestion. It also releases the insulin the body needs to control blood sugar. The enzymes flow out a tube into the small intestine near the stomach. Unfortunately, a portion of that tube is shared with the gallbladder. Sometimes tiny stones form in the gallbladder, migrate down the tube and block the portion that drains the pancreas. The result is painful inflammation -- pancreatitis. Doctors can usually see the stones with ultrasound or some other form of imaging. In those cases, either the stone eventually works its way free or doctors remove it. In either case, doctors urge patients to have the gall bladder removed. End of problem. The second major cause of pancreatitis is alcohol. When that's the case, doctors insist that patients abstain from drinking because one attack can lead to others, damaging the pancreas in a way that leads to chronic pancreatitis. "The recommendation is pretty much to not take any alcohol because alcohol is a toxin to the pancreas," said Dr. Alyn Adrain, a gastroenterologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Brown University. Heavy smoking may also increase the risk, said Dr. Vikesh Singh, director of the Pancreatitis Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. That risk can be difficult to tease out because smoking and drinking often go hand in hand. Pancreatitis can also be caused by inherited deformities in the pancreas. There have also been at least two studies covering four patients suggesting that marijuana, by itself, can cause a pancreatitis attack. In other instances, doctors have trouble pinpointing a cause. Watson politely declined to answer most questions about his condition, saying he believes his health should be a private matter. Watson did, however, reveal elements of his illness during his speech on the floor of the House. He said his initial attack of pancreas pain was at Halloween. He said he went to the hospital the next day, where he had a severe reaction to a drug, prompting doctors to put him in a medically induced coma for five days. He said he subsequently had other attacks. He did not disclose the number and severity. "I did treat with medical marijuana on one of those rare occasions where I had that debilitating pain that had me flat on my back" wondering whether to call an ambulance, he said. He also reported having a recurrence the day before his arrest, but said he did not use marijuana then. Watson said that when he tried the drug, "it provided relief and it alleviated the pain . . . I believed it was responsible self-therapy." Watson said he had not applied for authorization to use medical marijuana. But is marijuana "a recognized, medical, viable treatment for this sort of pain condition," as he contends? As a treatment for pancreatitis pain, let's be blunt. The simple answer is "No." Both Doctors Singh and Adrain said there are no studies in the medical literature showing that marijuana is an effective treatment for the pain of a pancreatitis attack. "There is no reason to use marijuana for acute pancreatitis," said Singh. "There are no studies evaluating the use of cannabis for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis pain." "I've never given it for chronic pain from pancreatitis and I don't know anyone who has," said Adrain. When we contacted Watson, he said his statement should be considered in the context of treatment for severe pain in general. The state's guidelines for medical marijuana use say "qualifying debilitating medical conditions" include "a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or its treatment" that produces any of six conditions, including "severe, debilitating, chronic pain." In that context, the doctors we interviewed said marijuana MIGHT be useful in some cases, just as the drug helps some patients cope with cancer pain. "It might help. There's just no good evidence to prove it’s worthwhile," said Singh. Finally, we looked to Canada, where the use of medical marijuana has been legal for years. Health Canada, which authorizes medical marijuana use, lists seven conditions -- multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or disease, cancer, HIV, epilepsy, severe arthritis -- where the use is routinely accepted. For other conditions, a specialist must confirm "that conventional treatments have failed or [are] judged inappropriate to relieve symptoms." And Dr. Mark Ware, associate medical director of the McGill University Health Centre Pain Clinic in Montreal, told us in an email that pancreatitis is a different kind of pain. "This is a visceral pain syndrome and most cannabis studies have focused on neuropathic pain." The personal reports you can find on the web "have not been validated or evaluated." So as far as we could determine, it's neither recognized nor recommended by the medical community for this use. There are certainly no studies to support its use. We rate his statement False.

pomt-08130	When President Franklin D. Roosevelt started Social Security, "it only affected widows and orphans," and when Medicare began, "it was a small program."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/08/barack-obama/barack-obama-description-how-social-security-medic/	In a Dec. 7, 2010, press conference, President Barack Obama kicked off his effort to sell a deal he had struck with congressional Republicans to extend the tax cuts initially passed under George W. Bush. The president had already been facing opposition from congressional Democrats and liberal activists for siding with the Republicans by agreeing to extend expiring tax cuts for wealthier Americans. So part of Obama's comments were aimed at explaining and justifying why he had compromised rather than continuing to fight for the position for which he had advocated as a presidential candidate. In making the argument that half a loaf was better than none, Obama cited two earlier landmark programs -- Social Security and Medicare. "Not everybody agrees with us," Obama said. "I know that shocks people. The New York Times editorial page does not permeate across all of America. Neither does the Wall Street Journal editorial page. Most Americans -- they’re just trying to figure out how to go about their lives and how can we make sure that our elected officials are looking out for us. And that means because it’s a big, diverse country and people have a lot of complicated positions, it means that in order to get stuff done, we’re going to compromise. This is why (President Franklin D. Roosevelt), when he started Social Security, it only affected widows and orphans. You did not qualify. And yet now it is something that really helps a lot of people. When Medicare was started, it was a small program. It grew." An alert reader wrote us to suggest that Obama was not accurate in the way he described the origins of these programs. So we decided to look into it. Social Security On Social Security, Obama had a point that the program started slowly and expanded over time. But he was flat wrong that it began by serving only widows and orphans. This can be confirmed by looking at a historical page on the Social Security Administration's own website. Title II of the Social Security Act of 1935 "was the new social insurance program we now think of as Social Security," the SSA website says. "In the original Act, benefits were to be paid only to the primary worker when he/she retired at age 65. Benefits were to be based on payroll tax contributions that the worker made during his/her working life. Taxes would first be collected in 1937 and monthly benefits would begin in 1942. (Under amendments passed in 1939, payments were advanced to 1940.)" The history page continues, "The original Act provided only retirement benefits, and only to the worker. The 1939 amendments made a fundamental change in the Social Security program. The amendments added two new categories of benefits: payments to the spouse and minor children of a retired worker (so-called dependents benefits) and survivors' benefits paid to the family in the event of the premature death of a covered worker. This change transformed Social Security from a retirement program for workers into a family-based economic security program." So, widows and orphans were indeed covered early on, but they were only covered after retired workers had already been granted coverage -- not the other way around, as Obama had suggested in the news conference. An SSA spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the president's interpretation "is not accurate." Still, if Obama's specific details were wrong, he was more accurate on the larger point. "Social Security did start small and expand in many ways after its initial enactment," said Paul Van de Water, a Social Security expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. "Benefit amounts were increased in 1939, even before the first payments were made. Coverage was originally limited to workers in commerce and industry and was expanded substantially in 1950 and thereafter. Disability benefits were added in 1954 for people age 50 and over and in 1960 for those under 50. Early retirement benefits were added in 1956 for women and in 1961 for men. Automatic cost-of-living increases in benefits were not enacted until 1972." Medicare Obama is even less accurate in his description of Medicare. The health care program for the elderly was passed in 1965, and in retrospect, it emerged with remarkable speed. Medicare "was implemented in less than one year, an administrative tour de force of which the SSA commissioner at the time, Bob Ball, remained proud until the day he died," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. The bill even made provisions for elderly Americans who would not have been covered since they had not worked long enough to qualify for Social Security. Under an amendment named for Sen. Winston Prouty, R-Vt., this coverage was financed with general revenues. It's true that Medicare has expanded in size and cost since its creation. But that is mostly because health care was less expensive at the outset, and because of natural population growth, said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. "Medicare was not small when it started," said Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer. "It provided a well-defined right to insurance for the elderly and was up and running within one year. Much of the infrastructure of program was in place by 1966, and it was quite substantial." So let's recap. Obama had a point that Social Security started small and expanded slowly, but he was clearly incorrect that the first groups to be covered were widows and orphans. On Medicare, it's not accurate to say, as the president did, that the program started "small." It was up and running for elderly Americans within one year -- four years faster than it will take the health care exchanges created in Obama's own health care bill. On balance, we rate the item False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-12-08T17:29:55	2010-12-07	['Franklin_D._Roosevelt', 'Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-07925	The Republican Party raffled off an AR-15 assault rifle at the 2010 Oregon State Fair.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/jan/29/suzanne-devlin/did-oregon-republican-party-members-raffle-ar-15-a/	Turner resident Suzanne Devlin recently sent a letter to the Statesman Journal, taking Sarah Palin and other Republicans to task for using gun-heavy language and then trying to distance themselves from the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and several others in Tucson, Ariz. , in early January. "I volunteer at the Democratic booth at the state fair. Last summer, as is my custom, I walked over to the Republican booth. The differences between the two parties couldn't be better illustrated than what I encountered," she wrote. "While we were passing out free ice water, the Republicans were raffling off an AR-15 assault rifle." A reader suggested PolitiFact Oregon take this on, and we found the topic interesting enough to tackle. Is a semiautomatic AR-15 an assault rifle? And were members of the Republican Party raffling one off at the Oregon State Fair? We called Greg Leo, our go-to man at GOP state party headquarters, and asked about the rifle raffle. The state party spokesman said, "It is true." How we love easy confirmations. Leo went on to explain that the raffle was a fundraiser to benefit the Marion County Republican Central Committee. The state fair was just one of the locations where people could buy a $5 raffle ticket, and the rifle (.223 caliber) was not on site. The winner was directed to a dealer, who processed the paperwork and handled the transaction. Gun raffles, apparently, are not uncommon. The Oregon Firearms Federation is in the midst of raffling off five AR-15 rifles. Now, is it accurate to call an AR-15 an "assault rifle"? Technically speaking, Kevin Starrett of the Oregon Firearms Federation says, it’s not an assault rifle because an assault rifle must be able to switch between semiautomatic -- one bullet with each trigger pull -- and fully automatic machine-gun style modes. The AR-15, in this case, is a semiautomatic only. Genuine assault rifles are hard to get in the United States, outside the military. Still, look up the term "AR-15 assault rifle" online and you’ll find that even firearms sites describe the AR-15 as an assault rifle. When an unnamed man showed up with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle at an Obama event in Phoenix nearly two years ago, news media used both "assault weapon" and "assault rifle" to describe the firearm. (CNN here; MSNBC picking up AP here.) The Associated Press Stylebook says the correct term is assault weapon, not assault rifle. In any case, fans say the AR-15 is terrific for hunting and target shooting; it’s versatile and precise. (Fashionable, too. Look online to find a Pepto pink Hello Kitty version.) There’s a quibble with the definition of "assault rifle," but it’s a small one. We rate this claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-08550	Rick Perry thinks "injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug (the HPV vaccine), without a parent's consent, is a good idea."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/oct/01/lone-star-first/lone-star-first-funded-democratic-governors-associ/	Zeroing in on Gov. Rick Perry's long tenure in public office, Lone Star First, an organization that's funded and supported by the Democratic Governors Association, unleashed an attack ad called "Cracks." It features a photo of Perry that splinters more with each charge the association levels against him. "Twenty-five years as a politician changes you," a narrator says in the ad posted on YouTube Sept. 28. "You think injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug, without a parent's consent, is a good idea. You think it's right to use a government takeover of Texas homes and property so foreign companies can get rich. You spend taxpayer money on a fancy mansion while Texas faces an $18 billion deficit. On the issues, 25 years as a politician has changed Rick Perry, for the worse." We've previously touched on Perry's past advocacy of a toll-road network, his rental digs and the budget shortfall. Now we wondered about Texas girls receiving a "controversial drug" without parental consent. On Feb. 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order that required the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating that Texas girls entering sixth grade receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus. Certain types of HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, can cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Critics said the vaccine, Merck & Co.'s Gardasil, was too new to declare safe. Some said too that Perry's order would infringe on parental rights or give girls a false sense of security, leading them to be sexually active too young. Lawmakers blocked the plans, and earlier this year, Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, told us that the governor's office considers the mandate "null and void." She said Perry "will not pursue it in the future." At the time, we rated Barely True Perry's statement that his executive order didn't make the vaccine mandatory. But did Perry's move mean children would receive shots without parental consent? Brannon Jordan, a spokesman at the Democratic Governors Association, pointed us to three news articles to back up the statement. While the articles quoted parents expressing anger at Perry for requiring something they considered none of his business, none of the clips mention parental consent. The mandate, which was scheduled to go into effect for the 2008-09 school year, included an opt-out "in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority on their children's health care." It ordered the Department of State Health Services to allow parents dissenting for philosophical or religious reasons to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. That form enables parents to enroll their children in public school even if they lack state-required immunizations. It's automatically granted as long as parents provide all required information. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman at the Health and Human Services Commission, told us that "the child would only get the vaccination if the parent took the child to get it." Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman at the Department of State Health Services, said: "Vaccines cannot be given to children without consent of a parent or a legal guardian." Texas law lists two primary people who can consent the immunization of a child — the guardian and a person authorized under the law of another state or a court — and secondary people if the former are unavailable, including a grandparent, stepparent, or aunt. Janet Realini, a physician and president of Healthy Futures of Texas, a San Antonio-based nonprofit striving to reduce teen and unplanned pregnancies, told us that the mandate would have been no different than state requirements for numerous immunizations that Texas requires children need to attend public school, such as the polio vaccine, measles and hepatitis B. When we checked back with the DGA, spokeswoman Emily Bittner told us that she wasn't familiar with the ad. We asked to speak with someone who was, but no one had gotten back to us as we were wrapping up our research. Where does that leave us? Perry's executive order would have required Texas girls to receive a vaccine against HPV before entering sixth grade. The order included an opt-out for parents who objected to the vaccine. But there's no evidence — not a scintilla of proof — that shots would have been given without parental consent, and saying so preys on the fears of parents who objected to Perry requiring the vaccine. Parents and guardians are gatekeepers for children getting the vaccinations required for students to go to Texas schools. Perry's failed mandate would not have changed that, and the ad sounds like Perry endorsed forcing families against their will to vaccinate their children with a scary drug.

pomt-10779	"First, he said he would take all of our troops out in six months, and now he acknowledges it would take a year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/17/joe-biden/richardson-defaults-to-fast-as-possible/	At the Democratic CNN/YouTube debate on July 23, 2007, Bill Richardson said he wanted all troops out in six months: "This is what I stand for: I believe we should bring all the troops home by the end of this year, in six months, with no residual forces -- no residual forces." Sen. Joe Biden immediately challenged him on the feasibility of the timetable, saying "Number one, there is not a single military man in this audience who will tell this senator he can get those troops out in six months if the order goes today." Sen. Hillary Clinton also said she doubted the six months number. Experts disagree on how quickly withdrawal could occur. But some believe a speedy withdrawal could take place in less than a year if non-essential equipment was left behind. As time has gone by, though, Richardson has gradually dropped the phrase "six months" from his arguments for a hasty withdrawal. In a subsequent debate on Aug. 19, Richardson said withdrawal could be completed in six to eight months. At a Sept. 26 debate, moderator Tim Russert asked Richardson if it was possible to withdraw troops in less than a year; Richardson said it was, but he didn't claim the six-month time frame. So Biden is on solid ground saying that Richardson's six-month figure seems to be a thing of the past. But he falls short when he says Richardson accepts a year-long time frame. In a Richardson campaign video, a narrator says Richardson's time frame to withdraw troops is "as quickly as they can safely exit the country." His web site -- www.getourtroopsout.com – emphasizes withdrawal in a matter of months, citing several past examples of large troop movements that have occurred in "as little as three months" or "in just a few months." It may be strategically smart of Richardson to drop the controversial six-months number that distracts from his main argument of a fast withdrawal. But we can't find any examples of Richardson "acknowledging" a year-long withdrawl time-frame either. We rate Biden's charge half-true.

pomt-14341	"The Trans-Pacific trade deal could cost America 448,000 more jobs."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/mar/24/bernie-sanders/tufts-university-study-has-bernies-back-trans-paci/	Bernie Sanders’ campaign is flooding Ohio airwaves with a TV ad that attacks the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a job killer. "The Trans-Pacific trade deal could cost America 448,000 more jobs," says the narrator of the ad, which has run 200 times in Cincinnati and Cleveland, according to the Political TV Ad Archive. Railing against foreign trade deals is a running theme in Sanders’ campaign. He’s been quoted saying that he opposed every trade deal that has called for his vote, and that NAFTA, CAFTA, and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China are "a disaster for the American worker." (Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, even though she used to promote it as secretary of state.) The ad says the deal among 12 Pacific Rim countries could cost America 448,000 jobs. Since Sanders is using such a specific figure, we wanted to know where that number is coming from, and how other experts view that estimate. Is it possible for anyone to know how many jobs the deal could cost the United States? The TPP’s table of contents is exhausting to look at. There are 30 chapters, with titles like "Textiles and Apparel" and "Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures." Jeronim Capaldo, research fellow with the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University, is the chief author of the study that came up with 448,000 jobs lost as a result of the TPP. He explained the elements behind that projection. Other economists use models that assume a baseline of either 100-percent employment, or a static annual employment rate, and calculate from there, Capaldo said. Those models look at trade as though it’s in a vacuum, without consideration of what workers in the world economy might experience. He believes that his study is more realistic. "The first step is to understand the effect that this trade deal would have on growth, which in economics is GDP," Capaldo said, "and the second is the effect that a change in GDP would have on employment, based on the analysis of 50 years of data that we have for every country in the world." In the United States, total income has decreased constantly since the mid 1970s, Capaldo said. "That is pretty defining in people’s lives, and if it’s constant, it’s a significant element of the story." The Tufts model projected employers’ short-term costs going up as a result of the TPP, Capaldo said. In reaction, bosses cut pay, which negatively impacts workers’ ability to buy stuff. A loss in consumption goes hand-in-hand with a loss in investment, and those two factors result in further job loss. And the types of jobs that would be lost are an important part of the story. "Take the case of Oregon," he said. "People who lose jobs on ranches and factories in eastern Oregon aren’t going to turn around and immediately find a high-tech job in Portland. It doesn’t happen that way." We found another economist who agrees that the TPP will cost jobs, but not quite to the prediction Capaldo’s study makes. Dean Baker, the co-director at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the 448,000-jobs figure "wouldn’t be my best guess, but it’s not an obviously ridiculous number." Baker said the gains and losses go both ways. Trade deals "open up our markets, but we import much more than we export," Baker said. That means we are operating at a trade deficit, and when there is less demand in our economy, that leads to higher unemployment. "Implicitly, if we had a smaller trade deficit, we’d be closer to full employment," he said. The Tufts researchers were too pessimistic in their predictions, Baker said. "Assuming nothing will offset the job losses is an overly strong assumption," Baker said. "The Tufts study fails to acknowledge countervailing effects. Factors outside the trade deal will counteract job loss caused by the trade deal. So the actual number is likely to be less." For example, he explained, increased unemployment in manufacturing due to the TPP and increased imports might lead to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates often encourage construction and development, and investments in those sectors, which would create jobs in construction and development. But the manufacturing sector would still take a hit. We got a very contrary opinion from Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which favors free trade. He told us he regards the 448,000 figure as "somewhere between junk and rubbish." Hufbauer analyzed the NAFTA trade deal in a paper, "NAFTA at 20," which went over similar ground with regard to trade deals and employment. "We found zero association between freer trade agreements and larger employment deficits," he said, adding, "The model the Tufts researchers use is not available. They don’t publish it, so it’s hard to check it." Capaldo, who co-authored the Tufts study, laughed a little when we asked him about access to his model. He told us that models are made up of two things: the description of the methodology used, and the code that computes the data to achieve the predicted outcome. "There is not a single organization that makes their computer code public," Capaldo said. "I compare it to a restaurant. You look at the menu and see the ingredients and you can ask the waiter how a dish is made. They’ll give you everything that’s in there, but they won’t give you the recipe. They’ll give you all you need to understand how it’s done, but they won’t give you the code. The computer code is the chef-work." Other publicly available economic models, he said, are merely templates. Our ruling Sanders’ ad says that the Trans-Pacific Partnership "could cost America 448,000 more jobs." We’ve asked economists to sort out the good and bad of trade deals before, and found that their opinions on outcomes can be wildly contradictory. So when it comes to predicting such outcomes, it really depends on whose Magic 8 Ball you use. It’s important for people to understand that this number is an estimate, and it’s the biggest estimate we found. Critics of the Tufts study say it goes the furthest to predict doomsday figures, without acknowledging offsetting effects. The author of the Tufts study says that other research glosses over the real-world elements that change the lives of workers in a global economy. A one-liner can’t possibly capture the possible outcome of a War and Peace-sized trade proposal.

"The Republicans are proposing to pay for their giant tax cut to the rich by gutting Medicare and Medicaid," Schumer said. "That's the bombshell this week. That is the nugget that will destroy their whole plan, because Americans are so against those kinds of cuts." In reality, the linkage between the proposed tax cuts and possible cuts to Medicare is more complicated than Schumer described. Schumer’s evidence Schumer’s staff said the "bombshell" is in the Senate Republicans’ budget proposal, unveiled on Sept. 29. The 89-page document would increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. The Medicare and Medicaid cuts Schumer cited come from relatively hard-to-find numbers released by the Senate Budget Committee, which wrote the proposal. To determine the size of the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, Schumer’s office compared the most recent "baseline" spending amounts produced by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and the amounts proposed by the Senate budget document. For Medicare, Schumer’s office calculated that projected spending on the program would be in excess of $8.5 trillion over the next 10 years, if no changes are made from the status quo. The GOP budget, by contrast, projects Medicare spending over the same period to be $8.1 trillion. The difference between the estimate and the GOP budget plan: almost $473 billion, or 5.5 percent of the CBO baseline. For the category that includes Medicaid, CBO produced a baseline spending level of $6.6 trillion over 10 years. In the GOP budget, the equivalent amount is $5.3 trillion over 10 years. That’s a difference of $1.3 trillion. Since Medicaid is estimated to account for 80 percent of that budget line, the specific decline in Medicaid spending would be a bit under $1.1 trillion, or about 17 percent. The Senate Budget Committee responds On Medicare, the Senate Budget Committee did not quibble with Schumer’s number. However, the committee argued that this is not a "cut" because Medicare spending will still rise over the next 10 years -- by about 82 percent over 10 years, instead of 99 percent growth over 10 years under the status quo. Here’s a graph the committee produced: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The committee said this slowdown is justified because CBO says that Medicare’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund -- which covers beneficiaries’ stays at hospitals and other facilities -- will run out by 2025. Making smaller cuts all along would prolong the life of the trust fund and prevent bigger cuts later on, the committee argues. As for Medicaid, the committee said that the budget resolution does not reallocate savings from Medicaid to achieve tax relief. Instead, it projects economic growth spurred by the separately proposed tax overhaul will average 2.6 percent annually, helping pay for tax cuts. Also, the committee argues that widespread benefits from the tax overhaul will leave more money in Americans’ pockets and reduce the need for Medicaid enrollment. Assessing the arguments We should start by noting that the budget proposal -- and especially the tax proposal -- are works in progress and could change before (or if) they are enacted. The Senate Budget Committee has a point that Medicare spending will be going up, just not as fast as it would under the status quo. It also has a point that more modest cuts sooner could stave off bigger cuts later. (Experts have often told us that it’s presumptuous to assume significant economic growth impacts before they materialize.) But we don’t find it unreasonable for Schumer to call cumulative reductions to Medicare and Medicaid spending in the hundreds of billions of dollars "cuts." The reductions below the CBO baseline are indeed in the Senate budget document, which fits with Schumer's words that the GOP is "proposing" them. And an independent analysis by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center backs up the notion that the GOP's cuts are tilted toward richer Americans. That said, he’s glossed over some nuance. The tax proposal is advancing on a different track than the Senate Republicans’ budget plan, and both are at an early stage. So Schumer’s direct linkage between specific tax cuts and Medicare-Medicaid cuts is exaggerated -- and keyed to a hot-button issue for voters. As released, the tax proposal promises to partially offset cuts by repealing other tax breaks, with the rest simply adding to the deficit. And the Senate budget resolution allows the deficit to increase by $1.5 trillion. Since money is fungible, this means that it would be at least as accurate to say that the tax cuts would be paid for by added deficits, rather than cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. In the meantime, Medicare and Medicaid cuts aren’t as inevitable as Schumer suggests. The way things look now, the tax cuts, procedurally, would be easier to pass than the spending cuts. Passage of the budget would tee up a 51-vote Senate threshold for the tax proposal -- easier than the regular 60-vote threshold for Senate business. While the spending cuts could also be passed within that 51-vote bill, the current indications from GOP leaders is that this 51-vote measure would be reserved for taxes, not spending, said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that is generally considered hawkish on deficits. And if spending cuts to Medicare and Medicaid need to go through the regular 60-vote process, they would be highly unlikely to pass in the current Congress, Newton said. Schumer’s office acknowledges such difficulties but adds that an existing "pay-as-you-go" budget law would require mandatory cuts in any case. Newton added, however, that Congress has previously waived this requirement through legislation. "Presumably, Schumer would be interested in ‘wiping the scorecard’ and avoiding those cuts," Newton said. Our ruling Schumer said, "The Republicans are proposing to pay for their giant tax cut to the rich by gutting Medicare and Medicaid." He has a point that the tax proposal includes significant tax cuts and that the Senate Republicans’ budget proposal reduces projected spending levels for Medicare and Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years. However, Schumer has overstated the linkage between the proposed tax and spending cuts. In addition, his decision to highlight Medicare and Medicaid cuts with the vivid word "gutting" leaves the impression that such reductions are a drastic reshaping and are likelier to occur than they actually are.

pomt-11923	"San Juan city council votes unanimously to impeach Trump-hating mayor."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/17/asamericanasapplepieorg/fake-blog-posts-say-san-juan-city-council-impeache/	A fake news story that said the mayor of Puerto Rico’s capital of San Juan was being impeached originated on a website that is part of a network of trolls looking to fool readers. "San Juan city council votes unanimously to impeach Trump-hating mayor," read the headline on an Oct. 15, 2017, post on anews-24.com, as well as some other websites. Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. The post accused San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz of deliberately withholding relief supplies from residents following Hurricane Maria, citing a Sept. 28 New York Post article about logistical problems in Puerto Rico. San Juan’s city council decided in an emergency meeting that they would begin impeachment proceedings, the anews-24.com post said. Cruz made headlines for blasting President Donald Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria, with Trump responding in kind on Twitter. But she isn’t being impeached by anyone, because the article, which is fake, came from a site that parodies real news. It first appeared on the website AsAmericanAsApplePie.org on Oct. 12. AsAmericanAsApplePie.org has all the hallmarks of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers.

pomt-09935	Sixty-two percent of all personal bankruptcies are "caused by medical problems."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/11/chris-dodd/medical-bankruptcy-study-not-clear-cut/	Sen. Chris Dodd wrote about the need for health reform in an op-ed published in a Connecticut newspaper. "Health care costs are rising faster than our economy is growing, crushing family budgets and businesses alike," Dodd wrote. "This week, we learned that 62 percent of all personal bankruptcies were caused by medical problems," he added. Dodd correctly cites a number from a study published in the American Journal of Medicine. The report states without reservation, "Using a conservative definition, 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007 were medical." But that's not the end of the story. We first looked at this issue back in 2007, when then-Sen. Hillary Clinton used 2001 data from the same authors to claim that half of bankruptcies had medical causes. The authors include David Himmelstein of Harvard Medical School and Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School. In our article about Clinton's claim, we noted that only 28.3 percent of bankruptcies were attributed to illness or injury alone. That number grew to 46.2 percent when researchers asked about additional factors such as unpaid medical bills, lost income due to illness, or the mortgage of a home to pay medical bills. In the most recent data, questions were asked slightly differently. But 29 percent of respondents attributed their bankruptcy to medical bills from illness or injury. Asked another way, 32.1 percent said a medical problem suffered by themselves or their spouse caused the bankruptcy. The number rose to 62 percent when people were asked if medical-related issues such as unpaid medical bills, lost income due to illness, or the mortgage of a home to pay medical bills contributed to their bankruptcy. Between 2001 and 2007, Congress overhauled the rules for bankruptcy, making the process more complicated. This drove down the number of overall bankruptcy filings. So the absolute numbers of medical bankruptcies is lower as well. The study doesn't give absolute numbers, so we did the math for you, using the studies' percentages and data from the American Bankruptcy Institute. In 2001, consumer filings were 1.45 million, so medical bankruptcies would have been 670,837 cases. In 2007, consumer bankruptcies were 822,590, so medical bankruptcies would have been 510,828. The authors say that the legislation didn't affect their findings: "New restrictions fall equally on medical and nonmedical bankruptcies, with no preferences for medical debts or sick debtors." That's true, but it's also true that the legislation created a sharp decline in bankruptcy filings. It seems to us that it's possible the legislation deterred bankruptcy so that only people who were really desperate for relief from their debts would file. This could conceivably drive up the proportion of people who filed due to unexpected illness. So we wonder if the 62 percent number is higher because fewer people filed. (For more detail on this issue, check out the economics blogger Megan McCardle of The Atlantic , who has criticized the most recent study.) We should also note that the study appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, but two of the authors belong to the group Physicians for a National Health Program, a group that advocates for a universal, single-payer health program. Finally, we feel another study is worth mentioning that complicates the definition of medical bankruptcies. Ning Zhu of the University of California, Davis, has a 2008 draft study analyzing bankruptcies filed in Delaware in 2003. He found that overspending on household expenditures such as houses and automobiles contributed significantly to bankruptcy filings. His data show that the overspending made people more likely to file for bankruptcy after an illness. That may sound like a "no duh" conclusion, but it raises questions about medical bankruptcies and how they are defined. If people overspend so much that they need everything to go right to meet their financial obligations, and then they get sick, should those bankruptcies properly be categorized as medical bankruptcies? We're not suggesting there's an easy answer here, but it does make the category of "medical bankruptcy" a good bit more complicated. The statistic that we think is most reliable is the percentage of people who say medical bills were the reason for their bankruptcy, and that number is 29 percent. The 2007 study uses a broader definition to conclude that 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies have medical-related causes. Dodd is citing that number correctly. But we find that percentage questionable because it reflects a broad definition of medical issues that contribute to bankruptcy. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-00142	Says Claire McCaskill "has had Chuck Schumer spend more dark money for her than for any senator in America. $16 million and counting!"	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/oct/25/josh-hawley/schumer-pac-has-spent-dark-money-mccaskill-not-muc/	Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., railed against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, citing Kavanaugh’s opinions that restrictions on the flow of "dark money" issue ads are unconstitutional. McCaskill called Kavanaugh’s views on dark money "the determining factor" in voting no on his confirmation. But has she benefited from dark money more than any U.S. senator? Her opponent in Missouri’s U.S. Senate race, Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley, claimed in a tweet on Sept. 25 that McCaskill "has had Chuck Schumer spend more dark money for her than for any senator in America." Hawley claimed that the amount was "$16 million and counting!" "Dark money," or political spending by unknown donors, is hard to track. Dark money groups don’t have to report their expenditures, and often, they don’t. It’s hard to know how much dark money influences election cycles. That ambiguity made Hawley’s claim that McCaskill has received more than $16 million intriguing to us. We decided to investigate further. Senate Majority PAC and Majority Forward When we asked the Hawley campaign how it came up with those numbers, it pointed us to spending by two political action committees: Senate Majority PAC and Majority Forward. Although these two PACs are considered to be controlled by Senate Minority Leader Schumer, D-N.Y., only one is considered by experts to be a dark money group. Senate Majority PAC, established in 2010 to support Democratic U.S. Senate candidates, is considered a super PAC, with the ability to raise unlimited sums of money. The third biggest super PAC in the nation, Senate Majority PAC is required to report its donors, who include George Soros, Bill Maher and Seth MacFarlane, to the Federal Election Commission monthly during election years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. As a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, Majority Forward does not disclose donors, which is why some call it a dark money group, said Brendan Glavin, data and systems manager of the Campaign Finance Institute, in an Oct. 10 email. As of Oct. 22, Majority Forward has spent over $35 million in total during the 2018 election cycle, according to data calculated by the FEC and gathered by the Center for Responsive Politics. It’s mostly spending against Republican candidates; barely over $3 million of this goes in support of Democrats. In Missouri, Majority Forward has spent no money in support of McCaskill but has spent just under $3 million against Hawley. Hawley is Majority Forward’s fifth-highest spending target, and the top seven are all against Republicans. Senate Majority PAC has spent more money against Hawley than for or against any candidate, with $10,793,478 against the Missouri attorney general, as of Oct. 22. McCaskill’s receipt of $3,296,351 ranks her third among Democratic candidates. Senate Majority PAC and Majority Forward do share "office space, staff members and even a president." But that doesn’t mean that Senate Majority PAC is spending dark money, and we cannot count its considerable expenditures in the Missouri race as evidence of dark money per Hawley’s claim. Unaccounted spending Dark money groups don’t always promptly disclose their spending, Anna Massoglia of the Center for Responsive Politics said in an email on Oct. 9. Some dark money spending isn’t reported at all, especially when dark money groups run "issue ads" that don’t explicitly endorse or speak out against one specific candidate. These ads don’t have to be reported to the FEC. Though his numbers were based on reported expenditures, Hawley may be more correct than he thought. Massoglia noted that grassroots organizing, voter mobilization campaigns and digital ads are hard to track and "may be unaccounted for until long after the election is over." This makes extra dark money spent for McCaskill or against Hawley difficult, if not impossible, to account for. Glavin pointed out Majority Forward’s unreported expenditures in Missouri. "According to media reports Majority Forward has been spending money in Missouri since 2017 on get out the vote activities and ads that do not require reporting to the FEC," Glavin said. Evaluating Hawley’s claim Both Massoglia and Glavin told PolitiFact they couldn’t verify Hawley’s claim of $16 million in dark money spent by Schumer on behalf of McCaskill. "The most outside spending reported in FEC disclosures for McCaskill or against Hawley that could be loosely attributed to Schumer as of this date totals just under $15 million at this date," Massoglia said. But she clarified that those contributions included not just Majority Forward but also Senate Majority PAC, which has to disclose its donors. Our ruling Attorney General Hawley claimed that dark money spent on McCaskill’s campaign totals $16 million and counting, the most of any U.S. senator. Hawley is correct that Missouri’s Senate race has been the target of the most spending by Senate Majority PAC on one candidate, as well as the most between Senate Majority and Majority Forward, the two PACs attributable to Schumer. But when we look at just the dark money group, Majority Forward, the numbers tell a different story. Majority Forward hasn’t actually contributed to McCaskill, although it has spent about $3 million opposing Hawley. It is hard to account for all of the dark money spent in an election, and more continues to flow in. But Hawley’s claim was based on reported spending numbers. He’s off by roughly $13 million, considerably inaccurate in assessing the amount of dark money spent on McCaskill’s behalf. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12093	Public schools, colleges and state-funded day care centers "will be made into sanctuaries by Bruce Rauner signing SB 31."	false	/illinois/statements/2017/aug/28/illinois-family-institute/illinois-schools-immigrant-sanctuaries-if-only-the/	As Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a new law defining state and local police officers’ roles in immigration matters, he praised it as a win for public safety and civil rights. "Illinois has been welcoming of immigrants for a long time, and this bill will continue that tradition," Rauner said at an Aug. 28 signing ceremony in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood. "It also makes clear that stopping violent crime will be law enforcement’s mission rather than working on federal prerogatives that a federal court has found illegal." But Rauner’s statements at the signing of the Illinois Trust Act followed several weeks of heated rhetoric from opponents of the measure who saw it as turning Illinois into a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants. His initial expressions of support set off a firestorm of reaction from those who believe it is a threat to public safety. "Governor Bruce Rauner has agreed to sign SB 31 into law — a bill that will make taxpayer funded facilities sanctuaries for people who are here illegally," said an Aug. 19 article on the website of the Illinois Family Institute, a conservative Christian group that headlines its mission as "Boldly Bringing Biblical Perspectives to Public Policy." The article later listed "state-funded schools, including licensed day care centers, pre-schools, and other early learning programs; elementary and secondary schools, and institutions of higher education" as facilities that "will be made into sanctuaries by Bruce Rauner signing SB 31." The criticism quickly went viral on social media. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The outcry from opponents of the new law raised questions similar to those of our Aug. 16 fact-check of Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ criticism of the Chicago Police Department’s policy on immigration enforcement. Though the Trust Act is now law in Illinois, social media remains littered with conjecture about what it means. So we thought it was worth a look at what’s in the law. Old vs. new When originally introduced in the General Assembly, SB 31 contained the language cited in the Illinois Family Institute article. It said that without a "judicial warrant or probable cause of criminal activity… a government official shall not make arrests in the following State-funded facilities or their adjacent grounds: (1) State-funded schools, including licensed day care centers, pre-schools, and other early learning programs; elementary and secondary schools, and institutions of higher education." It also prohibited arrests in state health facilities. That version of the bill was 42 pages long. But it was replaced by an amended version on May 28. That means the language the Illinois Family Institute criticized had been stripped from the bill nearly three months earlier. The version Rauner signed is only four pages long, and all of the language on arrests at public or publicly funded facilities has been deleted. It contains two directives for state and local police: Officers cannot detain people without a warrant from a judge and they can’t "stop, arrest, search, detain, or continue to detain a person solely based on an individual's citizenship or immigration status." State Rep. Emanuel Chris Welch, D-Chicago, who introduced the final version of the bill, said this amounts to "basic due process rights that anyone would want." Language about "safe zones" such as schools was removed at the request of law enforcement, Welch said. Also included in the bill was language explicitly to allow communication between local police and federal authorities, Welch said. Opponents also cite the bill’s prohibition of detaining suspects on administrative warrants from federal immigration authorities that are not issued by judges. These are known as immigration detainers and come from immigration agents, not state or federal judges. Local law enforcement supporters of SB 31 say that this section is necessary so they can earn the trust of immigrant communities. Lake County Sheriff Mark Curran, one of many law enforcement supporters of the bill, explained why in an Aug. 22 column by Mark Brown of the Chicago Sun-Times: "In order to police these communities, protect these communities from the true predators, you have to be able to pull up with lights and all and not have widespread fear and panic among citizens that really have nothing to do with the crime." An Aug. 25 post on the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police blog said the bill "mostly puts into law what is current practice for local police departments: They don’t pull people over only to check their immigration status. They do respond to calls for service when people are the victims of crime or involved in an accident. They do want Illinois residents to call local police if someone is battered, in an accident, or burglarized." Tracing the trouble Welch believes the controversy over the bill heated up after an Aug. 11 appearance by Rauner on Fox news host Bret Baier’s "Special Report." Baier quoted from an old version of the bill and put up graphics containing the "safe haven" language. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Criticism intensified after Rauner appeared Aug. 18 on Chicago public radio station WBEZ’s "Morning Shift" program and voiced support. "It’s supported by law enforcement, it’s supported by the business community, it’s supported by the immigration community," Rauner said. "...It seems very reasonable." When contacted on Aug. 25 about the actual language of the final bill, the author of the Illinois Family Institute article, John Biver, posted a correction. The new language did not temper his opposition. "In truth, the language was not necessary since state and local law enforcement officers are prohibited from making any arrests anywhere in Illinois according to the guidelines of the statute," Bivers wrote in the correction. "Focusing on the ‘state-funded facilities’ only made clearer the offensive nature of the law." Our ruling The Illinois Family Institute said public facilities including schools, colleges and day care centers "will be made into sanctuaries by Bruce Rauner signing SB 31." The original version of the bill prohibited police from making arrests in such facilities, but that language was struck from the version passed by the General Assembly. The new bill contains directives that the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police says merely puts into state statute what most departments already practice. We rate this statement False.

pomt-00091	"Matt Rosendale supports plans that don’t have to cover (pre-existing conditions)."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/31/jon-tester/montanas-matt-rosendale-supports-plans-dont-cover-/	A popular feature of Obamacare is its ban on insurance companies denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. With health care shaping up as a major issue in the midterms, Democrats are now painting Republicans as opponents of this popular protection. "Protections for pre-existing conditions are a matter of life or death," said Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., in a Facebook ad that featured a Montanan with a pre-existing condition. "I’ve fought to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, but Matt Rosendale supports plans that don’t have to cover them." It turns out Rosendale has backed such plans. Short-term plans President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers’ rejiggering of the health care market has led to an increase of cheaper plans with fewer benefits. In August, the Trump administration issued a rule to permit insurance companies to extend the lifespan of short-term insurance plans. These so-called "short-term, limited-duration" plans, which were originally designed to fill temporary gaps in coverage for up to three months, are exempt from the pre-existing coverage rule. Under Trump, temporary plans can now last up to 364 days, and may be renewed up to three times. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, voted to remove a tax penalty that Affordable Care Act applied to Americans who chose not to carry comprehensive coverage. The penalty drops off starting in 2019. These two measures opened the door for consumers to drop coverage altogether, or to buy "short term" plans, without penalty, that may be renewable up to three years and do not have to cover pre-existing conditions. Absent the pre-existing coverage provision, insurers have more leeway in crafting this class of insurance policy. Companies on the short-term market may choose not to insure, or not to renew, an applicant due to health conditions. Or they may charge higher premiums based on health status, gender or other factors. "Carriers offering short-term or limited duration plans may say that they will cover someone that has pre-existing conditions," said Katherine Hempstead, a senior advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. "But then they will actually waive coverage for any health services related to those conditions." Insurance companies may also investigate a policyholder’s claim of illness or injury and make a retroactive finding that their ailment stemmed from a pre-existing condition, and therefore excluded from coverage. Proponents of short-term insurance point to its significantly lower cost, relative to ACA-compliant plans. "Due to these limitations in coverage, short-term policies, not surprisingly, cost less than ACA-compliant major medical health insurance policies," the Kaiser Family Foundation wrote in April analysis. "It is not uncommon to find the cheapest short-term policy priced at 20 percent or less of the premium for the lowest cost (Obamacare)-compliant plan." Rosendale’s support for short-term plans The Tester campaign pointed us to multiple instances in which Rosendale celebrated Trump’s expansion of short-term plans. "We are now getting ready to open up a lot of opportunities in 2019, thankfully, because President Trump signed an executive order extending the duration of short-term plans from 90 to 364 days," Rosendale told Breitbart News Tonight in August. "Again, these are plans that don't have to have all of the Obamacare mandates, which most people don't want." In that same interview, Rosendale hastened to add that he wants to make sure people with pre-existing conditions and others are able to gain coverage. We emailed the Rosendale campaign, which sent us links to news and opinion pieces that related to the candidate’s ideas about health care affordability and price transparency. But they did not specifically address how Rosendale would ensure people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage. An editorial in Montana’s largest newspaper, the Billings Gazette, took Rosendale to task for claiming to support protections for those with pre-existing conditions while endorsing short-term plans. The newspaper cited a study that estimated that a quarter of non-elderly Montana adults have a pre-existing condition that could disqualify them from coverage plans that do not comply with Obamacare. "As the state’s insurance commissioner, Rosendale should know that the policies he supports do opposite of what he promised," the editorial read. "He promotes the short-term policies that can reject Montanans who have pre-existing health conditions." Our ruling Tester said, "Matt Rosendale supports plans that don’t have to cover (pre-existing conditions)." Rosendale supports short-term plans that do not have to cover pre-existing conditions, and he welcomed their expansion under Trump. We rate this True.

pomt-06155	Says in 1944 "we were in debt more than twice as much as we are now."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/18/rush-holt/rush-holt-says-1944-us-had-twice-much-debt-it-does/	Today’s federal debt pales in comparison to what the government owed during World War II, according to U.S. Rep. Rush Holt. The congressman said in a recent telephone town hall meeting that despite facing mounds of debt in 1944, the United States made major investments in education. Yet now, lawmakers are talking about cutting federal aid for education when the nation’s debt is half of what it was 67 years ago, he claimed. "In 1944, this country was in debt like we had never been before or have been since. I'll repeat that. We were in debt more than twice as much as we are now," Holt (D-12th Dist.) said on Dec. 6. The U.S. had more than twice as much debt in 1944 as it does now? Not by any measure. The problem is Holt said debt, when his spokesman said he meant deficit. Here’s the difference between the two: Deficit is the shortfall in a year. If the government spends more than it takes in, the difference is the deficit. Debt is what the government owes from the accumulation of past deficits and surpluses. After many years of spending beyond its means, the federal government’s gross debt is more than $15 trillion. That figure includes debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings, essentially money the government owes itself. Some economists prefer to focus on debt held by the public, since it is what the government has borrowed from outside entities. We’ll compare how both measures of debt have fared between 1944 and now. At the end of fiscal year 1944, as the U.S. was embroiled in World War II, total debt stood at more than $204 billion. Nearly $185 billion of that was held by the public, according to data from the White House Office of Management and Budget. As a percentage of gross domestic product, a yardstick of a nation’s economy, the total debt in 1944 was 97.6 percent and debt held by the public was 88.3 percent. As of Dec. 13, the nation’s total debt amounted to more than $15 trillion, of which nearly $10.4 trillion is publicly held. By the most recent data released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, that debt represents more than 99.2 percent of gross domestic product and nearly 68.5 percent of gross domestic product, respectively. So, by those measures, Holt’s claim is off. Thomas Seay, a spokesman for Holt, said the statement was "intended as a reference to the annual U.S. budget deficit as a percentage of GDP – that is, to how quickly America was falling into debt." In 1944, the deficit measured up to 22.7 percent of the nation’s economy, according to the Office of Management and Budget. In fiscal year 2011, the deficit was 8.7 percent of gross domestic product, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Still, as Gerald Lynch, a professor of economics at Purdue University, noted in an email, "If the congressman wanted to say we were racking up debt then at a rate twice what we are today, then that would be ok to refer to the deficit to gdp ratio. To say that we were in twice as much debt is not correct." Our ruling Holt claimed that in 1944 "we were in debt more than twice as much as we are now." By any measure of the debt, the congressman’s statement is wrong. A spokesman said Holt meant to talk about the deficit but he used the word debt.. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14714	Guantanamo has "never been a key component of ISIS or al-Qaida propaganda."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/dec/30/stephen-hayes/guantanamo-key-component-terrorist-propaganda/	Supporters of closing the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center, including President Barack Obama, often refer to the military prison’s existence as a major recruitment tool for terrorist groups. The theory is that terrorist groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) can rally potential followers by highlighting alleged human rights abuses against suspected terrorists held at the prison. But Weekly Standard senior editor Stephen Hayes said this is flat-out wrong. Guantanamo has "never been a key component of ISIS or al-Qaida propaganda, and yet the president is insisting on moving forward and closing it," Hayes said on Fox News Sunday Dec. 27. We decided to get to the bottom of this question. When we reached out to Hayes, he said there’s no question that Guantanamo features in some terrorist propaganda, but he emphasized that it’s not a "key component." Experts we spoke with generally agreed. Scant mentions Hayes pointed us in the direction of Thomas Joscelyn, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an expert in counterterrorism. "Guantanamo plays an insignificant role in the jihadis' propaganda" Joscelyn told PunditFact. "It is rarely mentioned." Joscelyn’s conclusion is based on statistical analyses of keywords used in ISIS and al-Qaida propaganda, which he has followed closely for the past decade. Over the years, he has amassed a database of messages, videos, transcripts of audio statements and publications produced in multiple languages, predominantly Arabic. For example, Joscelyn found just four mentions of Guantanamo out of 12 issues — or more than 700 pages in English — of ISIS’ monthly magazine, Dabiq. Not one article included Guantanamo as a main theme. None of the four mentions were in a recruitment context; one was in a footnote. Other topics dominate, such as the fight against the "Zionist-Crusaders," establishing the caliphate, the fate of Palestine, U.S. military airstrikes targeting ISIS, and American occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. Researchers at the Brookings Institution also conducted an analysis of terrorist propaganda earlier in 2015 and published their findings in the respected Lawfare blog. Even though their review only included material that was in English or came with a translation, they came to a similar conclusion as Joscelyn. Overall, the authors found that ISIS has rarely used Guantanamo as a propaganda tool, and al-Qaida uses the prison a lot less frequently than it used to, though the group didn’t use it much to begin with. When groups did mention Guantanamo, it was often listed alongside other controversial facilities, like the now defunct Abu Ghraib prison, and other grievances concerning the United States. "Guantanamo has never played a big role in any terrorist group’s propaganda compared to the issues that really animate those groups," the authors wrote. "So while it’s easy to find examples of terrorist leaders mentioning and denouncing Guantanamo, these were never the major themes of jihadi propaganda but were, at most, supporting arguments." One expert told us Hayes’ claim is an overstatement. Max Abrahms, a political science professor at Northeastern University, said Hayes is downplaying Guantanamo’s significance in propaganda. For example, al-Qaida’s Inspire magazine has prominently featured the prison, such as the fall 2010 issue, which included accounts from former detainees. He added that in recent ISIS’ beheading videos shared widely on social media, the terrorists often dress the hostages in orange jumpsuits, which many people assume is a reference to the iconic Guantanamo detainee uniforms. Joscelyn disputed this argument, saying that many prisons use similar jumpsuits and Guantanamo no longer uses those uniforms. Further, these so-called "Jihadi John" videos rarely mention Guantanamo. The orange jumpsuit is likely a visual reference to Abu Ghraib, rather than Guantanamo, dating back to the first beheading video by al-Qaida in Iraq, said J.M. Berger, a nonresident fellow at Brookings. In any case, Guantanamo is not necessarily an effective recruiting tool, Abrahms added. In fact, it might be less valuable in terms of propaganda now than it used to be because Guantanamo was associated with President George W. Bush, while it’s widely known that Obama wants to close the prison. The general topic of Muslim religious and political prisoners is popular among jihadists and can be used in recruitment, said Berger, author of Jihad Joe: Americans Who Go to War in the Name of Islam and ISIS: The State of Terror. Terrorist group members can monitor related social media accounts and websites looking for potential recruits. For example, a former Guantanamo detainee runs one of the most important English-language websites on this topic, the London-based Islamic prisoner advocacy website CAGE, and they cover Guantanamo issues in some detail. "Guantanamo has not been a massive focus in jihadist propaganda, but it does feature in recruiting," Berger said. "ISIS and al-Qaida recruiters can use it as a wedge issue when approaching someone who is not fully radicalized." He added, though, that U.S. counterterrorism action, particularly drone strikes, are arguably much more important to recruitment and definitely more important to propaganda than Guantanamo. Our ruling Hayes said, Guantanamo has "never been a key component of ISIS or al-Qaida propaganda." Experts told us that Hayes’ point has merit. Analyses of jihadist propaganda materials show that Guantanamo is rarely mentioned, especially compared to other grievances against the United States, like military airstrikes. Al-Qaida uses Guantanamo less frequently now than it used to, though it was never a primary focus of their propaganda. Because he specified that Guantanamo is not a "key component" of jihadist propaganda, we rate Hayes’ statement True.	None	Stephen Hayes	None	None	None	2015-12-30T16:31:54	2015-12-27	['None']

pomt-07769	"The president promised to close the space gap, but he now seems intent on repeating the events that created the space gap in the first place -- putting in place a new rocket design and then trying to underfund the effort..."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/23/bill-posey/rep-bill-posey-criticizes-obama-underfunding-nasa-/	President Barack Obama dubbed this period "our generation’s Sputnik moment" in his 2011 State of the Union address when he called for job-creating investments in high-tech areas. But when it comes to the space race, one Florida congressman is blasting the president as "ceding American leadership in space to China and Russia." In a press release responding to Obama's $3.8 trillion budget proposal unveiled on Feb. 14, 2011, Republican Rep. Bill Posey, whose district covers a portion of Florida's Space Coast, decried cuts to certain portions of NASA's budget, even though the agency's budget has remained pretty much unchanged from 2010. Obama's budget allots $18.7 billion to NASA for the 2012 fiscal year, the same amount received this fiscal year. However, Obama's plan shifts the money around, increasing funding for projects like climate change research and reducing the budget for other space projects. (A description of the administration’s NASA budget summary can be read here.) "After the administration let NASA flounder for the past two years, a flawed NASA authorization bill was finally agreed to and signed into law," Posey wrote in a press release. "Now the administration is proposing to ignore this law, placing a higher priority on global warming research and making cuts to the next-generation launch vehicle." Posey's press release went on: "Over two years ago, the president promised to close the space gap, but now he seems intent on repeating the events that created the space gap in the first place -- putting in place a new rocket design and then trying to underfund the effort, ensuring that it will never happen and ceding American leadership in space to China and Russia." With the final flight of shuttle Discovery scheduled for Feb. 24 and only two more shuttle flights left after that, we decided to check the facts of the last portion of Posey’s statement. Did Obama promise two years ago "to close the space gap?" Has a new rocket design been put into place, and is it properly funded? Obama on space During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama made a stop in Titusville, just west of the Kennedy Space Center, where he spoke to an animated crowd about his goals for NASA. "Let me be clear we cannot cede our leadership in space," Obama said. "That's why I'm going to close the gap and ensure that our space program doesn't suffer when the shuttle goes out of service. We may extend an additional shuttle launch. We’re going to work with Sen. Bill Nelson to fund at least one more flight beyond 2010 ... by continuing to support NASA funding by speeding the development of the shuttle's successor, by making sure that all those who work in the industry in Florida do not lose their jobs because we cannot afford to lose their expertise." (A video of the speech can be found here.) The president returned to the area on April 15, 2010, giving a speech at the Kennedy Space Center where he expanded on his plans for NASA. "The bottom line is, nobody is more committed to manned spaceflight, to human exploration of space than I am," Obama told the crowd, according to a New York Times report. He added: "Step by step, we will push the boundaries, not only of where we can go, but what we can do. In short, 50 years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time." So, Posey is right about Obama's campaign pledge to "close the space gap," and the president himself has talked of his desire for American astronauts to aim for travel to Mars by the mid 2030s. Constellation project Posey press secretary George Cacela said the congressman's statements about funding for a new rocket-design were based on the troubled Constellation project. The law that Posey is citing is the 2010 NASA Authorization Act, which mandated that the space agency build a heavy-lift rocket called Ares by 2016 with an $11.5 billion budget. Constellation started in 2005 under former President George W. Bush's administration. With the space shuttle being phased out after 30 years, Constellation's goal was to return to the moon by 2020 and set up a base camp there in future years. A series of Ares rockets and the Orion crew capsule were part of the original Constellation plan. However, the project, as described in this Jan. 14, 2004, speech by Bush, never received the full $100 billion funding it was originally promised, resulting in delayed work and mounting costs. A 2007 report by the Government Accountability Office, before Obama was elected, also criticized the way funding was being handled for the Constellation project and other goals outlined in Bush’s 2004 space policy. "The need for NASA to implement the vision in a fiscally prudent and effective manner cannot be overemphasized given the competing fiscal demands facing the federal government and an already troubling funding profile projected for human spaceflight activities," the report notes. "We have issued a number of reports that touch on various aspects of retiring the space shuttle and transitioning its assets and people to exploration activities. These reports have questioned the affordability of the exploration program, NASA’s acquisition strategy for the development of new space vehicles, agency-wide contract management and workforce planning for current and future agency needs." What was Obama's role? In May 2009, Obama convened a panel headed by Norman Augustine, a former Lockheed Martin executive, to review the feasibility of current and future NASA projects like Constellation. In an October 2009 report, the committee deemed that Constellation would need an additional $45 billion to get back on track. In addition, an August 2009 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, "Constellation Program Cost and Schedule Will Remain Uncertain Until a Sound Business Case Is Established," also found flaws in previous funding for the Orion and Ares projects. "While the agency has already obligated more than $10 billion in contracts, at this point NASA does not know how much Ares I and Orion will ultimately cost, and will not know until technical and design challenges have been addressed," the report states. The Obama administration pulled the plug on the back-to-the-moon project by eliminating funding for it from the president’s 2011 fiscal year budget proposal. Instead, Obama recommended that NASA reconfigure the Constellation's Orion crew capsule to serve as a reserve spacecraft for the International Space Station. "This Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep-space missions," Obama said in his April 2010 speech at the Kennedy Space Center. In 2010, when Congress passed the NASA Authorization Act, $2.6 billion was appropriated for the Ares heavy lift-rocket, and $1.4 billion for the Orion crew capsule. Under Obama's current budget proposal the projects would receive less money -- $1.8 billion for the rocket and $1 billion for the Orion project. Even before Obama released his latest budget proposal, NASA administrators stated in a January 2011 report that the timeline and budget in the 2010 NASA Authorization Act were not sufficient to complete the Orion crew capsule and the Ares heavy-lift rocket projects by their 2016 targets. The 22-page report stated: • "It is important to note that the (Orion) project will be operating in a cost-constrained environment. The three-year authorized funding level represents a significant reduction." • "While NASA will work as expeditiously as possible to meet the 2016 goal, NASA does not believe this goal is achievable based on a combination of the current funding profile estimate..." Our ruling So back to our questions: Did Obama promise two years ago "to close the space gap?" Has a new rocket design been put into place, and is it properly funded? Posey is correct that Obama said he intended to close the space gap, and he supported man living and working in space. But, the Obama administration has decreased funding for the space-flight vessels in favor of increasing funding for climate research projects. However, NASA's funding issues did not suddenly emerge under the Obama administration. A 2007 report from the GAO projected an "already troubling funding profile projected for human spaceflight activities." Even NASA has said it can't complete the projects with the current budget constraints. So while Obama has reduced spending, the projects in question have long been struggling to get adequate support to move forward. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06299	Solyndra "had robots that whistled Disney songs. I'm not kidding."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/nov/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-failed-solar-company-solyndra-had/	When a presidential candidate says a controversial solar factory had robots that whistled Disney songs, then says, "I'm not kidding," we just can't resist. Really? We've checked other recent claims about Solyndra, the once-hot solar panel manufacturer that won $535 million in federal loan guarantees, then collapsed into bankruptcy court this year. But only this one had us humming a merry tune. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who is seeking the Republican nomination, talked about the robots to distinguish between his private sector experience and government largesse in a recent speech to conservatives in Washington. "You see in the private sector, as you know, you have no choice about balancing budgets. You either balance your budget, or you go broke. And you spend every dollar like it's your own, because it is. Now someone should have told that to Solyndra. "The federal government gave them a $535 million startup loan to build a factory in Fremont, Calif. The footprint of their facility covered five baseball fields. They had robots that whistled Disney songs. I'm not kidding. They had, what was described as, spa-like showers with liquid crystal displays that told you what the water temperature was. The company headquarters was called, the 'Taj Mahal' of office buildings. "That's how government starts a business. Now let me compare Solyndra with Staples, a company that I helped get started in a small way. Our headquarters was located in the back of an empty food warehouse. We got used office furniture, old Naugahyde chairs. You actually had to be kind of an athlete to get out of them once you sat into them. Yet every penny we had went into selling and attracting customers. That's the difference between the private sector and government, fiscal responsibility." The Disney reference planted an irresistible image of Snow White's dwarfs stacking solar panels. We asked Romney's campaign for evidence for his claim. Spokesman Ryan Williams provided us with a Bloomberg article from Sept. 28, 2011: "Solyndra plant had whistling robots, spa showers." It began: "The glass-and-metal building that Solyndra LLC began erecting alongside Interstate 880 in Fremont, California, in September 2009 was something the Silicon Valley area hadn’t seen in years: a new factory. "It wasn’t just any factory. When it was completed at an estimated cost of $733 million, including proceeds from a $535 million U.S. loan guarantee, it covered 300,000 square feet, the equivalent of five football fields. It had robots that whistled Disney tunes, spa-like showers with liquid-crystal displays of the water temperature, and glass-walled conference rooms. "'The new building is like the Taj Mahal,' John Pierce, 54, a San Jose resident who worked as a facilities manager at Solyndra, said in an interview." Later in the story were more robot details. "Robots that resembled 'a big freezer with wheels' maneuvered around the factory transporting panels from one machine to another, said George Garma, 49, a former Solyndra equipment maintenance technician from Fremont. The Disney tunes alerted workers to the robots’ presence." We chatted with Pierce, the facilities manager, who now works at a California university, and Myron Moreno, Solyndra's director of automation, who's since picked up a job at another solar company. They explained that at an automated plant like Solyndra's, when stacks of panels need to be moved around the factory, a machine called an "automated guided vehicle" does the work. It's basically a driverless forklift. Just like a forklift, it sounds an alarm when it moves to alert workers to stay out of the way. (You can see them at work in this Solyndra video.) Versions of the vehicles have been around since the 1950s, according to the American Society of Safety Engineers. Their main benefit is that they reduce labor costs. But the incessant beep-beep-beeping can drive workers nuts — and sometimes they tune it out, presenting a safety hazard. So vehicle makers have experimented with other sounds to make sure the alarms get heard. For example, melodies. Moreno said the new factory used about 10 automated guided vehicles from equipment manufacturers Murata and Savant, in two sizes. One carried about 1,000 pounds, the other about 2,000 pounds. The Japanese Murata vehicles came preloaded with a beeping noise and music. The other machines Solyndra equipped with an alarm box that included music. "They gave you a menu, so we had each one playing a different medley," Moreno said. "Any time they're moving, it's preferable to have some music versus the alarming sound. I've been in factories all over the U.S., and that's the typical thing." Of course, even the wordless music had its downside: Songs could get stuck in your head, Moreno said. So they avoided the better-known movie soundtracks, like E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial and Raiders of the Lost Ark, he said. It was a relief, Moreno said, that some of the tunes were Japanese folk songs. "Those weren't too bad, because nobody knew what those were," Moreno said. What about Disney songs? Neither Pierce or Moreno specifically recalled any. Our ruling We were heartened that Romney was able to quickly provide a source for his information about Solyndra's factory. But as an example of wasteful spending, "robots that whistled Disney songs," doesn't quite hold up. Automated guided vehicles are common in warehouses and factories, as a labor-saving device. Some of them come preloaded with melodies as an alternative to beep-beep-beep — to boost workers' attention to them, and thus safety. The Solyndra vehicles may have played some Disney tunes along with their movie medleys and Japanese folk songs, but it wasn't their most memorable feature. We rate Romney's claim Half True.

pomt-15089	The government "made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard" for religious reasons.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/17/mike-huckabee/did-ft-hood-shooter-get-keep-his-beard-religious-g/	In the days before the second Republican presidential debate, candidate Mike Huckabee flew to the side of Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who went to jail rather than issue same-sex marriage licenses. Davis said it violated her religious beliefs to put her name to the forms that would allow such marriages. During the debate, Huckabee said Davis represented an example of judicial tyranny. "We made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard," Huckabee said. "We made accommodations to the detainees at Gitmo — I’ve been to Gitmo, and I’ve seen the accommodations that we made to the Muslim detainees who killed Americans. "You’re telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected Democrat county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky? What else is it other than the criminalization of her faith and the exaltation of the faith of everyone else who might be a Fort Hood shooter or a detainee at Gitmo?" In this fact-check, we’ll focus on Huckabee’s claim about the Fort Hood killer’s beard and if he was allowed to keep it for religious reasons. The legal fight over Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan’s beard went back and forth. Ultimately, his jailers forcibly shaved him, but for a time, he was allowed to keep it. Trying the Fort Hood killer In November 2009, Army psychiatrist Hasan, an American of Palestinian descent, opened fire in a room at Fort Hood where soldiers were getting medical check-ups before deploying to Afghanistan. Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 30. As per Army regulations, until that point Hasan was clean-shaven. He began growing his beard while he awaited trial. According to the New York Times, he told his lawyers that he expected to die and thought it would violate his Muslim faith to die without one. The military prosecutors objected, saying the beard would make it harder for witnesses to identify Hasan. The trial judge, Col. Gregory Gross, objected on the grounds that the military code requires that everyone, with very few exceptions, be clean-shaven. The judge said that having a beard would disrupt the court proceedings. He held Hasan in contempt six times. The battle over Hasan’s beard was a snag that blocked his trial from moving forward. In September 2012, the judge ordered that Hasan be forcibly shaved. That’s no small matter. It takes a team of soldiers to restrain the prisoner and shave him while someone videotapes the entire process to guard against the undue use of force. Hasan appealed on the basis that the judge’s order violated his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In December, a military appeals panel ruled that it was up to commanding officers, not a judge, to enforce the dress code. The panel also removed Judge Gross, saying that he could no longer appear unbiased. The panel specifically did not address whether religious freedom laws gave Hasan the right to a beard. "We need not and do not decide if and how RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) might apply to Appellant's beard," the judges wrote. "Should the next military judge find it necessary to address Appellant's beard, such issues should be addressed and litigated anew." The second trial judge allowed a bearded Hasan to attend the court hearings. In August 2013, Hasan was convicted on 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. He was sentenced to death. Hasan went to the detention barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he joined the handful of other soldiers on death row. In September 2013, a year after the legal fight began, an Army spokesman said that Hasan had been forcibly shaved. Our ruling Huckabee said that legal rulings allowed Hasan the Fort Hood shooter to keep his beard on religious grounds. While an appeals court did overrule the initial trial judge who had ordered that Hasan be forcibly shaved, that ruling did not affirm that Hasan had the right based on his religion. Instead, it said that it wasn’t the judge’s job to enforce the military dress code, which requires personnel to be clean shaven. When Hasan was convicted and sent to Fort Leavenworth, he was forcibly shaved. Hasan did keep his beard for a while, but ultimately, no accommodation was made for religious reasons.

pomt-08674	Due to the war in Iraq, "4,400 Americans are dead, 30,000 severely wounded and more than 100,000 are suffering from serious health problems related to post traumatic stress syndrome."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/11/ron-paul/rep-ron-paul-says-4400-americans-were-killed-iraq-/	From the Oval Office where President George W. Bush announced the United States would invade Iraq, Barack Obama said Aug. 31 that "the American combat mission in Iraq has ended. Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country." U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Surfside, who opposed the Iraq war from the start, was unimpressed, saying in a Sept. 1 statement that the war cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars and many casualties. "Forty-four hundred Americans are dead, 30,000 severely wounded, and more than 100,000 are suffering from serious health problems related to post traumatic stress syndrome," Paul said. "This alone should tell us that it was not worth the investment and the needless sacrifice of our young people and the taxpayers." We're not weighing the worthiness of the investment. But we wondered whether Paul correctly recapped the conflict's toll of U.S. dead and wounded. Rachel Mills, Paul's press secretary, first pointed us to data on U.S. casualties in Iraq kept by GlobalSecurity.org, a nonpartisan company that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security. As of December 2009, 4,287 American troops were killed in Iraq, according to GlobalSecurity, which relies on the U.S. Department of Defense for such data. "There are at least several hundred contractor deaths," Mills said, citing a Wikipedia web page. "So, the 4,400 American dead is spot on." We checked with the Defense Department, which updates daily the number of U.S. casualties and wounded military personnel as a result of the Iraq war. As of Sept. 3, 4,408 American troops had died as a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, including casualties that occurred in the Arabian Sea and Saudi Arabia, among related locations. Include civilian casualties and the department's death toll totals 4,421. Of them, 3,492 were killed in action. About 31,930 troops had been wounded in action by the same date, according to the Defense Department. But were those troops "severely wounded," as Paul says? More than half — 17,953 — were returned to duty within 72 hours, according to department. John Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity, told us: "I don't know if you can gauge the meaning of severe," but agreed that if a combatant returns to duty within 72 hours, their injuries probably aren't. Next, we turned to Paul's reference to post-traumatic stress disorder. Mills of Paul's office first cited a June 7 post on CNN.com per a study by Army researchers finding that up to 31 percent of soldiers returning from combat in Iraq experience PTSD or depression. The researchers analyzed mental health surveys taken from more than 13,000 Army and National Guard service members between 2004 and 2007, both three and 12 months after they returned to the United States. Mills also referred to a April 2005 Salon.com story — posted on GlobalSecurity.org — about how many U.S. soldiers have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11. "Well over 1 million U.S. troops have fought in the wars since Sept. 11, 2001, according to Pentagon data released to Salon," according to the story. "So if 31 percent came back with PTSD, than that would be over 300,000," Mills said. But that calculation includes U.S. troops who were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, while Paul's statement is limited to returnees from Iraq. Elaine Lainez, a spokeswoman at the Defense Department, told us there have been 65,784 cases of PTSD among troops who served in both wars, far less than the total cited by Paul for Iraq alone. Lainez said that service members are diagnosed with PTSD after having "at least two outpatient visits or one or more hospitalizations." However, the Department of Veteran Affairs, which has a looser criteria for assessing PTSD cases, pegs the toll much higher. Jessica Jacobsen, a spokeswoman at the Dallas division of the department, told us that as of March 31, a total 162,050 veterans were seen at a VA clinic for potential PTSD following their return from Iraq or Afghanistan. Jacobsen said she couldn't tell how many are suffering from serious health problems, as Paul says, because the severity of each veteran's condition is a "case-by-case account." Evan Kanter, a psychiatrist at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System who specializes in the health effects of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the Defense Department's records are "a very limited source." He also called the VA's estimate — more than 100,000 — a "very conservative number." Pike agreed, because the VA doesn't count those who never report symptoms that could be related to PTSD. Kanter pointed us to a 2008 study by the RAND Corp., which estimates that approximately 300,000 of 1.64 million troops who deployed for the Afghanistan or Iraq wars suffer from PTSD. RAND based its conclusion on a telephone study of 1,965 previously deployed troops, finding that 14 percent screened positive for PTSD. The definitive number on how many troops have suffered from the disorder? "Who knows?" Pike said. "If you think you've got yourself a hard and fast number, you haven't studied it long enough." Pike said Paul is "definitely in the ballpark." Where does that leave us? True, more than 4,400 Americans are dead as a result of the Iraq War. Also true: about 30,000 military personnel had been wounded as of September — though Paul's statement that all of them were "severely" injured isn't supported by Department of Defense data indicating more than half returned to active duty within 72 hours. Paul's office had no immediate comment when we followed up on this point. Quantifying how many people are suffering from PTSD is trickier, and none of the numbers we saw — including the figure Mills pointed us to — separated the Iraq PTSD cases from those resulting from duty in Afghanistan. But given the wide range of the government's own measures, Paul's 100,000 figure shakes out as reasonable. We rate his statement as Half True.

pomt-09007	Says Gov. Rick Perry is “by far and away the highest-paid state employee on an hourly basis.”	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/jul/12/bill-white/white-citing-available-schedule-says-perry-far-and/	Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor, said last month that GOP Gov. Rick Perry lazes about. Hold that thought: White told reporters in Austin June 17 that “if you divide the hours (Perry) works in by the amount he’s paid, then he’s by far and away the highest-paid state employee on an hourly basis.” UPDATE, July 13, 2010: After we published this article, an Austin reader pointed out that the equation White spelled out wouldn't generate a dollars-per-hour estimate at all. Dividing hours worked by dollars paid, as White suggests, leads to a figure for the number of hours worked for every dollar paid. In this case, that's a very small number. Over all, this detail doesn't affect the substance of this article or our rating of White's statement. Still, we wish we'd caught this twist in the first place. White’s campaign cited Perry’s public schedule for January through May and its calculation that Perry accumulated 145.5 hours of scheduled events in the period. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in an e-mail: “We followed (Perry’s) state schedule and counted 1 hour for events, 1/2 hour for phone calls, 1/2 hour for press conferences. Most busy CEOs get in and out and get things done. Church was not counted.” Bacon added that she’s heard Mack Brown, head coach of the University of Texas football team, is the highest-paid state employee, “but you can bet he works a lot more than seven hours a week.” We’re not testing Brown’s work ethic, but we’re game for White’s charge, which his campaign based on dividing five months’ of Perry’s $150,000 annual salary—about $62,500—by 146 (rounding up from 145.5 hours of state-scheduled events as listed on his schedule), resulting in an “hourly” pay rate of about $428. Made sense for Bacon to mention the UT coach, who’s widely known for having the top salary among state workers, at $5.1 million. Presuming a 40-hour work week, Brown’s hourly rate breaks out to nearly $2,452. Presuming a 60-hour week--head football coaches work notoriously long hours--Brown’s hourly rate drops to nearly $1,635. If Brown improbably worked around the clock, his hourly rate would be $582, still more than the hourly rate White calculates for Perry. Another UT coach and the head football coaches at Texas A&M University and Texas Tech University each make $1.5 million or more, as noted in a 2010 chart compiled by the online Texas Tribune listing the highest-paid state workers. Assuming each works 60 hours a week, their salaries translate to hourly rates of $481 or more. Then again, the argument is often made that college coaches like Brown, whose salary derives from sports revenues, are in a special category. What about other state employees? Separately, we asked the state comptroller’s office to break out the state’s highest-paid workers, including Perry. The agency, citing salary figures as of April, generated a list taking into account about 157,000 state workers, excluding college and university employees, which it does not track. The compilation suggests Perry’s annual salary is less than what the state pays 313 other workers, topped by Britt Harris, chief investment officer of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, at $480,000. We called the system and inquired into how many hours Harris works. Spokesman Howard Goldman said “well over 40” hours a week. Assuming Harris works an average of 60 hours weekly, his hourly rate runs about $154. If he’s averaging 50 hours a week, the rate would be about $185. Perry’s hourly wage is more than double those amounts, per White’s calculation of his working hours based on events posted on his official schedule. This begs the question: Is the schedule an accurate indicator of how much time Perry spends on the job? That’s a toughie because the schedule is far from complete, making it hard for anyone to gauge how the governor spends his time. In 2008, the Austin American-Statesman reviewed the calendars for the state’s top six statewide elected officials covering January through March of that year. The newspaper said that while the officials’ calendars “did not prove to be comprehensive accountings of their working hours, they yielded glimpses of how the officials spent their time.” Perry had state-related events on fewer than 40 days during the period, the newspaper reported, counting a parade, a coach's salute and two Washington dinners--and he had no state-scheduled events on 31 weekdays. A Perry spokesman at the time, Robert Black, was quoted noting that Perry had just assumed the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association and started promoting his book saluting the Boy Scouts. “Both these events took up a considerable amount of the governor's time,” Black said, “but working hard to elect more conservative governors across the nation and espousing the values and virtues of the Boy Scouts of America is well worth the effort.” Of late, Bacon told us in an e-mail, it’s up to Perry to prove he’s been busy with state business in the many hours he did not have scheduled events. She said: “When you're a CEO, you can't have last-minute meetings. Things have to be planned in advance.” We didn’t hear back from Perry’s campaign or his state office. But we came across this reaction to the White campaign calculation from Perry, as reported by Hearst Newspapers columnist Peggy Fikac: “If they've made anybody that can outwork me yet, please introduce me to him or her. Texans know I am mobile, I am agile, and I'm going to continue doing work for 'em 24/7. Just because it doesn't show up on my schedule doesn't mean I'm not out working for the people of the state of Texas, thank you very much." Bacon spotted the same Perry reaction, which she termed “truly priceless” in an e-mail. “He is ‘mobile’ and ‘agile?’ What does that have to do with working seven hours a week while drawing a full-time salary? Sounds more like something related to jogging ... and shooting coyotes,” wrote Bacon -- a reference to Perry’s declaration this year that he shot a coyote while jogging. Seeking historical perspective, we called chiefs of staff to the governors preceding Perry, George W. Bush and Ann Richards. Joe M. Allbaugh, who was Gov. Bush’s chief of staff, said Bush’s official schedule didn’t reflect his work days, which often ran from early in the morning into evenings, especially if lawmakers were in session. “This is foolish and hogwash for the White campaign to draw this type of comparison,” Allbaugh said. “All public officials put in more hours than they’re paid. It doesn’t matter if you’re Democratic, Republican or Martian, your public service is not for the money.” We asked Allbaugh, who backs Perry’s re-election, if it’s possible Perry enjoys a lot of down time. Allbaugh replied: “I don’t know if it’s possible to do that or not. People need to remember, that person is governor full time... Hurricanes, oil spills, they don’t call up (from) 8 to 5 (saying:) ‘By the way, is the governor in?’” Next, we reached Austin lobbyist John Fainter, who was a chief of staff for Richards when she was governor and earlier served as secretary of state with Gov. Mark White. Fainter, who has contributed to Perry's campaign kitty, said governors don’t ever get away from work. “Things come up,” Fainter said. “The schedule is largely irrelevant as to the time they actually spend on duties.” We get it: Texas governors don’t punch time clocks. Where does that leave White’s statement that Perry is “far and away” the highest-paid state worker on an hourly basis? For starters, Perry’s hourly wage as calculated by White is less than what we calculated for several state employees (coaches). Most importantly, he assumes the public schedule released by Perry’s office accounts for all his working hours. But according to the Statesman’s previous reporting as well as two veterans of the governor’s office, such schedules are woefully incomplete. White could have sought a better accounting of how the governor spends his time without cobbling together comparisons that don’t hold up. Pants on Fire!

pomt-02610	Says Colorado food stamp recipients can use ATMs to get cash to buy marijuana.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/24/brian-kilmeade/foxs-kilmeade-colo-food-stamp-recipients-can-turn-/	We are a scant few weeks into the era of legal recreational pot in Colorado and so far, there are no reports of increased driving accidents or violence. But Fox News found a different point of concern. Brian Kilmeade, co-host of Fox and Friends, honed in on the connection between pot and food stamps, otherwise known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. "Can people collecting food stamps in Colorado add marijuana to their shopping list?" Kilmeade asked. "Right now, the answer is yes. Because there’s nothing blocking using government benefit cards in pot shop ATMs." In this fact-check, we are looking specifically at Kilmeade’s claim that people receiving food stamps in Colorado can use an ATM to get cash that they can use in turn to purchase marijuana. We reached out to Fox News and got no response. Federal and Colorado law says that food stamps must be used for food (hat tip here to Media Matters). The U.S. Department of Agriculture says "SNAP benefits can never be withdrawn as cash." So if SNAP benefits can’t be withdrawn as cash, how can people use them at Colorado pot shops? They can’t. Colorado gives SNAP recipients a Quest Card, which is basically a debit card. It’s a cover-all card used by people who sign up for SNAP, low-income energy assistance, welfare (Temporary Aid for Needy Families or TANF) or any other aid they might qualify for. People receiving benefits from those other programs can use their Quest Card at an ATM to get cash. But not SNAP, and the card knows the difference, officials with the Colorado Department of Human Services told us. "The card is programmed to distinguish between a cash withdrawal for TANF, or any other cash benefit, and a food purchase with SNAP dollars," said Dan Drayer, the department’s communications director. "There’s no way they can get SNAP benefits from a machine." Kilmeade would have been more correct if he had focused on another federal benefit -- Temporary Assistance For Needy Families, or TANF. Nothing would prevent a person with a Quest Card with TANF money on it from using the card in any ATM to get cash, which they could then use to buy marijuana. Two final points. First, marijuana stores do have ATMs. "Due to the lack of access to banking services for cannabis businesses, purchases generally must be done in cash," said Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, a trade group. Second, a SNAP benefit card will only work with foods that are the approved by the USDA. A rumor that food stamps could be used to buy marijuana brownies falls flat because no food that can be eaten in the store, laced with pot or otherwise, would be on the government’s list. Our ruling Fox News’ Kilmeade said ATMs give food stamp recipients in Colorado a way to buy marijuana. The technology behind government electronic benefit cards blocks that. While the card could have cash value from another program such as TANF, no ATM would dispense cash based on a person’s food stamp allowance. We rate the claim False.

pomt-02208	Says North Carolina Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis "called Obamacare ‘a great idea.’ "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/22/kay-hagan/kay-hagan-says-gop-rival-thom-tillis-called-obamac/	In her quest to win a second term, Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., has been hit hard by attacks over her vote for Obamacare. In a recent radio ad, she fights back, charging that her potential Republican opponent, state House Speaker Thom Tillis, actually said he liked the health care law. Here’s a portion of the narration in Hagan’s ad: "Politicians. These days, you’ve got to watch them close. Real close. Here’s Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis describing Obamacare: (Audio clip of Tillis) ’It’s a great idea.’ That’s right. Thom Tillis called Obamacare ‘a great idea.’ That was on the Bill LuMaye Show just this February. You can look it up." If true, that would be problematic for his chances of winning a Republican primary, since Tillis, considered the establishment conservative in the race, is facing opponents who boast of their uncompromising opposition to the law. Is the ad correct that Tillis is a closet fan of Obamacare, even though his own campaign website calls for a "full repeal" of the law and labels it "a cancer on our national economy and it threatens the quality of every American's health care"? As it turns out, Hagan’s ad uses just half of the quote. Let’s go to the audiotape. Tillis made his comment on the Raleigh, N.C.-based talk show hosted by Bill LuMaye on Feb. 6, 2014. Here’s some of the conversation that preceded and followed the snippet used in Hagan’s ad. LuMaye said that Obamacare is "devastating business, the economy, tax revenues, but more importantly lives. People who can’t see their doctors, can’t afford the insurance. I mean, I can go down the list -- I don’t need to tell you this. This is it? We have to wait until, what, 2017 in the hopes that we have a Republican in the White House? Can we survive that long?" Tillis responded, "I don’t think so. I think that we can make progress beginning in 2015 with a majority-Republican Senate. Maintain the majorities in the House. We can send legislation to the president that he may veto, but I think that we will make some progress. I think there may be some things that he’d rather not do, but they’ve got to understand the political consequences of continuing to fight for a failed policy." A little later on, he added, "A majority of the legislatures are Republican controlled -- a part of what we need to do is to mobilize the states to put on a more unified front against the federal government and get our legislatures more coordinated so that we keep the consequences of Obamacare in the minds of everyone, and build public support for pressuring members of Congress to vote with us and vote with the Republican majority." Tillis concluded, "I think there’s a lot of things we can do if we focus on a systematic approach to eliminating the bad -- and the majority of the stuff that is in Obamacare is bad, because it’s not fiscally sustainable. It’s a great idea that can’t be paid for -- let’s focus on the net problem versus a policy that’s creating as many problems as it fixes in terms of health care, and then it’s also creating the most devastating problem of a deficit and debt that we can’t afford." So what Tillis actually did in the interview was to call Obamacare "a great idea that can’t be paid for." And most of his comments before that discussed ways to repeal the bill, not support for it. This is far from the ringing endorsement that Hagan’s ad portrays. So how does the Hagan campaign defend its editing of Tillis’ comment? It says the point of the ad is to show that Tillis is playing both sides of the street on Obamacare. "Our ad says he’s trying to have it both ways, which he is," said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Hagan campaign. "He’s trying to take credit for supporting the popular parts of the law, but he has no plan to do that, and the only thing he does support is full repeal, which would mean insurance companies could deny care because of an existing condition and charge women more than men." We found some justification for this argument when we checked a claim by a pro-Democratic group that Tillis would let insurance companies "deny coverage for pre-existing conditions." We found that claim Mostly True, because Tillis hasn’t given concrete promises to keep any Obamacare provisions, such as that one, if and when a repeal takes place. Still, the use of misleading evidence in this case weakens the Hagan campaign’s argument. Our ruling Hagan’s ad says Tillis "called Obamacare ‘a great idea.' " That’s a severely edited quote. What Tillis actually said was that Obamacare is "a great idea that can’t be paid for." Pulling out that tiny sound bite gives a highly misleading view of what Tillis said in the interview. In reality, both sides in this contest are trying to have it both ways. Tillis wants to trumpet his opposition to Obamacare for a Republican primary audience that detests the law, yet downplay the reality that the across-the-board repeal he calls for would eliminate some broadly popular provisions. Hagan, for her part, is trying to argue that Tillis privately supports the very Obamacare he fiercely opposes in public. But to make that argument, she’s relying on extraordinarily thin evidence. We rate Hagan’s claim Mostly False.	None	Kay Hagan	None	None	None	2014-04-22T16:05:05	2014-04-17	['None']
pomt-02881	"The majority of people travelling to these destination resorts are not going for the primary purpose of gambling."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/nov/12/frank-fahrenkopf/gaming-advocate-says-most-people-go-high-end-casin/	Celine Dion concerts. Michelin-star restaurants. Luxurious spas. Could such amenities, instead of gambling, now be the biggest draw in high-end casinos? That’s the claim Frank J. Fahrenkopf, the recently retired CEO of the American Gaming Association, made in an opinion piece on South Florida resort casinos and regulations that he wrote for the Miami Herald. "The majority of people travelling to these destination resorts are not going for the primary purpose of gambling," he wrote. "They are visiting to dine at five-star restaurants, watch incredible live shows or participate in business meetings or conventions. Every year, thousands of people flock to these resorts to watch golf tournaments or tennis matches and never set foot in a casino." Fahrenkopf wrote that these types of resorts flourish in Las Vegas, Singapore, and Macau, adding, "There’s no doubt they will succeed in South Florida, too." His vision of an amenities-packed resort refers to the type of luxury casino model initially suggested by The Genting Group when it purchased the Miami Herald’s former bayfront property for $236 million, or the kind of large-scale destination the Las Vegas Sands Corp. is pursuing in Florida. The state Legislature is in the midst of high-stakes hearings taking place around Florida as lawmakers consider regulations and possible expansion of gambling, with meetings scheduled Nov. 14 and 15 in Pensacola and Jacksonville. The state already allows the Florida Lottery, the pari-mutuel industry (offering slot machines and card rooms) and Indian casinos. We wondered about Fahrenkopf’s factual claim that a majority of people traveling to destination resorts are not going primarily to gamble. Different resorts, different results Fahrenkopf said his evidence was an annual study done by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which reported in 2012 that 47 percent of all visitors said their primary reason for visiting Las Vegas was vacation or pleasure. Eight percent said they came primarily to gamble. When we reviewed the methodology of the study, we noticed that the survey asked an open-ended question: "What was the primary purpose of THIS trip to Las Vegas?" People could then give any answer they wished, and 47 percent answered "vacation/pleasure." Only 8 percent volunteered the answer "to gamble." We wondered if some people who answered "vacation/pleasure" chose the city as their vacation spot because it had gambling. But because of the survey's structure, though, we can't know if that's the case or not. Also, the question only applies to the city of Las Vegas. It might not apply to other cities that have casinos. David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told PolitiFact Florida that Fahrenkopf’s numbers "seem accurate" for Las Vegas, but he noted other markets face tougher odds. Consider Atlantic City. The $2.4 billion Revel casino in Atlantic City, for example, is a casino resort that focused on amenities and entertainment instead of slots or blackjack, and it faces financial failure. Revel opened in April 2012 and lasted less than a year before filing for bankruptcy. Company officials have changed the name to Revel Casino-Hotel, and said they are paying more attention to the gambling side of the business now. Not that being casino-centric has helped other Atlantic City casinos -- half of Atlantic City’s 12 casinos have filed for bankruptcy protection in the past six years, according to the Associated Press. The Atlantic Club, which filed Nov. 7, is the latest. John Sowinski, president of nocasinos.org, said that while amenities might draw nongamblers, Vegas is famous primarily as a gambling destination. "If people are going to these resorts for the amenities and not the gambling, then why do we need casinos?" Sowinski said. "Why climb Mount Everest politically to make this happen? … Other places can’t afford to have Celine Dion or Elton John perform." Indeed, even the American Gaming Association’s 2013 State of the State report shows that most people -- 53 percent -- who frequent casinos across the country always, or almost always, gamble. We should note the report also showed that people who go to resorts definitely take advantage of amenities. It found that 69 percent of all casinogoers ate at a fine dining restaurant while at a casino and 62 percent saw a show. But Fahrenkopf’s assertion side steps a central issue with Florida’s current gambling industry: Residents, not tourists, account for 93 percent of the $2.4 billion in estimated revenue collected by existing casinos, according to a recent report commissioned by the state Legislature. Spectrum Gaming Group of Atlantic City assessed the economic impact of existing and expanded gambling on local communities before lawmakers draft legislation to revise gaming regulations. The Spectrum report also found that 38.2 percent of adults in Florida live within an hour of a casino and gamble there at least once a year. In contrast, "Las Vegas does not rely on its residents" for the city’s gambling industry, said Joseph Weinert, senior vice president of the Spectrum Gaming Group, noting that top-notch attractions set Las Vegas apart from other casinos across the country. "The 24 largest resorts in Vegas are getting two-thirds of their revenue from nongaming sources," he said. The Spectrum report notes that by the late 1980s, gaming revenue in Las Vegas was down as other areas in the country started to legalize gambling. The city has been revitalized by becoming more of a party destination, according to the Spectrum report. "Attracting 21- (to) 34-years-olds from all over the world, Las Vegas now ranks No. 1 in categories such as, top destination for bachelor and bachelorette celebrations." Our ruling Fahrenkopf said that "the majority of people" traveling to destination resorts are not going primarily to gamble. He said he based this on a study done by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which showed that most visitors said they came to Las Vegas for vacation or pleasure. But we see two problems with this evidence. First, the survey applied only to Las Vegas. To say that its findings apply to all resorts, regardless of location, seems like a stretch. Second, people may have chosen to visit Las Vegas for vacation or pleasure primarily because it had gambling. The survey didn't press people for more details on their answers, so we can't know for sure. Meanwhile, a 2013 report from the American Gaming Association showed that most people -- 53 percent -- who frequent casinos across the country always, or almost always, gamble. Also, Florida casinos tend to draw from the local population. Whether Florida could draw visitors in the same way Las Vegas does remains to be seen. Fahrenkopf has a point that people who travel to destination resorts may have other things in mind besides gambling. But the evidence shows gambling is still an important part of the equation.

pomt-12458	The GOP health bill "would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition."	mostly false	/california/statements/2017/may/09/judy-chu/rape-pre-existing-condition-under-gop-bill-calif-c/	Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu of Los Angeles County repeated a deceptive claim about the GOP health care bill last week after it narrowly passed the U.S. House. Chu said the legislation "would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition," in a press release on May 4, 2017. Chu and all other Democrats in the House opposed the bill, which has an uncertain future in the U.S. Senate. The national PolitiFact team fact-checked similar claims in the headlines of several blogs and rated them Mostly False. It called the statements "bombastic" and "misleading." The Washington Post Fact Checker also rejected this claim, giving it four pinnochios. PolitiFact noted that some blogs have changed their headlines or issued corrections. In a written statement on May 10, 2017, Chu said she stands by her claim: "While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the (American Health Care Act)," she said. Summary of PolitiFact’s findings PolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at the national PolitiFact’s analysis and summarized it’s findings this way: The GOP bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition. Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition. States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable. Here’s what’s wrong with the claim Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Republicans’ Affordable Care Act replacement — the American Health Care Act, which the House passed May 4 — weakens those protections. These blog posts get at a real problem with the Republican bill if it were to become law. Victims of sexual assault could, conceivably, find themselves in a situation where they can’t afford insurance because of medical issues that stem from their assault. But the headlines that say the GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says. They stoke fears that the bill singles out victims of sexual assault, limiting their access to health care specifically. But the Republican bill doesn’t pinpoint any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition; that’s something the insurance companies or individual states would decide. As it stands, anyone with a pre-existing condition could face problems. Problems prior to the Affordable Care Act The blogs discuss anecdotal stories of women who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, were sexually assaulted and then sought treatment stemming from that assault. Later, when these women tried to purchase health insurance, they were denied coverage. These women weren’t necessarily denied coverage because of the sexual assault; rather, it was because of residual treatment they sought afterward, such as taking HIV-preventative medication or seeing a therapist. None of the several health insurance experts we consulted were aware of insurance companies with policies that specify "sexual assault" or "rape" as a condition to consider when evaluating someone’s eligibility. But insurance resources did regularly list mental health issues or sexually-transmitted illnesses as pre-existing conditions. For example, if a person were pricked with a used needle or had consensual sex with someone they later discovered had HIV, that person might also take HIV preventatives. And because they took that medication, they, like some sexual assault victims, might have trouble buying health insurance on the open market. If a sexual assault victim chose not to seek medical treatment, he or she wouldn’t necessarily face the same challenge in getting insurance. "This is not something specific about sexual assault," said Urban Institute senior fellow Linda Blumberg. "But to the extent victims of sexual assault are needing to take this (HIV) medication, they’re very vulnerable in terms of getting insurance coverage in the future." What repealing the Affordable Care Act could mean The Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent authority on health policy, recently wrote policy papers about pre-existing conditions prior to the Affordable Care Actand how repealing the law would affect women. Neither of those two articles say sexual assault victims would face a particular challenge. The Republicans’ bill doesn’t change what is or is not a pre-existing condition. What it does is allow more consideration of pre-existing conditions than is permitted under the Affordable Care Act. "The bill just leaves it to the imagination at this point," Blumberg said, referring to what insurance companies might consider as a pre-existing condition. To be clear, the bill doesn’t allow insurance providers to deny coverage to someone based on pre-existing conditions outright. But with a waiver, states can allow providers to set premium costs based on an individual’s "health status." Even though the bill puts in some protections, health economists say this could make insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions. Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies were not transparent about what counts as a pre-existing condition, and the House Republican replacement doesn’t change that, said Kathryn Votava, president of health care consulting company Goodcare. This allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the Republican bill becomes law, she said. "Could" is the key word. What ultimately happens depends on whether the bill is changed in the Senate and how states and insurance companies respond. The lack of transparency, as well as the potential for different policies from state to state, would put a significant burden on consumers trying to figure out whether they can obtain insurance given their health status, said Claire Brindis, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco. For victims of sexual assault in particular, the bill could have a chilling effect, she added. Women might choose not to seek medical treatment after an assault because they are concerned it might affect their ability to get health insurance down the line. Sexual assault "is the tip of the iceberg," Brindis said. "There are many many other examples of unexpected events that occur in day to day life, that you can’t plan for, can’t avoid." Our ruling Various bloggers, and some members of Congress, wrote that under the House Republican health plan, sexual assault and domestic violence is a pre-existing condition. Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from "would" to "could." The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health. The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don’t know for sure given the bill’s current form. PolitiFact National rated this claim Mostly False. Following the same analysis, PolitiFact California rates Chu’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. UPDATE: This fact check has been updated with a response from Rep. Chu, who issued a statement on May 10, 2017, which reads in full: "As it stands today, anybody with a preexisting condition is protected thanks to the Affordable Care Act. This includes women, who were previously charged more for a range of care that is, today, considered ‘essential’. The AHCA makes it easier for insurers to earn waivers to charge more for preexisting conditions and leaves the question of what should be covered up to others. In my statement, I said that this bill ‘would once again allow a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.’ While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the AHCA. We should not even be discussing how women can be charged more for their care, even if it requires 2, 3, or 4 extra steps. This bill represents a step backwards for Americans’ health in a number of ways." Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-01236	Repeal of Obamacare would "take away health care for 10.3 million Americans" who have received coverage since Oct. 1, 2013.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/18/ed-schultz/schultz-103-million-people-would-lose-insurance-ob/	The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, is back in the news as the 2015 open enrollment season gets underway. So far, unlike last year, the roll-out has been smooth. This hasn’t made Republicans a whit more fond of the law. Many want to repeal and replace it. Just before sign-ups began, liberal pundit and MSNBC show host Ed Schultz challenged Republicans to make good on that line. Schultz said he’s yet to see a fully fleshed out GOP alternative. Several bills spell out key elements of a Republican approach, but their full scope and impact remain unclear. Schultz zeroed in on this lack of precision. "The Republican agenda seems to want to reverse everything on health care," Schultz said on Nov. 13, 2014. "This is what (Sen. Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell wants to repeal. 10 million people. 10.3 uninsured Americans have received coverage since Oct. 1, 2013. That's a hard number that can be verified." Schultz picked Oct. 1, 2013, because that was the day the federal health insurance exchange opened (as best it could) for business. Would, as Schultz said, repeal of the Affordable Care Act take away the health coverage gained by 10.3 million people? The baseline numbers suggest Schultz is correct. Between October 2013 and June 2014, Gallup found that 10.3 million nonelderly adults gained health insurance coverage. It’s possible that this number has grown since the data cut off in June 2014. The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that, through June, 10.3 million adults gained health insurance coverage. Also through June, the Commonwealth Fund estimated the number at 9.5 million. And over the same period, the Urban Institute offered an estimate of 8 million. An earlier study -- through March -- by the RAND Corp. estimated a net gain of 9.3 million American adults with health insurance. These are net figures, meaning they include people who may have lost insurance. While there is some fluctuation, they largely support Schultz’s claim. The more difficult question to answer is, does the Affordable Care Act deserve all the credit? There are generally three ways people were added to the rolls of the insured since October 2013 -- through an employer, through Medicaid or through federal or state marketplaces. There are scenarios in each category whereby people gaining insurance could see their health care taken away if Obamacare is repealed, and there are scenarios where their health care would remain. Insurance through an employer The RAND survey — which will soon be updated — estimated that millions of newly insured Americans got coverage through an employer (Employer-sponsored insurance or ESI). Why? Partly because of the Affordable Care Act, and partly because the economy is improving and more people are finding work. "Enrollment in ESI increased by 8.2 million," the RAND analysts wrote, "Most of this increase was driven by people who were previously uninsured. Some of these newly insured individuals may have taken up an employer plan as a result of the incentive created by the individual mandate; others may have newly found a job." Since employer coverage provides most of the insurance in America, and unemployment dropped during this period, at least a portion of the newly insured would have gained coverage without Obamacare. However, the lead author of the New England Journal of Medicine article, Benjamin Sommers at the Harvard School of Public Health, said his analysis aimed to factor out the employment impact. "As best as we could do, without a true ‘control group,’ we were trying to estimate the changes in the uninsured rate attributable to the Affordable Care Act’s first open enrollment period," Sommers said. Sommers said even allowing for job growth, at least 10.3 million people gained coverage due solely to Obamacare. Insurance through Medicaid The RAND study also teased out that 3.6 million people relied on Medicaid to get out of the ranks of the uninsured. A major goal of the Affordable Care Act was to expand Medicaid by raising the income eligibility cut-off line to 138 percent of federal poverty. According to an analysis from the Urban Institute, virtually all of the higher Medicaid enrollment took place in the 24 states plus the District of Columbia that chose to expand Medicaid. Still, some portion of new Medicaid enrollees would have qualified under the previous terms. How big a portion is unclear, although Medicaid rolls increased by 5 percent even in states that did not raise the income limits. Insurance through marketplaces Lastly, the law created federal and state insurance marketplaces where people could pick and choose among private insurance plans. The RAND survey estimated that 1.4 million uninsured people wound up buying insurance this way. The total number is about 4 million, but that includes people who had insurance before. RAND economist Christine Eibner said the premium subsidies available through the marketplaces have helped millions of people. "If the ACA were repealed many would lose access to subsidies or Medicaid coverage, and could no longer afford insurance," Eibner said. However, it’s not entirely clear if all of the 1.4 million uninsured people who purchased insurance wanted it in the first place. Some might have purchased insurance simply because it was required as part of the health care law. In that sense, it’s hard to say their insurance would be taken away if the health care law were repealed. Other cases of people getting covered The full impact of Obamacare goes beyond the marketplaces and Medicaid expansion, so the total number could be higher still. In 2012, the law gave parents the option to keep their kids on their health insurance policies until they turned 26. About 2.5 million to 3 million people had taken advantage of the change. However, some of those would have had coverage even without the new policy. Both Eibner and Sommers, who is a part-time advisor to the Health and Human Services Department, said all told, they believe at least 10.3 million people owe their coverage to Obamacare. It's hard to get a definitive number, but the estimates we find put Schultz in the ballpark. Our ruling Schultz said repealing the Affordable Care Act would take away insurance coverage of about 10.3 million people. Based on multiple independent sources, the combination of the individual mandate, insurance subsidies through the insurance marketplaces, Medicaid expansion and raising the eligibility age for dependents delivers a total that is in the neighborhood of what Schultz said. But there is a bit of uncertainty in all of the numbers, and Schultz’s suggestion that health care would be "taken away" for everyone is a tad strong. With those caveats, we rate his claim Mostly True. Correction: A previous version of this story described Sen. Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader. The GOP election wins put him on track to assume the title, but he hadn't yet. He is described as Minority Leader.	None	Ed Schultz	None	None	None	2014-11-18T13:57:57	2014-11-13	['United_States']
pomt-13675	Says Barack Obama "said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males" and "that is a lie" because "there is no data."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/03/david-clarke-jr/sheriff-david-clarke-says-its-lie-black-males-twic/	On July 17, 2016, the day six officers were shot in Baton Rouge, La., Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. engaged in a testy interview about police shootings and race relations. About 2 minutes in, as the Fox News insider sat side-by-side with CNN anchor Don Lemon at the site of the Republican National Convention, Lemon abruptly went to a commercial as he and Clarke talked over each other. Clarke, a conservative who runs as a Democrat, was in Cleveland as a prime-time speaker at the GOP’s convention the following day. In the interview, Clarke made a claim about President Barack Obama and the police shooting of civilians during this exchange: Clarke: There is no data -- and you know this -- there is no data, there is no research that proves any of that nonsense. None. Even -- Lemon: You’d have to be more specific about what data and what nonsense you’re talking about. Clarke: That law enforcement officers treat black males different than white males in policing in these urban areas. Lemon: There is data that supports that. Clarke: There is not data. Lemon: The president spoke about it. Cedric Alexander, who’s a law enforcement officer -- Clarke: The president has been lying about it. He said it again the other day, when he said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males. Don, that is a lie. Lemon: That is not a lie. So, Clarke makes a two-part claim: 1. That Obama said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males. Is that what Obama said? 2. That the figure Obama cited is "a lie" because "there is no data" to back it up. In other words, are black males twice as likely as white males to be shot by police? In paraphrasing the president and calling a statistic a lie, even while saying there is no relevant data, Clarke makes a claim that’s on an important topic but in a somewhat muddled way. Let’s try to sort it out. What Obama said Clarke didn’t provide us any evidence that Obama said what he said he did. But the White House provided us, and PolitiFact National has annotated, what the president said July 7, 2016 in Warsaw, Poland. Obama spoke days after the fatal police shootings of two African-American men -- Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile, in Falcon Heights, Minn. One statistic the president recited was: "Last year, African-Americans were shot by police at more than twice the rate of whites." So, Clarke was slightly off in his paraphrasing. Obama’s reference was to all African-Americans, not just African-American males. The statistic Now to the second part of Clarke’s claim -- whether it’s "a lie" because "there is no data" that black males are two times more likely than white males to be shot by a law enforcement officer. This is where Clarke goes more astray. The sheriff told us through a spokeswoman to "read Heather Mac Donald's book, War on Cops. It's chock full of data that supports my position." Mac Donald, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research in New York, told us she didn’t have any statistics on whether black males are more likely to be shot by police. Mac Donald did emphasize that how often black males are shot by police should be considered not in terms of what percentage black males are of the total population, but their rates of violent crime, since being involved in violent crime increases the likelihood of being shot by police. That view has been advanced by some criminologists. And the Washington Post, in its reporting on fatal shootings by police, has noted that a disproportionate number of murders and other violent crimes are committed by black Americans. The Post, which won a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for its work on fatal shootings by police, reported in July 2016 that, taking into account population, black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers. (And The Guardian, which tracks people killed by police by shootings or any means, reported that in 2015, black people were killed by police at twice the rate of white, Hispanic and native Americans. ) But, again, those figures are for fatal police shootings. When it comes to the likelihood, by race and gender, of being shot by police, University Louisville criminology and criminal justice professor Justin Nix told us: "We just don’t have the data to make a statement like that." Nix and four other criminology and criminal justice professors told us there simply are no national figures on all police shootings. Said Samuel Walker at the University of Nebraska at Omaha: "I’m cautiously optimistic," given the attention being paid to police shootings, "that the FBI will begin collecting the data." Our rating Clarke made essentially a two-part claim. He said that Obama "said black males are two times more likely to be shot by a law enforcement officer than white males," but he was slightly off, in that the president spoke about all African-Americans and whites, not just males. Clarke also said the two times more likely statistic is "a lie" because "there is no data." He is correct that there is no national data on all police shootings -- fatal and non-fatal -- to back that statistic. But he goes too far in saying it is a lie, given that we don’t know if the statistic is accurate. For a statement that contains some element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.	None	David A.

pomt-10218	John McCain's tax plan will give no reduction "for 100-million American families."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/08/joe-biden/100-million-people-is-more-accurate/	Joe Biden accepted his party's nomination to be vice president at the Democratic National Convention in Denver and used his acceptance speech to attack Republican John McCain's economic policies. "John thinks that during the Bush years we've made great progress economically. I think it's been abysmal," Biden said in his speech on Aug. 27, 2008. McCain proposes tax breaks for "the largest companies in the nation, but no — none — no relief for 100-million American families. That's not change; that's more of the same," Biden said. Here, we're checking Biden's claim that McCain's plan provides "no relief for 100-million American families." We checked with the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that has extensively analyzed the tax proposals of both presidential candidates. Both McCain and Obama propose extending the Bush tax cuts to some extent. McCain wants the tax cuts extended for all income levels, while Obama wants the tax cuts extended for only those making less than about $250,000. Besides those extensions, McCain also proposes increasing the exemption for dependents like children. Obama, on the other hand, offers a tax credit of about $500 per person for people who work. Because more people work than claim dependents, Obama's plan tends to impact more people. The question here is how many people get no reduction in taxes under McCain's proposals. Using the current tax policies as a baseline, McCain's proposals would mean about 44 percent of tax units would not get a tax reduction in 2009, and about 46 percent would get no tax reduction in 2012, according to the center's analysis. A "tax unit" is a technical term for a typical tax return. A single person is one tax unit, and a married couple filing jointly counts as one unit. There are about 150-million tax units filing annually. So between 66-million and 69-million tax units will receive no tax reduction under the McCain plan, according to the center. But Biden said 100-million American families . We're guessing that Biden may have inflated a claim made in an earlier Obama ad that said "100-million Americans will get no tax relief at all." Biden would have made a better case if he had said 100-million people get no tax reduction, because a tax unit can represent more than one person. But in many cases, one family will equal one tax unit. The analysis we use shows between 66-million and 69-million tax units will not see a reduction under the McCain plan. Because the numbers fall short of Biden's statement of 100-million families, we rule it only Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-09-08T00:00:00	2008-08-27	['United_States', 'John_McCain']

pomt-04836	Says U.S. Rep. Martin Heinrich "spent a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/14/american-future-fund/did-new-mexico-rep-spend-1-trillion-tax-dollars-st/	The American Future Fund, a group that advocates "conservative and free-market" principles, is targeting U.S. Rep. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the Democratic nominee for a Senate seat being vacated later this year by Jeff Bingaman. In the ad, titled "Frustrating," a narrator says, "The past few years have been frustrating and disappointing. Washington says the economy is better, but we sure don't see it. We're tightening our belts, but Washington is spending more and delivering less. Martin Heinrich told New Mexico he would fight unemployment, but he spent a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas. So thousands of New Mexicans remain jobless, and unemployment got worse. Tell Martin Heinrich to stop the wasteful spending that's hurting our economy." It’s correct that Heinrich voted for the stimulus bill known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. But did that bill spend "a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas"? (We tried to reach the American Future Fund but the group did not return our inquiries.) First, we should note that while the bill was huge, its pricetag was not as big as the $1 trillion cited in the ad. The measure was passed with an estimated cost of $787 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office later revised that upward to $814 billion. Still, generous rounding isn’t the biggest problem with the ad’s claim. The most significant problem is that the claim suggests that the stimulus bill spent that much money on "failed companies here and jobs overseas." Even allowing for some hyperbole, as we do the ad’s charge is way off base because it distorts how the stimulus was spent. By our count, the overwhelming majority of the stimulus couldn't have possibly been spent on "failed companies here and jobs overseas." Here are just a few of the bigger examples of spending categories in the bill that don’t have anything to do with failed companies or jobs overseas. (It comes from a breakdown of stimulus-bill spending by recovery.gov, the federal government’s stimulus website, which uses a higher measurement of the bill’s cost -- $840 billion.) • Individual tax credits for homebuyers, commuting, education and the Earned Income Tax Credit: $135.9 billion • Making Work Pay tax credit for working individuals and families: $104.6 billion • Medicaid and Medicare spending: $92.5 billion • One-time payments to Social Security recipients: $13.8 billion • Aid for public and Indian housing and homelessness prevention: $13.3 billion • Science, research and development, including National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health: $13.2 billion So what aspects of the bill might conceivably have led to aid for "failed companies" and supported "jobs overseas"? • Transportation spending, $35.3 billion • Tax incentives for business, $33.5 billion • Infrastructure spending, $28.6 billion • Energy and environment spending, $26.3 billion • Energy entitlements, $14.2 billion • Energy tax incentives, $10.8 billion • Manufacturing and economic recovery, infrastructure refinancing tax free bonds, $9.2 billion If you add up all of these categories, the maximum you’d get is $158 billion. And that assumes that every penny spent by these portions of the bill -- which collectively account for 19 percent of the bill’s total cost -- would have been frittered away on failed companies and overseas jobs. "The stimulus was basically one-third increased spending for existing programs, which could go to failed companies and jobs overseas, one-third for tax provisions that really can’t be guided that much and many of which were not going to companies at all, and one-third in payments to the states, which clearly was not going to failed companies here and jobs overseas," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Republicans are correct that some recipients of stimulus money failed, such as Solyndra, a solar manufacturer that received a $535 million federal loan guarantee in 2009 from the stimulus. The company got special attention from the Obama administration, which relished the idea of supporting manufacturing jobs and homegrown green energy. But the company collapsed spectacularly less than two years later, followed by an FBI raid and Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Taxpayers were on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Still, we've found Republicans' claims about Solyndra have often been exaggerated and given them mediocre ratings. And while $500 million is hardly chump change, it’s an exaggeration to say that any large percentage of the stimulus was spent on such failures. For instance, we have noted serious problems with the claim in one ad that "President Obama wasted $34 billion on risky investments." While the Energy Department has committed $34.7 billion in low-interest loans to nearly 40 green projects, only Solyndra and one other company has filed for bankruptcy. Our friends at FactCheck.org calculated that the government could lose as much as $578 million on those two deals -- less than 2 percent of the total program, which itself is a small part of the stimulus as a whole. Ads that claim the stimulus supported job creation overseas haven’t fared very well in our ratings, either. Our ruling A charitable interpretation of the ad would be that it was sloppily worded. That may be, but we think a viewer unfamiliar with the stimulus would come away with the idea that $1 trillion in tax dollars were spent on "failed companies" and "jobs overseas." People are free to disagree with the wisdom of passing a stimulus and criticize the way Washington spent the money, but it’s flat wrong to suggest that any large percentage of stimulus spending ended up going to failed companies and jobs overseas. About four-fifths of the total spent was allocated to items that literally couldn’t go for those purposes. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08647	Says a "Pro-Stimulus economist admits it is not working … "	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/16/rob-portman/rob-portman-cites-remarks-pro-stimulus-economist-p/	It's no secret that Rob Portman isn't a fan of the federal stimulus program Congress approved to jump start the economy. The Republican, who is running against Ohio Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher for the U.S. Senate, has labeled it as a program that failed to create jobs in Ohio. In a post Aug. 25 to his campaign Facebook page, which has more than 20,000 followers, Portman links to an article he says proves he's right. "Pro-Stimulus economist admits it is not working," he says in the post. We checked out the link on Portman's page and found a story from The Hill, a Washington newspaper which covers Congress. In the article, Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics, discusses the chances of a double-dip recession, which he rated as one in three. He previously had thought those chances to be just one in five. Zandi, speaking to reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor, cited weak consumer confidence, nervous businesses and investors, declining home sales and the European debt crisis as factors slowing U.S. economic recovery and prompting his prediction. If Congress and the White House compromise on the expiring Bush tax reductions, that would help boost confidence, he said. What isn't discussed at all is whether Zandi thinks the $787 billion stimulus package, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, is working. The word stimulus appears just once in the lead of the story: "An economist who advised Democrats on the $787 billion stimulus has increased his prediction of the odds of the economy entering a double-dip recession." Since the Christian Science Monitor hosted the breakfast at which Zandi spoke, we decided to check out its coverage of the event. The Monitor posted a handful of stories, with video, about the event. In one of them, Zandi is asked to respond to an assertion by House Minority Leader John Boehner about the stimulus program. Speaking at the City Club of Cleveland the day before, the Ohio Republican said that "all this stimulus spending has gotten us nowhere." Zandi, who was an advisor to John McCain's presidential campaign was clear in his disagreement. "We would be in a measurably worse place if not for the stimulus," he said. "I don't think it is any coincidence that the great recession ended at precisely the same time that the stimulus, and in this case when I say stimulus I am talking about the (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) ...was providing its maximum benefit." The national unemployment rate at the time was about 9.5 percent. Without the stimulus, Zandi said, it would have been 11.5 percent. Expectations for the stimulus may have been too high, he said. "But the stimulus did exactly what it was intended to do. It was to end the recession and jump start a recovery and it did that."

pomt-00993	The group that organized Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin "was recently listed as one of 82 organizations designated as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/feb/06/molly-white/molly-white-says-muslim-group-recently-designated-/	A Texas legislator who says she asks U.S. Muslims if they renounce terrorism prompted a viral firestorm online with a Facebook post. She followed that up with an explanation, saying the organization behind Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin had been labeled a terrorist group. In her Feb. 3, 2015, web post, "My Response to the Critics," state Rep. Molly White, R-Belton, said her Facebook statement posted Jan. 29, 2015 as Muslims came to the Capitol was misconstrued "into something intolerant, bigoted and anti-American." Here’s her original Facebook post, as later highlighted by the Texas Tribune: In her February follow-up, White wrote: "As a legislator who has the responsibility to look out for and protect the safety as well as liberties of my constituents and all Texans, it remains my duty to stay vigilant and inform the public about maintaining our rule of law and protecting our 1st Amendment freedoms." "First," she wrote, "the genesis of my statement occurred when the organization CAIR was brought to my attention. CAIR, Council on American-Islamic Relations, started Muslim Day at the Texas Capitol in 2003." Sarwat Husain, a council leader from San Antonio, told us by email the day at the Capitol was started by Texas Muslim groups including the council, which took charge of the gathering starting in 2011. "Second," White’s response said, "it is worth noting that CAIR was recently listed as one of 82 organizations designated as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates. That’s right, an Islamic country listed the organization that hosts Muslim Day in Texas as one of 82 terrorist organizations." For real? Legislator cites news story White’s response included a web link to a November 2014 Fox News story stating the UAE, a tiny oil-rich federation on the Arabian Peninsula, had just designated CAIR a terrorist group on a list including extremists such as the Islamic State and Al Nusra, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria. The story also quoted the council calling on the UAE to remove CAIR, the Muslim American Society and other "civil society organizations" from the list, saying its own inclusion was a "bizarre move." The council, headquartered on Capitol Hill, says it was founded in 1994 to challenge stereotypes of Islam and Muslims. Its Houston-based Texas chapter was founded in 2002. Advocating terrorism isn’t a declared activity. The council says on its website: "CAIR believes that Muslims worldwide must offer themselves as personal examples of the Islamic values of compassion, tolerance and moderation. We encourage members of the American Muslim community to work in public service." Also: "We have a well-established, very public record of denouncing terrorism and religious intolerance." Council listed as terrorist group In contrast, the UAE named the council a terrorist organization in November 2014. Online, we spotted a full government-issued list of more than 80 groups, including al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, al Shabab and Boko Haram--and CAIR. A Nov. 20, 2014, news story on GulfNews.com said the list designating terrorist organizations around the world had been issued by the government’s cabinet Nov. 15, 2014, in line with an anti-terror law issued in August 2014 by the nation’s president, Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Under the law, the story said, any individual or group that even communicates with a group on the list commits an offense. The story said the list would be reviewed by the government at least once a year. According to the story, Anwar Mohammad Gargash, a government minister, said most objections were from groups tied to the Muslim Brotherhood and "many of them have engaged in incitement and the creation of an atmosphere of extremism." CAIR was not singled out. As PolitiFact noted in 2013, the Brotherhood is an Islamic political and social movement founded in Egypt nearly 90 years ago that has millions of members throughout the Middle East. In Egypt and other countries, the Brotherhood has frequently been oppressed. After Hosni Mubarak was ousted from the Egyptian presidency in 2011, the group was legalized. But the year after Mohamed Morsi, the Brotherhood’s candidate for president, won election in 2012, he was overthrown in a military coup and arrested. In an interview with Fox News posted online Nov. 21, 2014, UAE’s foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, was asked why its list included the council and the U.S.-based Muslim American Society, which expressed shock at its inclusion. The minister replied: "Our threshold is quite low when we talk about extremism. We cannot accept incitement or funding when we look at some of these organizations. I mean, for many countries, the definition of terror is that you have to carry a weapon and terrorize people. For us, it’s far beyond that. We cannot tolerate even the smallest and the tiniest amount of terrorism." He did not offer specifics (nor was he asked to do so). On Nov. 17, 2014, foreign-affairs reporter Adam Taylor said in a Washington Post news blog post that a significant number of the "more surprising inclusions on the list appear to have ties to" the Muslim Brotherhood: "The Muslim American Society, for instance, was founded by Muslim Brotherhood members in the 1990s. Rumors about links to the Muslim Brotherhood have also dogged CAIR," Taylor wrote. We contacted the council. National spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said the council has no connection to the Muslim Brotherhood. Asked about the UAE minister’s statement, Hooper emailed: "We are one of the nation's most vocal advocates for constitutionally-protected civil liberties. That is hardly ‘incitement.’ And we do not ‘fund’ anyone." State Department doubts Hooper further pointed out C-SPAN video of a State Department spokesman, Jeff Rathke, saying Nov. 18, 2014: "The United States does not consider these U.S. organizations to be terrorist organizations," going on to specify the council and Muslim American Society by name. Rathke also said the government was asking the UAE for more information. (See the State Department transcript here.) The council doesn’t appear on the State Department’s list of designated terrorist organizations. Another council official, Corey Saylor, suggested by email that many groups did not belong on the UAE list. Other analyses A Nov. 25, 2014, news story in the Daily Mail, a British newspaper, quoted experts including Frederic Wehrey at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace saying that by listing groups like the council, Islamic Relief UK and some of the largest Muslim associations in Finland, Norway, Sweden and other European countries, "the UAE is pushing its view that the fight against militant Islamism is as much an ideological war as a conventional one. The real target of the list," Wehrey said, is "politically active Islamism." Wehry went on: "(The UAE) is trying to include non-violent, Brotherhood-affiliated groups in the same ideological constellation as real terrorist groups like (Nigeria's) Boko Haram and Al-Qaeda," he said. Andrew Hammond, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations' Middle East and North Africa program, said: "I think the criteria (for the list) has been to look at anything that could have even a remote link to the Muslim Brotherhood." More recently, according to a Jan. 17, 2015, news story on ArabianBusiness.com, the UAE has agreed to allow groups to appeal listing decisions to the government’s Ministry of Justice; the story said Jenifer Wicks, the council’s civil rights litigation director, had recently "submitted documents seeking to appeal the designation." Unindicted co-conspirators? Next, we asked Hooper and Saylor about CAIR in 2007 being named among 300 others as an unindicted co-conspirator in a U.S. case regarding funding to the extremist group Hamas, as Fox News said in the news story noted by White. Saylor said the council was identified that way along with other groups with interests in Muslim or Palestinian issues. In October 2010, Saylor said, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the government had violated the Fifth Amendment rights of another group named as an unindicted co-conspirator — and by implication the council and other groups, Saylor said. The court, saying the government inappropriately failed to file the list "under seal," also said inclusion on the list was the result of "simply an untested allegation of the government made in anticipation of a possible evidentiary dispute that never came to pass." In March 2011, the Washington Post noted a federal judge, Jorge A. Solis, denied the council’s request to be stricken from the list of unindicted co-conspirators. Regardless, the story said, the council had never been charged with criminal activity. Reporter Glenn Kessler summed up: "The repeated references to CAIR being an ‘unindicted co-conspirator’ is one of those true facts that ultimately gives a false impression." Footnote: White’s February response also noted a Texas Tribune news story revealing her concern that one of CAIR’s Texas leaders, Mustafa Carroll, said at a Capitol rally in 2013 that practicing Muslims "are above the law of the land." White’s quotation of Carroll was incomplete, the Tribune said, in that Carroll had prefaced his comment by saying: "Following the law of the land is part of Sharia. And we follow the law of the land." Carroll told the Tribune that by saying Muslims were "above the law," he meant practicing Muslims should "behave in a way that would put them above any possibility of breaking the law." Our ruling White said the council, which organized Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin, "was recently listed as one of 82 organizations designated as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates." So it was. However, her statement failed to note the U.S. government shortly disagreed with the council’s inclusion on the list, saying it doesn’t consider the council a terrorist group. For our part, too, we found no independent indicator the council merits identification as a terrorist organization. On balance, we rate this singling out of a seemingly flawed designation Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-13910	Barack Obama issued a decree "demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into the little girls’ bathroom."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/jun/26/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-makes-mostly-false-claim-about-obama-dire/	Nothing gives the president "power to be the bathroom police," U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz declared at the Republican Party of Texas convention as he took fierce issue with an Obama administration letter to public schools distributed the day before. In the May 13, 2016, letter, federal agencies cited a decades-old federal law barring discrimination in educational settings as the basis for telling school superintendents nationally to let transgender students use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Cruz, fresh off his bid for president, told delegates: "The president issued a decree to every public school in America demanding that they change their bathroom policies, demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into little girls’ bathrooms. We have entered the world of politically correct lunacy." Did Cruz accurately sum up the Obama directive? To our emailed request for the basis of Cruz’s statement, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack said only: "By the very text of the directive you linked, anyone in a public school, whether they are students or adults (which includes adult 18-year old students), would be able to enter any restroom." Novack also accurately noted the guidance also applies to colleges that accept federal aid. Obama administration letter We asked a Department of Education spokeswoman, Dorie Nolt, if the directive, particularly the portion on access to restrooms and locker rooms, would also apply to adults in schools. By email, Nolt replied: "Our guidance is related to students." For our part, we noticed that the letter in question doesn’t tell schools to let men into girls’ restrooms; it doesn’t say anything about adults in public schools. And its language about students is focused on transgender boys and girls whose gender identity doesn’t match their sex assignment at birth. The eight-page letter from the U.S. departments of Justice and Education tells school districts to be compliant with Title IX protections against sex discrimination by allowing students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms of the gender they identify with. The letter, also affecting says the agencies are offering "significant guidance" on policies related to transgender students in relation to athletics, housing and overnight accommodations and education records, among areas. In regard to restrooms and locker rooms, the letter states: "A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity. A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so. A school may, however, make individual-user options available to all students who voluntarily seek additional privacy." Defining transgender And what qualifies as "transgender"? Here’s how the Obama administration letter defines it: "Transgender describes those individuals whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. A transgender male is someone who identifies as male but was assigned the sex of female at birth; a transgender female is someone who identifies as female but was assigned the sex of male at birth." The letter defines gender identity as "an individual’s internal sense of gender. A person’s gender identity may be different from or the same as the person’s sex assigned at birth." The National Center for Transgender Equality, a social justice advocacy organization for transgender people, says a transgender individual is a person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth. Otherwise, the American Psychological Association defines transgender as "an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth." Then again, there are professionals who dispute such definitions. For instance, Paul McHugh, a psychiatrist formerly at Johns Hopkins University, said in a June 12, 2014, Wall Street Journal commentary: "At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered. ‘Sex change’ is biologically impossible," McHugh said. "People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder." Bathroom debate Debate over whether a transgender person should use the bathroom aligning with his or her gender identity or gender assigned at birth picked up steam after North Carolina lawmakers in March 2016 passed a measure into law requiring people to use the bathroom corresponding with the gender on their birth certificate in public multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities. In Texas in April 2016, the superintendent of the Fort Worth Independent School District, Kent Scribner, approved bathroom policy guidelines Scribner described as a call to meet the needs of the district’s transgender students. Then on May 9, 2016, Lt. Gov Dan Patrick called for the superintendent to resign. Less than a week later, the Education and Justice departments sent their letter, which was met with a lawsuit, filed May 25, 2016, against the administration by Texas and 10 other states. Our ruling Cruz said Obama issued a decree "demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into the little girls’ bathroom." Federal agencies told schools to let transgender students use the restrooms corresponding to their gender identity. Yet that letter of guidance says nothing about grown men or other adults, leaving this claim with just an element of truth provided you believe, as Cruz apparently does, that a transgender person born a boy remains a boy. We rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-04804	On supporting the charter school amendment.	half flip	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/21/john-barge/ga-superintendents-statement-draws-flip-flop-charg/	Many charter school supporters, including the governor, felt they were double-crossed last week when Georgia School Superintendent John Barge announced his opposition to a constitutional amendment aimed at creating more charter schools. The amendment would reinstate the Georgia Charter Schools Commission, a body that can approve charter schools that local boards reject. The state Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional. Gov. Nathan Deal released a statement that said Barge "no longer believes parents should have public school options for their children." "His new position doesn’t change mine," Deal said. "I stand with two-thirds of the General Assembly and will uphold the promises I made when I ran for office." Others claimed Barge had flip-flopped. "[T]his is a flip-flop for the record books," said Bert Brantley, who was the communications director when Sonny Perdue was governor and is working with charter school supporters for the referendum. Barge’s spokesman said he has not switched his position at all. "It was the same then as it is now," Matt Cardoza said. Some political observers assumed Barge was completely committed to the amendment after he endorsed state Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers, one of the chief supporters of school choice, in the lawmaker’s tough re-election bid. PolitiFact Georgia did some homework to find out whether Barge changed his opinion. The commission was created by House Bill 881, which was passed by the state Legislature and signed into law by Perdue in 2008. The legislation covered a range of issues, from the commission’s power to how the schools it created would be funded. The Supreme Court struck down the commission in a 4-3 decision. Its 2011 opinion said that state lawmakers do not have the power to grant the state authority to approve and fund charter schools over the objection of local school boards. The proposed amendment would make the charter school commission constitutional. Barge’s opponents say proof of his flip-flop lies in his answers to a 2010 campaign questionnaire by the Georgia Charter Schools Association, an advocacy group. It asked whether Barge agreed with the statement "I support House Bill 881." His answer: "Strongly agree." But this doesn’t prove Barge flip-flopped, Cardoza said. The 130-word lead-up to the question asked for the candidate’s stance on funding for commission-approved charter schools, not the bill as a whole. It explained that under HB 881, if a student attends this kind of charter school, the per-pupil amount of local tax revenue that would have gone to the district for his or her education goes to the charter school instead. Barge’s response to a separate question showed he had reservations about the commission. It asked whether Barge supported "non-district authorizers," or entities such as the commission that have the power to approve and monitor charters without local school board interference. Barge’s answer: "Agree." But he found it "greatly disappointing that we need another administrative body to do something that the local, and ultimately, the state board of education should be able to do." Barge’s response gave the clear impression that he supported the commission’s creation, although he held reservations about the extra level of bureaucracy it created. "While the opponents of his position want you to focus on the HB 881 question, it’s hard to not see how he clearly felt based on his answer to the more important question regarding having a third authorizer to do what the local boards and state board can already do," Cardoza said. Cardoza stressed Barge is still a strong supporter of charter schools. Barge’s announcement Tuesday restated this concern. He said the commission "unnecessarily duplicates the good work already being done by local districts, the Georgia Department of Education, and the state Board of Education." Another point in Barge’s favor is that he filled out the questionnaire in 2010. It’s poor proof that he changed his stance on an issue that didn’t exist until 2011. We found no evidence that before Tuesday’s announcement Barge had taken a public stance for reinstating the commission. In fact, he gave the impression he’d avoid taking one. Atlanta Journal-Constitution political columnist Jim Galloway described Barge’s position in a July 25 story: "Asked whether he would campaign for the charter school question, state School Superintendent John Barge expressed a fondness for charter schools in an email, but added this: ‘We will, of course, respect the will of the citizens of Georgia regarding how charter schools are authorized.’" If Barge’s opinion changed on anything, it’s over whether to campaign on the issue, not the amendment itself. Barge broke ranks with other charter school supporters when he decided to oppose the amendment, but he did not quite flip-flop. Barge expressed support for creating the commission before it was declared unconstitutional. We found no evidence that Barge spoke for or against an amendment that would reinstate it until his announcement Tuesday. Barge did shift his approach. And he’s no longer holding his tongue. For this, he earns a Half Flip.	None	John Barge	None	None	None	2012-08-21T06:00:00	2012-08-15	['None']
pomt-04360	"The president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/22/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-wants-daylight-us-israel-relatio/	Mitt Romney frequently criticizes President Barack Obama’s stance on Israel, saying the president doesn’t hold the Jewish state in a tight enough embrace. "The president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel," Romney said in a foreign policy-focused debate, the final one of the presidential election. We decided to dig into the origin of that statement and check whether Romney’s characterization is accurate. What Obama (reportedly) said The "daylight" comment stems from a July 15, 2012, story in the Washington Post about a meeting Obama held in 2009 with several Jewish leaders. The meeting was closed to the press, and there is no transcript of what was said. The Post story was based on interviews with people in the meeting. Here’s the relevant excerpt: "If you want Israel to take risks, then its leaders must know that the United States is right next to them," Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, told the president. Obama politely but firmly disagreed. "Look at the past eight years," he said, referring to the George W. Bush administration's relationship with Israel. "During those eight years, there was no space between us and Israel, and what did we get from that? When there is no daylight, Israel just sits on the sidelines, and that erodes our credibility with the Arab states." The White House does not confirm that Obama said those words. There also has been no explicit denial. What he meant Further into the Post story, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes explained Obama’s purpose in the meeting, in which he explained to the Jewish leaders his thinking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how he differed from Bush’s approach. "The case he was trying to make was that the United States will be a better partner to Israel if it has more credibility with the Arab states, that we will be a better, more useful friend to Israel if we have more friends in the Arab world," Rhodes said, according to the story. The White House pointed us to several examples of how Obama is not distancing his administration from Israel. He and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have met nine times and spoken on the phone dozens of times. In July, Obama signed the Israel Security Act, a bill designed to increase security ties with the Jewish state, and boosted U.S. funding for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system by $70 million. The White House also pointed to statements from Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on the two countries’ relationship. Netanyahu, at the AIPAC conference in May 2011: "Yesterday President Obama spoke about his ironclad commitment to Israel's security. He rightly said that our security cooperation is unprecedented. He spoke of that commitment not just in front of AIPAC. He spoke about it in two speeches heard throughout the Arab world. And he has backed those words with deeds." Barak, to CNN in July: "This administration under President Obama is doing in regard to our security more than anything that I can remember in the past." Some interpretations We talked to Danielle Pletka, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who said Romney’s take was a "fair paraphrase" of Obama’s reported words. "It is the widespread perception that the president has in fact worked fairly assiduously to put daylight between the U.S. and Israel," she said, mentioning Obama’s more hard-line stance on Israeli settlements and his comment to French President Nicolas Sarkozy about Netanyahu, saying, "You're tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day." "I think it’s a world view. I think that President Obama’s world view is not one in which Israel plays a special role -- Israel is a country like any other, it causes us too much trouble in the Middle East, and the time has come to distance ourselves," Pletka said, adding that most Americans don’t share that view. Aaron David Miller, in a first-person piece for Foreign Policy magazine, wrote that when it comes to Israel, "Obama really is different. Unlike (President Bill) Clinton and George W. Bush, Obama isn't in love with the idea of Israel. As a result, he has a harder time making allowances for Israeli behavior he doesn't like. Obama relates to the Jewish state not on a values continuum but through a national security and interest filter." Referring to the Post story, Miller wrote: "Obama doesn't believe the ‘no daylight’ argument -- that is, to get Israel to move, you need to make the Israelis feel that America will stand by it no matter what. Quite the opposite: Obama appears to believe that Israel needs to understand that if it doesn't move, the United States will be hard pressed to continue to give it complete support." On the other side of the argument, Natan Sachs, a scholar with the centrist Brookings Institution, said it’s somewhat misleading for Romney to say that daylight is Obama’s goal. "It is true that President Obama, early in his tenure, tried to carve out a role for the United States as a broker for negotiations, airing differences in policy between the United States and Israel, especially on settlements. It is also true that this coincided with his attempt to regain U.S credibility in the Arab and Muslim world... But two important caveats should be made: once the attempt to restart negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians failed, the Obama administration has in fact stopped putting much pressure on the Israeli government on settlements. ... Second, the point of the policy was not to put ‘daylight’ per se, but rather to be forward about policy disagreements between Israel and the United States -- disagreements that the Bush administration shared, to some degree -- rather than attempting to hide this disagreements," Sachs wrote in an email. Our ruling Romney said that Obama said he would create daylight between the United States and Israel. It’s not as simple in this case as going to the tape to see what Obama said. The comment was reported secondhand by the Washington Post, based on anonymous interviews. Romney fairly characterizes a quote attributed to Obama, which the White House has not denied. We rate Romney's statement Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-22T23:15:28	2012-10-22	['Israel']
pomt-03303	Ninety million Americans either aren’t working or aren’t looking for work.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/30/blog-posting/are-90-million-americans-not-working-or-looking-wo/	A reader recently asked us to check a claim that’s been widely repeated on conservative websites -- that 90 million Americans either aren’t working or aren’t looking for work. Over the past few months, the statistic has been cited by various conservative bloggers, pundits and news outlets. We thought we’d take a closer look. Here’s how the calculation is made, using Census Bureau population estimates and employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics: The total U.S. population age 16 and over is at least 243 million. Subtracting the nearly 156 million Americans in the labor force in June 2013 -- that is, those who were either working or looking for work -- leaves 87 million Americans, which is close to 90 million. However, the 90 million number is padded, since this number includes a lot of Americans who wouldn’t be expected to be working. Specifically: • People age 16 to 17, who likely are in high school: 9 million • People who are enrolled in either two- or four-year colleges: 21 million • People age 65 and older, who have reached retirement age: 40 million people That means 20 million people are of normal working age, not in college and not working. That’s less than one-quarter the amount repeatedly cited in the blogosphere. So the 90 million number is exaggerated. Even so, the idea that fewer people are joining the workforce is something that worries economists. All things being equal, economists like to see more people working because it helps economic growth (though not at the expense of dropping out of school, which can limit future employment opportunities and earnings potential). To gauge these trends, economists can calculate the labor force participation rate, which is the percentage of the population that is either working or looking for work, and they can calculate the employment to population ratio, which is the percentage of the 16-and-over population that is currently employed. Both statistics generally track each other, but not in lockstep. Here’s a summary of these statistics between the end of the last recession in June 2009 and the most recent month available, June 2013. Statistic June 2009 June 2013 Change Employment level 142.2 million 144.1 million +1.9 million Civilian labor force 154.2 million 155.8 million +1.6 million Labor force participation rate 65.7 percent 63.5 percent -2.2 percentage points Employment to population ratio 60.6 percent 58.7 percent -1.9 percentage points So the number of people employed and the number joining the labor force have both increased since the end of the last recession -- but, importantly, these gains haven’t kept pace with the rise in population. This decline actually started around 2000, but it intensified starting with the most recent recession. "The trick is to determine how much of the drop represents the impact of a lagging economy, which is worrisome, and how much is due to non-worrisome factors, such as the aging of the adult population," Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, told PolitiFact earlier this year. As more adults begin moving into retirement age, the percentage of Americans who work is bound to decline. And that’s been happening in a big way as the baby boomers age. Burtless has determined that the two employment ratios would have fallen in recent years just on the basis of aging, even if there had been no recession. But the age-related decline has been worsened by high unemployment rates during the recession. Most troubling, economists say, is the decline among the core working ages of 25 to 55. In addition, the tight job market has convinced more people to opt out of the labor market, perhaps by becoming students or stay-at-home parents. The key to describing the employment situation is to make sure you’re using the best possible statistics. "It’s important not to downplay the seriousness of the decline, while still getting the numbers right," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Our ruling Bloggers and pundits have said that 90 million Americans either aren’t working or aren’t looking for work. That’s a real number, but it includes high schoolers, college students and retirement-age Americans, leaving perhaps 20 million a better approximation. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01373	"All four on Mount Rushmore, they were all independents at one critical point in their career."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/16/larry-pressler/larry-pressler-independent-senate-candidate-claims/	Early in the election cycle, South Dakota was viewed as safely Republican in the 2014 midterms. But the emergence of a familiar face has left the outcome up in the air just weeks before Election Day. Larry Pressler was a Republican in the Senate for 18 years before losing to Democrat Tim Johnson in 1996. Now, as Johnson retires, Pressler’s back running as an independent, undercutting what was supposed to be a cakewalk for Republican Mike Rounds and giving hope to Democrat Rick Weiland. At a recent candidate forum, Pressler made the case for his campaign. He said South Dakotans don’t have to look far to see the value of an independent in Washington. "All four on Mount Rushmore, they were all independents at one critical point in their career," Pressler claimed. (Hat tip to Bloomberg Politics reporter Dave Weigel for first tweeting the quote.) At PolitiFact, we often catch politicians misattributing quotes and facts to the founding fathers and other iconic presidents. Is this one of those cases, or were the four men on Mount Rushmore — George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt — each independents at one point in their careers? An independent, in political speak, is a candidate that is not affiliated with a party, just like how Pressler is running. As you’ll see, once again, presidential history tops presidential lore. George Washington Our nation’s first president was elected unanimously to two terms by the electoral college without a party affiliation. In fact, he hated the political parties that developed within his administration, said Mary Thompson, research historian at the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon. A political party system more reminiscent of today did not develop until the 1830s, but within Washington’s cabinet, Alexander Hamilton, his secretary of treasury, and Thomas Jefferson, the secretary of state, created warring factions — Federalists and so-called Jeffersonian Republicans — that sparred over important issues of the day. In his 1796 farewell address, Washington denounced the formation of political parties as "likely, in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion." In that sense, it might be fair to say Washington was our only truly independent president. But, Thompson said, it’s more complicated. "It is probably okay to call him ‘an independent,’ even though he often sided with the Federalist Party and thought most like them on major issues of the day," Thompson said. This included the formation of the national bank and the need for a strong central government. Thomas Jefferson Jefferson, too, is a bit more complicated because political parties were not prominent during his entire political career. In 1779, while on diplomatic assignment to France, he spoke poorly of parties. "I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in any thing else where I was capable of thinking for myself," he wrote. However, that changed once Washington named him the country’s first secretary of state in 1790 and "he became embroiled in the politics of the 1790s," said Gaye Wilson, Shannon Senior Historian at the Robert H. Smith International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello. Jefferson is widely credited, along with James Madison, for starting the Democratic-Republican Party to combat the Federalists of the time. In 1795, he justified the formation of this party: "Where the principle of difference is as substantial and as strongly pronounced as between the republicans & the Monocrats (Federalists) of our country I hold it as honorable to take a firm and decided part, and as immoral to pursue a middle line," he wrote. Perhaps before his national political career began and during a time largely void of parties, Jefferson was not affiliated with one. However, "by the time he is serving as vice president and then president, his affiliation with the Democratic-Republicans is very clear," Wilson said. Abraham Lincoln Not only was Lincoln never an independent, as one would use it today, "Lincoln was a devoted party man," said Michael Burlingame, the distinguished chair in Lincoln Studies at the University of Illinois Springfield. "A free people, in times of peace and quiet — when pressed by no common danger — naturally divide into parties. At such times, the man who is of neither party, is not — cannot be, of any consequence," Lincoln said in his eulogy of Kentucky Sen. Henry Clay. Lincoln did, however, switch parties, though only out of necessity. Between 1832 and 1856, Lincoln was a member of the Whig party, which by that time was dying out. "He was so reluctant to leave the Whigs, he was one of the last prominent Whigs to leave the party," said Sidney Milkis, political science professor at the University of Virginia and author of The President and the Parties: The Transformation of the American Party System Since the New Deal. Lincoln joined the Republican Party in 1856 and remained a member until 1864. That's when Lincoln ran for a second term as president as part of the National Union Party, "the name the Republicans adopted (during the Civil War) to appeal to more Democratic voters," said Burlingame, author of several Lincoln biographies. But Lincoln never ran as an independent for president or even as a third-party candidate. "Of all those guys on that list, Lincoln is the most dedicated partisan," said Milkis. Theodore Roosevelt While Roosevelt did wage an unsuccessful presidential campaign as a third-party candidate, historians we spoke with adamantly refuted that he was, at any point, an independent. "He was never an independent," said John Cooper, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin and author of The Warrior and the Priest: Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt. "He was always a party man. The question was, ‘Which party?’ " Cooper and Milkis both noted that in 1884, many of the Republican elites so much detested their party’s presidential nominee, James Blaine, that they left the party and supported the candidacy of Democrat Grover Cleveland for president instead. Roosevelt, however, who also did not like Blaine, stuck with the party and was denounced for it. Roosevelt was the vice presidential candidate on the successful Republican ticket led by William McKinley in 1900. McKinley was assassinated in 1901, making Roosevelt president. He again ran for president, and won, as a Republican in 1904. However, after his term, he grew agitated with his handpicked successor, William Taft, who he believed was catering to the conservative wing of the party instead of continuing to move it in a progressive direction. So Roosevelt decided to run for president again in 1912, this time on the Progressive party ticket. But this wasn’t some nascent effort. Roosevelt recruited candidates nationwide, even in statehouse races, to join the party. He became the only third-party candidate to finish second in a presidential election. "It was probably the most important political third party of American history," Milkis said. "But he did not run as an independent." Our ruling Pressler, an independent, said, "All four on Mount Rushmore, they were independents at one point in their career." It would be an effective campaign pitch, particularly in the home state of the iconic monument, but alas, it’s rubble. Of the four, Washington is probably the one with the most independent bona fides. You can perhaps make the case Jefferson was an independent "at one point" very early when parties were less common, but he went on to prominently serve as a Democratic-Republican — a party he helped found — as both vice president and president. However, there is no gray area when it comes to Lincoln and Roosevelt. Both switched parties, but were always affiliated with one and spoke of their importance. They never ran nor served as independents. We rate the statement False.	None	Larry Pressler	None	None	None	2014-10-16T16:29:22	2014-10-16	['None']
pomt-14262	"Rhode Island: 3% bigger at low tide."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2016/apr/10/hilary-treadwell/rhode-island-small-not-small/	After Rhode Island’s proposed "Cooler & Warmer" slogan tanked, many small-state natives threw their own catchphrases into the mix. Enter artist Hilary Treadwell, who sells a quirky T-shirt on her website, Lilhop.com. "Rhode Island: 3% bigger at low tide." Naturally, we asked Treadwell how she came up with this number. That’s what fact checkers do. She said she made it up. "I just like the number three, it’s big enough, but small enough," she said. "It’s a joke that speaks to a truth." She did look up the state’s area, and the length of its coastline and fiddled around with the numbers, but couldn’t get much farther. "I would love to know what it really is," she said. "I’m a math nerd, but non-scientific math." So we dug in. We quickly discovered this is a tough question, and after tinkering with the Rhode Island Geographic Information System Geospatial Data Catalog for a few hours, we called for backup. Chuck Labash and Michael Bradley, who work at the University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center, say an accurate calculation would require a Ph.d. or master’s-level study into shallow water bathymetry (the science of underwater depth) and an analysis of Rhode Island’s tides. You would need to establish what low-tide measurement to use — Lowest Astronomical Tide, Mean Low Water, or Mean Lower Low Water — then you’d have to check every point in the state at that designated low tide. Or, you could commission a light detection and ranging airplane flight and measure all of the state’s shores using lasers and sensors within the span of the average hour-long low tide period. But this would cost "hundreds of thousands of dollars," according to Bradley. We didn’t think our bosses would bankroll that kind of research. We turned to Bryan Oakley, a geoscientist who studies glacial, coastal, and marine depositional environments at Eastern Connecticut State University. He was able to give us rough some numbers. Rhode Island is about 1,000 square miles, if you don’t include the water, as the state does in its 1,214 square mile figure. A 3-percent increase in size would be about 30 square miles, or roughly the size of Cranston. "This seems a tad unrealistic to me," Oakley said. Here’s Oakley’s cocktail-napkin analysis: Rhode Island has 400 miles of coastline. The intertidal zone, or the area on the shore covered at high tide and uncovered at low tide, is at most 50 feet wide. The fluctuation in size between tides is about 3.7 square miles at most, making the state .37 percent bigger at low tide, he said. These numbers, he told us, are very rough and his guess is that Rhode Island is about .1 percent bigger at low tide. Labash and Bradley agreed. So did Jim Turenne, a soil scientist for the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service. Our Ruling: On T-shirts and postcards, Treadwell writes: "Rhode Island: 3% bigger at low tide." She admits making that up. "It’s like I know we’re weird and have problems but hey, we’re still here," Treadwell said. Besides, who would buy a T-shirt saying: "Rhode Island: 0.1% bigger at low tide?" Nevertheless, it’s ruling time and this is certainly a ridiculous (although fanciful) claim.

pomt-05261	An "Obamacare slush fund" paid to spay and neuter dogs and cats, then counted it as an "anti-obesity campaign."	false	/florida/statements/2012/may/30/allen-west/allen-west-says-obamacare-slush-fund-was-being-use/	Correction: We mistakenly published this item May 29, 2012, as a Mostly False when we had concluded it was False. We have corrected the ruling below. The item is otherwise unchanged. Put down your hot dogs and doughnuts and listen up: Americans have gotten fat. And we’ve heard advice from that fit First Lady about how to lighten up -- eat our veggies and get moving. But U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., has gotten wind of a wacky federally-funded strategy to slim our bulging waistlines: spaying dogs and cats. West listed examples of fiscal "absurdity" in a mid-May newsletter. "ObamaCare Slush Fund Money Being Use To Spay Stray Dogs And Cats – Counts As An Anti-Obesity Campaign," the newsletter stated, and then quoted a few sentences from an April 30, 2012, Washington Examiner story about a program in Nashville. The article said an anti-obesity "slush fund" under "Obamacare" was used in Nashville to promote spaying dogs and cats, because stray dogs were scaring people from exercising outdoors. The newspaper’s story prompted comments from readers angry about the reported misuse of federal dollars, one defending the right to be obese, and another predicting that pets will want the right to marry each other. This claim was spreading on the Internet faster than fleas on a dog, so we decided to check it out: Was any money from the federal health care law used to spay dogs and cats and billed as an anti-obesity program for people? Federal program helped Nashville hire animal control officers The story begins in 2010, when the federal government granted stimulus money to communities to decrease obesity and improve levels of nutrition and exercise. An initial 44 programs got money through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included a health care prevention and wellness component. The Nashville/Davidson County Metro Health Department was one of the groups that received money through the federal program, called Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW). Nashville received about $7.5 mllion. More than one-quarter of adults there are obese. The grant helped pay for free bikes in city parks, hiring a coordinator for urban gardens, and ensuring Head Start children had access to healthy food and exercise. Some projects are still in the works, including adding kiosks in urban areas for people to rent bikes, said Alisa Haushalter, Nashville’s project director. A small portion of the grant related to animals. Haushalter said that the federal grant included about $175,000 for two animal control officers and a program specialist. The goal was to decrease loose dogs and educate the public about animal care. Nashville targeted two low-income zip codes that generated the highest numbers of complaints to animal control. Around the same time, the Nashville Humane Association received a $35,000 grant for spay/neuter clinics in those areas from PetSmart Charities. Humane association executive director Joy Beach told us that the association doesn’t get money from the city of Nashville and gets most of its money from private donations plus a $1,000 state grant. The association did not receive any money from the federal Communities Putting Prevention to Work grant for the pet clinic, Beach said. So no federal money went to pet spaying and neutering. There is a connection, though, between the stimulus grant and the clinics. The animal control officers hired through the grant attended the clinics -- similar to how police officers attend community events. The grant also covered the salary of a program specialist who initially helped promote the clinics, said health department spokesman Brian Todd. We asked the Centers for Disease Control, which oversees the grant program, if any stimulus money went to spay or neuter pets in Nashville and we received a succinct response: "No," wrote Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman. If the money for the pet clinics came from PetSmart Charities and the humane association, what fueled this rumor that an Obamacare slush fund was paying for it? Promotional materials were unclear When officials in Nashville promoted the program, their information wasn’t always clear about the funding. Some of the publicity omitted that the pet clinics were paid for through a PetSmart Charities grant. Other documents listed multiple partners, including the stimulus project, making it appear that it did pay for the clinic. Some information was vague -- the city’s website said that the stimulus program would help Nashville "address loose dogs." Not surprisingly, some of the news coverage stated that the stimulus grant would pay for the pet clinics. The Tennessean wrote in March 2011: "A free clinic for dogs and cats is opening in East Nashville — but the goal is improving people's health." It was the Washington Examiner article that helped make dog clinics into a hot topic beyond Nashville. "A controversial anti-obesity ‘slush fund’ under Obamacare was used in Nashville, Tennessee, to promote spaying dogs and cats," the report said. "The reasoning: stray dogs scare people from exercising outdoors." Todd, the health department spokesman, sought a correction from the newspaper. Todd told the reporter in an email (which he forwarded to PolitiFact) that as part of the stimulus grant, the health department partnered with the humane association, and that the federal grant paid for the animal control officers who attended the clinics to provide education. But the spay/neuter services were provided by the humane association and PetSmart charities, he said. The Examiner article included this correction on May 7: "The Nashville Health Department said that the funding did not pay for the spaying, but instead was used to promote the anti-obesity effort that included the neutering campaign. Also it funded the hiring of two animal control officers ‘for the purpose of increasing animal control presence and enforcement in neighborhoods where we knew there was a loose dog problem.’" Republicans cry foul about pet clinics Shortly after the Examiner article, the claim about an "ObamaCare slush fund" being used to spay and neuter animals started spreading. The U.S. House of Representatives Education and Workforce Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee issued press releases that cited the Nashville pet clinic as an example of misguided spending: "Bearing out the infamous declaration that we would have to pass the health care law to find out what was in it, Congress and the American people have recently begun taking a closer look at a massive new spending program known colloquially as the Obamacare ‘slush fund,’ " stated the energy committee’s press release. The dollars for doggies claim led to a spat between lawmakers at a May 9 committee hearing. "Incredibly, this same program also funded free pet spaying and neutering," said Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Ocala. "While a laudable goal, the Department of Health and Human Services should focus its limited resources on human health." Stearns pointed to the Recovery.gov website, which included two updates about Nashville’s grant that included pet clinics. "Services to a high-need area occurred to provide free spay/neuter and wellness clinics for dogs and cats in order to curb animals running at large," stated one update. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., told Stearns that the pet clinic claim was wrong and cited a blog by The Hill that stated that the clinic was paid for with the PetSmart Charities grant. We contacted West's office for comment on this report, but we didn't hear back. Haushalter told us in an email: "Since this project was comprehensive and leveraged partner resources, we reported on the entire project. In retrospect, and upon review of a variety of documents/reports, I understand that there are several communications that may be vague or less clear than desired. However, I can assure you ARRA funds were not used to pay for spay/neuter or vet services." Our ruling West said in a May 14 newsletter that among examples of "absurdity" in our country was this: "ObamaCare Slush Fund Money Being Use To Spay Stray Dogs And Cats – Counts As An Anti-Obesity Campaign." Publicity information, news coverage and even the federal government’s own website about the stimulus did suggest that taxpayers paid for pets to get spayed or neutered as part of an effort to help people exercise outdoors free from the threat of stray dogs. There is a connection between the federal money and the clinics. A program specialist whose salary was paid for through the grant promoted the clinics, and the grant-funded animal control officers were on hand at the clinics. But it’s not accurate to say that the money was used to spay or neuter the animals. And the money did not come from an "Obamacare slush fund" -- it wasn't part of the health care law. Calling it a "slush fund" could lead readers to view it as a secretive stash of money, when in reality Congress approved the stimulus act that included money for community-based prevention. Information about the communities that got the grant is publicly available online. Finally, by the time West made his claim, The Hill and Congressional Quarterly had both reported that the initial claims were wrong. In fact, PetSmart Charities gave the humane association $35,000 to pay for pet neutering and spaying. We rate this claim False.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2012-05-30T16:44:05	2012-05-14	['None']
pomt-00978	A Texas law says "that you can’t shoot bears out of the second floor of a window."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/feb/12/alcee-hastings/floridas-alcee-hastings-says-texas-law-forbids-sho/	Crazy ol’ Texas, a Democratic congressman from Florida said and reaffirmed last week, initially noting the Republican-led Lone Star state left it to the federal government to set up its online marketplace for residents to shop for health insurance in keeping with the Obamacare law. How crazy? There’s a Texas law, said Rep. Alcee Hastings, who represents a South Florida district, restricting the number of dildos a person may buy; Mostly False, PolitiFact Florida found. In an interview with CNN, Hastings also let loose that there's a Texas law "that you can't shoot bears out of the second floor of a window." We spotted the bear comment in CNN’s Feb. 5, 2015, news story; it came from the network’s telephone interview of Hastings. Whoa (or whatever it is Floridians holler when they’re riding their gators). We left messages with Hastings’ office and didn’t hear back. Next, we rang up Mike Cox, Austin-based spokesman for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, who offered his own whoa. In Texas, Cox said, "you can’t shoot bears," from any location. "You can’t shoot them from the second floor, you can’t shoot them from the first floor, you can’t shoot them from the 23rd floor. You flat can’t shoot them." There’s this in a TPWD bear guide for hunters: "It is a violation of law to kill a black bear in Texas, with penalties of up to $10,000, added civil restitution fines, jail time and loss of all hunting privileges." Another snippet in the leaflet: "The black bear is a protected and rare species in the state of Texas." And we saw this on another department web page about Texas hunting regulations: "Black bears are protected and cannot be hunted or killed." Separately to our inquiry, Jon English, an attorney for the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, said the second-floor window claim reminded him of another myth about Texas barring hunters from firing at buffalo from the second story of a hotel. Similarly, a librarian at the Legislative Reference Library in the Texas Capitol replied by email that its researchers didn’t find evidence of a law restricting bear-shooting from the second story. We identified one instance in which a person may shoot a bear in Texas. Under the state’s penal code, it’s a defense to prosecution for a person to shoot a dangerous wild animal, including a bear, in a public place if they have reasonable fear of bodily injury. Our ruling Hastings said a Texas law says "that you can’t shoot bears out of the second floor of a window." We failed to learn where he heard or read this. His contention that Texas is so crazy that it has a second-floor bear-shooting law is flat wrong. Texas has no such law. Instead, it forbids hunting of bears, a protected species regardless of the windows they're standing under. From the windowed second floor of the Austin American-Statesman’s building, we find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-12972	"Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/23/paul-ryan/repeal-and-replace-works-paul-ryan-says-obamacare-/	As U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan discussed the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, a top priority of President-elect Donald Trump, he made a claim about the financial health of Medicare. "What people don’t realize is, because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke," the Wisconsin Republican told Fox News host Bret Baier on Nov. 10, 2016. The Affordable Care Act certainly has its detractors. When Ryan claimed the same month that Obamacare is not a popular law, our rating was Mostly True. The polls generally showed most Americans had an unfavorable opinion of it. But surprisingly for Ryan, who is regarded as a federal budget expert, his claim about the law flies in the face of evidence that it actually helps shore up Medicare. What the ACA did on Medicare https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7de6b429-1d9a-42de-ad08-c7998eaa6ca5 Here’s how Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, lays it out: On one side of the ledger, Obamacare slowed the growth of Medicare spending by, among other things, reducing increases in payments made to nearly all health care providers. On the other side of the ledger, the law included a surtax on high-income earners that brings more money into Medicare. Two health care policy experts further told us that the combination of spending curbs and revenue increases for Medicare Part A -- which covers hospital, nursing home and home care services, and is financed mainly through payroll taxes -- has extended the solvency of Medicare. (Medicare Part B, which is voluntary, covers doctor visits and some medical care.) Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at the University of Southern California, pointed us to an October 2016 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The report noted that in 2010, the Medicare trustees projected that Obamacare’s spending curbs and revenue increases would mean Medicare’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which finances Part A, would remain solvent until 2029. That’s 12 years later than had been projected a year before the Affordable Care Act became law. (The projection has since been revised to 2028.) Michael Sparer, a professor health policy and management at Columbia University in New York, put it this way, financially speaking: If Obamacare were repealed completely, "it would put Medicare in worse shape, not better shape." Finally, it’s worth noting that both Factcheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker also concluded that Ryan’s claim is wrong. They both also noted that, even if the Part A trust fund did become depleted in 2028, the program wouldn’t be broke, in that it is still set up to cover an estimated 87 percent of expenses. FactCheck.org’s rating was false and the Fact Checker gave Ryan its worst rating, four Pinnocchios, which is for statements deemed to be "whoppers." Ryan’s office opted not to provide us any information to support his claim. Our rating Ryan said: "Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke." Financially, Medicare isn’t entirely in the clear, given that actuaries project that a key reserve fund will run out of money in 2028. But the Medicare trustees themselves, along with a host of experts, say the Affordable Care Act’s changes to Medicare -- including holding the line on spending and raising taxes -- actually puts Medicare in better shape than before the law was adopted. That’s a long way from making Medicare go broke. We rate Ryan’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-03836	Says indoor workers get "less UV than outdoor workers, but they get more melanomas."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/16/joseph-levy/are-indoor-workers-more-likely-get-melanoma-despit/	Oregon lawmakers are pondering a bill that would prohibit teenagers from hopping into professional tanning beds, unless they have an order from a doctor saying it’s OK. House Bill 2896, which cleared the Oregon House, has bipartisan support and the staunch backing of public health and cancer specialists, who say that teen tanners are at high risk of developing melanoma. They spoke passionately at a recent legislative hearing. Also at the hearing was Joseph Levy, executive director of International Smart Tan Network. And he wasn’t having any of that anti-tanning bed testimony. He mounted a spirited defense of his industry, denying that there is a "straightforward relationship" between melanoma and ultraviolet light. "That would be impossible. Indoor workers get 3 to 9 times less UV than outdoor workers, but they get more melanomas. The proponents of the bill have not acknowledged that very important caveat. It is not disputed. The World Health Organization recognizes it," he said. PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know if indoor workers have higher rates of melanoma than outdoor workers, who are exposed every working day to UV light from the sun. And if so, does that necessarily upend the link between exposure and cancer? Because that is how Levy was using the statistic -- to make the larger point that more UV does not necessarily mean more cancer, so there’s no need to keep teens from tanning beds. UV and cancer UV is indisputably a carcinogen, like alcohol and tobacco. Exposure doesn’t necessarily lead to skin cancer, but the chances go up. Medical experts say there are lots of factors that determine who develops cancer, including genetics. Freckled fair-skinned redheads with many moles, for example, are at greater risk than olive-complected people without moles. Still, leading health organizations all agree that people should limit exposure to the sun: Wear a hat, apply sunscreen, cover up limbs. Tanning beds have UV rays, just like sunshine. Is Levy right about melanoma rates being higher among indoor workers over outdoor workers? He sent over two documents, one an abstract of a 1990 study of sunlight exposure and melanoma in the U.S. Navy. The other is a one-page fact sheet from the Smart Tan Educational Institute, quoting the World Health Organization and listing a number of study citations. Neither provided enough clarity for PolitiFact Oregon. With the help of the Internet, we found a 2011 research article by Dianne E. Godar, a chemist with the Food and Drug Administration. In the introduction, she writes that "although outdoor workers get three to 10 times the annual UV dose that indoor workers get, they have similar or lower incidences of cutaneous malignant melanoma." CMM, as it’s called, is a dangerous form of melanoma that can spread if not treated. The author gives three reasons for why this might be: One, people who work indoors are exposed to high concentrations of sunlight on holiday or on weekends, resulting in sunburns that may lay the groundwork for skin cancer. Two, these people work inside offices where they receive sunlight filtered through windows. The windows allow in gene-mutating UVA wavelengths, which promote cancer development, but block out Vitamin D-making UVB, which ward off tumor development. Who knew? The World Health Organization shares that line of reasoning: "Tumour development may be linked to occasional exposure to short periods of intense sunlight, such as at weekends or on holiday. The higher incidence of malignant melanoma in indoor workers compared to outdoor workers supports that notion." So, it’s not that indoor workers are avoiding the sun; it’s that they’re getting the wrong kind of sun in the worst possible way. We reached out to Godar but were not able to communicate with her directly. An FDA spokeswoman provided a statement, which reads in part: "Melanoma incidence has consistently been associated with intense, intermittent sun exposure as opposed to chronic sun exposure such as that received by some outdoor workers." We also reached out to Joseph Levy, to let him know that it’s not just a matter of indoor workers receiving less light. We reminded him that the WHO quote -- which his group uses -- suggests a link between tumors and exposure to shorter rounds of intense sunlight. He suggested PolitiFact Oregon did not understand what he was saying. "The NATURE of the relationship between UV and melanoma is not understood. There are theories (such as the theory that sunburn or perhaps intermittent exposures may be the issue) but they are just that: theories," he wrote. So he’s OK with the numbers, but not OK with the theories. We also checked with Dr. Brian Druker, director of the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University. Druker agrees with Levy that this is a complex issue and that genetics play a role. But Druker says the "weight of the medical evidence" is clear: Exposure to sun increases the risk of skin cancer. As for Levy’s use of the indoor workers statistic? "That was a complete distortion of why that risk was higher," Druker said. The ruling: Levy is using the finding -- that indoor workers have higher rates of melanoma than outdoor workers -- to try to derail legislation that would make tanning beds off-limits to teenagers, who have more susceptible skin. His statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. The theory for the element of truth is that indoor workers have higher rates of melanoma than outdoor workers because of the way they are exposed to sun, and to types of sun rays. We find that’s information that would make readers think twice about tanning beds as benign. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-13172	"We’ve spent $6 trillion" on the wars in the Middle East.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/27/donald-trump/did-us-spend-6-trillion-middle-east-wars/	Donald Trump repeated his call to "drain the swamp," knocking the "failed elites in Washington" for being wrong about everything from foreign policy to health care. "The people opposing us are the same people — and think of this — who’ve wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East — we could have rebuilt our country twice — that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering – imagine if that money had been spent at home," Trump said at a Oct. 26 rally in Charlotte, N.C. "We’ve spent $6 trillion, lost thousands of lives," Trump said. "You could say hundreds of thousands of lives, because look at the other side also." The United States has listed nearly 7,000 casualties from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. For this fact-check, however, we wanted to focus on Trump’s claim that the United States has spent $6 trillion on the wars. Is that right? What we found is that Trump confused what’s been spent, and what is projected to be spent. That said, he’s right to note the large cost of U.S. intervention in the Middle East. The Congressional Research Service estimated in 2014 that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (mainly the cost of operations) had cost the United States about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. Here’s the breakdown: • $686 billion for Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) • $815 billion for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn • $27 billion for Operation Noble Eagle, enhancing security at military bases • $81 billion for programs and activities not directly related to war operations But those figures only include direct expenditures. More comprehensive analyses show trillions of dollars in additional spending. A recent Brown University study, for example, pinned the cost of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria at about $3.6 trillion from 2001 to 2016, using the $1.6 trillion operations costs as a baseline but also accounting for counterterrorism costs. Adding in money appropriated for war spending and on homeland security in 2017, the total reaches $4.79 trillion. This figure also includes future obligations for veterans medical and disability costs ($1 trillion through 2053) as well as interest on borrowing for wars. Here’s a specific breakdown from the study: A 2013 Harvard University working paper came up with an even higher cost: $4 trillion to $6 trillion for just Iraq and Afghanistan. Like the Brown study, the Harvard paper estimated that future medical care and disability benefits for veterans of these war will near $1 trillion. The Harvard paper also attributes $750 billion in Pentagon medical and personnel costs to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and also considers the cost of nation-building in the two countries. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said the wars in the Middle East have cost $6 trillion dollars. Trump is citing the high-end estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet he is confusing money that’s been spent with money that researchers say will be spent. That’s a $1 trillion difference or more. Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-15112	"She [Hillary Clinton] has also said unequivocally that she didn't receive classified documents."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/sep/13/david-cicilline/cicillines-mistake-was-describing-hillary-clinton-/	On WPRI’s "Newsmakers" show on Sept. 4, co-hosts Ted Nesi and Tim White asked U.S. Rep. David Cicilline about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal server for work-related email when she was secretary of state. Cicilline emphasized that Clinton herself acknowledged that she "didn’t handle this well." He lamented that "early on" Clinton hadn’t succeeded in an effort "to put it to rest." He suggested that the effect on Clinton’s campaign has been "unfortunate" and "regrettable." "The secretary has acknowledged that having a separate server was a bad idea," he said. Cicilline added: "She has also said unequivocally that she didn't receive classified documents." Voters tend to like politicians who are unequivocal about things. The Random House dictionary defines unequivocal as not equivocal, unambiguous, clear and having only one possible meaning or interpretation. It also means absolute, unqualified; not subject to conditions or exception. We wondered if Clinton has actually been "unequivocal" in her comments about not receiving classified documents on her personal server, so we gathered together some video clips. One of those clips was from early March -- just after The New York Times broke the news that the candidate had used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state and that her advisers had reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails and decided which ones to provide to the State Department for record-keeping purposes. On March 10, Clinton took some questions from reporters on C-SPAN. One reporter asked her: "Were you ever specifically briefed on the security implications of using your own email server and using your personal address to email with the president?" Her response was: "I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material. So I certainly am well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material." This was certainly unequivocal, especially the assertion that "There is no classified material." But later we found Clinton’s statements veered from "unambiguous, clear and having only one possible meaning or interpretation." In footage that CNN posted online on July 28, Clinton said, "First let me say that I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received." "At the time it was sent and received" seems to us to be open to more than one possible meaning, especially when compared to her statement in March. Then, on Aug. 15, speaking at the Iowa State Fair, Clinton said: "... The facts are the same as they have been from the very beginning of these questions being raised. Most importantly, I never sent classified material on my email. And I never received any that was marked classified." In March, Clinton was saying there was no classified material, regardless of how it was marked. Now, she was allowing for the possibility that there might have been some material that was actually classified -- but just not "marked" that way. In stories parsing her August comments, in which she uses the phrase "marked classified," The Wall Street said she had shifted her emphasis. The Boston Globe said she had qualified her position. We asked a spokesman for Clinton, Josh Schwerin, if the candidate agrees with Cicilline's statement, particularly his use of the word unequivocally. "We'll let her past statements on the matter speak for themselves," Schwerin said in an email. We also asked Cicilline’s spokesman, Richard Luchette, to provide his evidence that Clinton has said "unequivocally" that she didn’t receive classified documents. Luchette provided a series of quotes that reflect the same evolution we’ve tracked. It’s a chain of quotes that begins with Clinton’s quite unequivocal statement from March. It ends with the more recent statements, which are qualified, including this one: "As has been confirmed repeatedly by the inspectors general, over and over, I did not send or receive any material marked classified." There’s that word "marked" again. Our ruling Ten days ago, Cicilline said Hillary Clinton "has also said unequivocally that she didn't receive classified documents." Cicilline set a high bar for himself when he used the word "unequivocally." Certainly in March she was unequivocal. But the record also shows that since then she has hedged and qualified her remarks, as has been noted in the media. The problem for Cicilline is that the definition of unequivocal doesn’t leave much, if any, wiggle room: Think "clear and having only one possible meaning or interpretation." Because Cicilline’s statement was accurate in regard to Clinton’s quote from March, but failed to provide the context of Clinton’s subsequent elaborations, the judges rate Cicilline’s claim Half True.

pomt-07553	Discretionary spending has "increased over 20-some percent in two years if you don’t include the stimulus. If you put in the stimulus, it’s over 80 percent."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/01/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-discretionary-spending-20-percent/	House Majority Leader Eric Cantor rarely passes an opportunity to brand President Barack Obama as a reckless spender. During a March 17 interview on Fox News, the Virginia Republican said Obama "missed the opportunity" to cut spending in the 2012 federal budget he sent to Congress this winter. Cantor complained Obama’s proposal would merely freeze discretionary spending. "That’s after it’s increased by over 20-some percent over the last two years if you don’t include the stimulus," he told host Greta Van Susteren. "If you put the stimulus in, it’s over 80 percent." We checked his numbers. First, an explanation: Discretionary spending is the money Congress controls through annual appropriations. It goes for services such as defense, education, health and housing. In contrast, mandatory spending is used for entitlement programs with required levels of funding -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Ray Allen, a political adviser to Cantor, said the congressman was referring to non-defense discretionary spending. He also said Cantor, in discussing spending "over the last two years" is referring to a period that begins with Obama’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2009. PolitiFact is no stranger to the set of numbers Cantor used. They also have been cited by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., chairman of the House Budget Committee. The figures, culled from the Congressional Budget Office, can be traced to a Ryan news release last June. Although several budget experts we spoke to quibbled about the exact figures Cantor used, the raw numbers are not really in dispute. His computations of those numbers, however, have problems. The numbers show non-defense discretionary spending rose from $434 billion in fiscal 2008 to $537 billion in fiscal 2010. That’s a 23.7 percent jump -- consistent with the "20-some percent" increase Cantor claimed. Cantor does not provide an historical perspective to those numbers, so we will. In the eight federal budgets approved during Republican George W. Bush’s administration -- non-defense discretionary spending increased by an average 9.6 percent each year. During the first two years of the Obama administration, it has grown by an annual average of 11.9 percent. Non-defense discretionary spending adds up to about one-sixth of expenditures in the federal budget. Even if it was completely eliminated, the nation would still run an estimated $820 billion deficit this fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Now, let’s move to the $787 billion stimulus package, approved by the Democratic-controlled Congress in 2009 with hopes that a federal injection of money would jolt the economy out of recession. A third of the money -- $259 billion -- was appropriated for discretionary uses. Cantor adds all of the $259 billion to the $537 billion in discretionary spending for 2010. That gives him a total of $796 billion in discretionary spending for fiscal 2010. And if you compare it to the $434 billion in 2008, it’s an 83.4 percent increase -- consistent with the "over 80 percent" he claimed. But there are a few catches. First, not everyone agrees it’s appropriate to include stimulus money in the calculation since it could be considered one-time emergency spending -- not part of the budget base. Cantor seemed to acknowledge that point by saying, "If you put the stimulus in, it’s over 80 percent." We also wondered why Cantor counted the $257 billion in 2010. After all, the stimulus was approved in 2009. Allen said Cantor lumped the stimulus money into fiscal 2010 because that’s the year most of it was spent. "When something passed is irrelevant," Allen said. "What matters is when it’s spent." Several budget experts said Allen’s point is valid. So we went back to the spread sheets and encountered a problem: We found no one, including Cantor, who could produce data showing the exact yearly expenditures of non-discretionary stimulus funds. But we did find two tables that suggest Cantor’s contention that all of the money was spent in 2010 is faulty. A 2009 analysis of the stimulus bill by the Congressional Budget Office said the discretionary money would be doled out over a number of years, with 36 percent being spent in 2010. The CBO published an updated estimate of stimulus spending in January. It indicates that about 34 percent of the "budgetary effects" of the discretionary portion came in 2010. To assume that obligated money has been spent is incorrect. So let’s suppose 35 percent is the actual figure. That would mean Cantor, under his formula, should have applied only $90 billion of stimulus to last year’s discretionary spending total -- not the full $257 billion. It would mean discretionary spending, if you include the stimulus, increased 44 percent during the first two years of the Obama administration -- far shy of the "over 80 percent" Cantor claimed. Allen disputed our calculus, saying only a tiny portion remained unspent at the end of 2010. He referred to CBO documents from earlier this year saying all but about $5 billion in discretionary stimulus money has been "obligated." The CBO defines obligations as "a legally binding commitment by the federal government that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future." Contrary to the claim of Cantor’s camp, the CBO documents do not prove most of the money was spent in 2010. One of the reports, in fact, says "most of the discretionary funding provided by ARRA (the stimulus) has been obligated, although outlays may occur in 2011 and later years." Let’s review: Cantor said discretionary spending has "increased over 20-some percent in two years if you don’t include the stimulus. If you put in the stimulus, it’s over 80 percent." Without the stimulus, discretionary spending increased 23.7 percent. So is Cantor right on that part. But the majority leader runs into trouble when he starts counting discretionary stimulus funds. Cantor generates his high percentage by lumping in all of the $257 million approved for discretionary stimulus use into 2010 spending. CBO reports indicate that only slightly more than a third of the discretionary stimulus was spent last year. That suggests that when you add in the stimulus, discretionary spending increased 44 percent during the first two years of the Obama administration -- not "over 80 percent" as Cantor says. Cantor’s statement is half right and half wrong. We’ll split the difference and rate it Half True.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2011-04-01T12:54:52	2011-03-17	['None']

pomt-06631	"Ten years ago the Austin Water Utility used a total of 240.3 million gallons. Every summer since then our peak day of water use has been lower."	true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/17/save-our-springs-alliance/save-our-springs-says-water-utility-customers-have/	Crediting conservation in Austin, the Save Our Springs Alliance said in an Aug. 16, 2011, entry in its online newsletter: "Ten years ago the Austin Water Utility used a total of 240.3 million gallons. Every summer since then our peak day of water use has been lower." After noting that this year’s peak water use in a day was 217 million gallons, the entry continues: "So raise a tall glass of ice water in honor of our success: water conservation gains have outpaced population growth for a decade. Add a ‘Salud!’ to another 10 years of flat or declining water use — easily achieved with cost-effective conservation measures and an emerging ‘culture of conservation,’ one that recognizes that we can thrive and be happy without oversized, overwatered New England-style turf grass lawns." We can’t check on the next decade, but we can check if peak water usage has been less every year than what it was in 2001. Indeed, the Austin Water Utility sent us figures indicating that on the peak days of water consumption from 2002 through August 2011, customers used less water than the 240.3 million gallons used on Aug. 13, 2001, though that was barely so in one year. The greatest peak use day since 2001 was Aug. 26, 2006, when usage was 240.17 million gallons — about 5/100ths of a percent shy of the amount gulped, flushed and otherwise used in 2001. The lowest peak-use amount in the 10 years after 2001 was 176.98 million gallons on Aug. 13, 2007. Put another way, the average peak water use in a day in the period was about 214 million gallons, 11 percent off the 2001 peak. The utility’s director, Greg Meszaros, told us in an interview that conservation helps explain the lower peak-use amounts, though he said consumption generally bounces around year to year partly due to variations in the weather — rainy summers reduce demand — and the economy. Per-capita water consumption has been relatively flat, Meszaros said, since the utility instituted a conservation program in 2007 that, among features, encourages customers to use low-water appliances and limit lawn watering. According to the utility, customers have used less water per person lately than individuals did in past years. Per-capita daily use has averaged 190 gallons or more four times since 1990, the last time being 2006. Average per-person consumption slid to 151 gallons in 2007, reached 170 gallons in 2008 and then dipped two straight years, reaching less than 140 gallons in 2010. Daryl Slusher, an assistant director for the utility, said the average will approach 160 gallons for the year that ends Sept. 30. Save Our Springs maintains the area’s conservation successes demonstrate that a water treatment plant slated for Northwest Austin won’t be needed for many years. Meszaros told us Austin needs the new plant because two current plants can’t be relied on indefinitely. Also, he said, the new project will include a vital water transmission main easing the delivery of water to the fast-growing northern third of the utility’s service area. "We’re not doing (the new plant) just to meet a peak water demand," Meszaros said. In an interview, Bill Bunch, SOS’s executive director, expressed skepticism about strains in the existing water delivery system. He also said there’s not sufficient water demand to justify the new one and forwarded an April 2002 recommendation from city staff about preliminary engineering for the new plant. The document states the plant would be needed by 2009 to meet increasing water demands, predicting too that the utility’s peak one-day demand in summer 2009 would be 281 million gallons; the peak amount that year turned out to be 228 million gallons. Utility spokesman Kevin Buchman later told us by email that in 2002, the "main reason for moving forward with the construction of a new plant was to meet the projected demands." He said, though, the utility’s mid-decade focus on conservation allowed the city to postpone the plant’s completion by more than five years. "Also," Buchman said, "since 2002 we have had one of our (originally three) plants decommissioned and our other two water plants have been expanded as much as possible." We won’t try to settle the water plant debate here. But the alliance’s statement about peak water use rates True.	None	Save Our Springs Alliance	None	None	None	2011-09-17T06:00:00	2011-08-16	['None']
pomt-02502	Dollar General "added 2,500 stores and 20,000 jobs" during his four-year tenure as CEO.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/14/david-perdue/perdue-takes-aim-senate-seat-highlighting-his-doll/	David Perdue’s U.S. Senate campaign grabbed headlines with some punch lines about some of his fellow Republicans in the race. In case you missed it, Perdue’s first television commercial had four crying babies dressed in outfits with the first names of some of his opponents. It was an attempt to portray himself as the adult in the race. Perdue also highlighted his business acumen in the ad, making a claim about his record as Dollar General’s chief executive officer from when he joined the company in 2003 until he left the business in 2007 that we wanted to check out. "Four years later, the company added 2,500 stores and 20,000 jobs," he said. We wondered whether Perdue was exaggerating about his tenure at the Tennessee-based company or did he accurately portray his record at the business. For those of you who haven’t paid any attention to the Senate race and think his last name sounds familiar, David Perdue is not that Perdue, but they are kin. Former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue is David’s first cousin. David Perdue has carved out an impressive career of his own as a business turnaround specialist. He was a top executive at the clothing company Haggar and Sara Lee, which is best known for its poundcakes. He was the CEO of the sports apparel company Reebok, where he was credited with balancing the books. Dollar General has more than 11,000 stores in 40 states. There are currently 588 Dollar General stores in Georgia, more than any state except Texas. Perdue joined Dollar General in June 2003 and stayed there until July 2007. The company keeps annual financial statements on its website. While the reports did not exactly match the dates of Perdue’s tenure at Dollar General, the annual reports show his claim has merit. The annual reports note the company’s ambitious plans to open 600 to 800 stores a year. In most years during Perdue’s tenure, Dollar General exceeded those projections. On Feb. 28, 2003, Dollar General had 6,192 stores and an estimated 53,500 full-time and part-time employees. On March 4, 2007, the company had 8,260 stores and about 69,500 full-time and part-time employees. That’s a four-year increase of nearly 2,100 stores and 16,000 workers. Campaign spokesman Derrick Dickey said those reports are not a reliable measuring stick to examine the accuracy of Perdue’s statement for a few reasons. First, as we agreed with the campaign, those reports do not entirely match Perdue’s tenure. Second, Dickey said, the reports do not reflect the decisions Perdue made that may have affected the company’s performance. "The numbers we cited are based on our analysis of the added stores and jobs created that can be directly attributed to decisions made by David while he served as CEO of Dollar General," Dickey said via email. "In an abundance of caution, we used thoughtful, conservative estimates of both numbers." PolitiFact Georgia tried to compare the numbers for the first full year Perdue was in charge with his final year at Dollar General. The annual reports show Dollar General had 6,700 stores at the end of 2003 and 8,194 by the end of 2007. That’s an increase of about 1,400 stores. The number of additional employees totaled 13,700. So do we buy what this businessman says about his time at Dollar General? To sum up, Perdue said Dollar General added 2,500 stores and 20,000 jobs when he was the CEO.

pomt-08274	The debt is "nearly $6 trillion more than when President Obama was sworn into office."	false	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/09/george-allen/george-allen-says-national-debt-increased-6-trilli/	Former U.S. Sen. George Allen recently ripped Democrats for growing government and exploding the national debt. "Election Day 2010 saw the culmination of years of aggravation and resentment toward a federal government that became disconnected and disdainful of the values and priorities of Americans," Allen wrote in a Nov. 5 Op/Ed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "People are rightfully riled by bailouts of failed automobile manufacturers, health care dictates, energy restrictions, and the unprecedented expansion of government spending and dangerous debt -- nearly $6 trillion more than when President Obama was sworn into office." Whoa. Did he say $6 trillion more in debt? Since January 2009? That’s a statistic we hadn’t heard before. So we decided to look into it. According to the U.S. Treasury, the total national debt as of Jan. 31, 2009 -- 11 days after President Obama took office -- was $10.6 trillion. So, in order for Allen’s claim to be true on its face, the current publicly held debt would have to be about $16.6 trillion. Well, is it? Nope, not even close. The publicly held debt as of Oct. 31 was $13.7 trillion, almost $3 trillion short of Allen’s claim. Asked for a source, Tim Nussbaum, Allen’s executive assistant, cited an Oct. 18 CBS News report on the nation’s rising debt. That report also finds that the debt has risen by almost $3 trillion, but adds: "The administration has projected the national debt will soar in Mr. Obama's fourth year in office to nearly $16.5-trillion in 2012. That's more than 100 percent of the value of the nation's economy and $5.9-trillion above what it was his first day on the job." To check that, we turned to the Office of Management and Budget to to look at future debt estimates based on the current fiscal 2011 budget. If $16.335 trillion qualifies as "nearly $16.5 trillion," then the CBS report is right. But is Allen? Let’s take a look back to decide. Allen’s language in the Op/Ed plainly implies the Obama administration's actions have already caused the debt to rise $6 trillion. That’s simply wrong. The debt has risen by $3.1 trillion since Obama took office. For that reason, we find Allen’s claim to be False.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2010-11-09T12:47:55	2010-11-05	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-14702	Under Scott Walker, Wisconsin "moved from 16th to third in percentage of people with student loan debt."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jan/08/scot-ross/activist-claims-wisconsin-moved-16th-third-percent/	The liberal group One Wisconsin Now thinks college students should be given more flexibility to deal with their student loans. The group’s executive director Scot Ross highlighted that issue during a Dec. 13, 2015 appearance on "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a public affairs show on WISN-TV. During a discussion about Gov. Scott Walker’s future, Ross criticized the governor’s performance on a number of fronts. Under Walker, he said, Wisconsin is "last in the Midwest in job creation" and "we've moved from 16th to third in percentage of people with student loan debt." The lagging-in-jobs claim isn’t new. Democratic challenger Mary Burke used versions of the claim in her unsuccessful campaign against Walker in 2014. In March 2015, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, said the state "is dead last in the Midwest for job creation." We rated that Mostly True -- the state was tied for 9th place at the time. But what about Ross’ student-debt claim? Have Wisconsin college students leaped up the chart in how much they owe? And is it because of Walker, as Ross implied? When we asked Ross for backup, he wrote in an email: "I misread a number from my written show prep notes. It's 10th not 16th." He made a light-hearted suggestion at what rating he deserves, too: "Mostly Old." Alas, that’s not a category on the Truth-O-Meter. Ross said the data he cited came from the Institute for College Access & Success, an independent non-profit group. The group’s 2015 report said that state students owed an average of $28,810, a level that was No. 3 in the nation based on the percent of students. Some 70 percent of state students have college debt, the report said. The group’s report from 2012, reflecting data from 2011, the first year of Walker’s term, said state student debt averaged $26,238 and the state had a ranking of 10th in the nation. In 2011, 67 percent of state students had loans. (The average amount of debt ranked 16th in the nation, which might have been the source of the confusion for Ross.) So, while Ross got the numbers wrong, debt has increased for state students in the years Walker has been governor. Who’s to blame? The part of Ross’s claim that suggests student debt increased due to action by Walker is more problematic. In August 2015, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush claimed student loan debt had doubled under President Barack Obama. That was rated Half True. Experts said the level of debt was rising before Obama took office in 2009, due to the recession and other factors beyond the president’s control. The economic downturn pushed states to cut higher education funding, and schools increased tuition to cover costs, Donald Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University, told PolitiFact. Since 1980, private college tuition has increased about 200 percent, while public school tuition has increased about 300 percent, with the by far the biggest jump happening since 2008, according to College Board data compiled by Heller. The Federal Reserve put student debt nationally at about $1.3 trillion as of September 2015. That compares with $844 billion in 2010 and $640 billion in 2008, shortly after the economy crashed. Our rating Ross said that in the time Walker has led Wisconsin, student debt increased to third in the country. He acknowledged he got the number wrong, making the jump seem bigger than it was, but was correct that more state students have college loans. He’s less accurate about the implication that the increase in debt is due to Walker. To be sure there have been cuts to education and the UW System under Walker, but Ross offered no evidence that those cuts drove state students debt higher. And student debt nationally has increased sharply in the years he has been in office. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Scot Ross	None	None	None	2016-01-08T10:00:00	2015-12-13	['Wisconsin']
pomt-11305	In the wake of the Republican-backed tax bill, "more than 100,000 American workers have already been laid off in 2018."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/18/charles-schumer/senate-democrats-flub-statistic-layoffs-2018/	As Americans rushed to file their taxes, the Democrats in the U.S. Senate produced a news release on April 16 that criticized the Republican-backed tax bill that President Donald Trump signed into law late last year. The document began, "As millions of Americans finish preparing their taxes, corporate executives are laughing all the way to the bank thanks to the Republican tax bill," the document said. Executives, the release continued, are "laying off American workers – in fact, more than 100,000 American workers have already been laid off in 2018." This statistic is wrong in two ways. The office of Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., told us the 100,000-person count was based on public reporting of layoffs and was not intended to be comprehensive. However, there is a comprehensive number published every month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In January 2018, there were 1,784,000 layoffs, and in February, there were 1,647,000. That’s more than 3.4 million layoffs in those two months alone — or 34 times the number cited in the Democratic document. "Each quarter, millions of Americans are laid off, millions more quit, and millions are hired," said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com. "Even when the net growth in employment each month is only in the range of 100,000 to 200,000, that's the result of far more hires, quits, and layoffs, as people change jobs or enter and leave employment." Another problem: the implication that the recent tax law has made things worse. In reality, the number of layoffs has varied within a narrow band since the recovery from the Great Recession took hold. According to BLS data, the number of layoffs has bounced around since mid 2010 in a narrow range, between 1.5 million to 1.9 million per month. So there isn’t a significant change in the current pace of layoffs. Here’s a chart showing the number of layoffs in every month since December 2000: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Kolko noted that a better statistic is actually the layoff rate, which is layoffs divided by the total number of people employed. This takes into account the number of employed Americans, which generally rises over time. The chart shows an even stronger pattern: Since the end of the Great Recession, the layoff rate has been declining, under both Trump and his predecessor, President Barack Obama. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "The layoff rate is actually low by historical standards," said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. Kolko added that nearly twice as many workers today are quitting as are getting laid off, "reflecting the confidence many workers have that they'll be able to find another job in today's labor market." The quits-to-layoffs ratio today is near its highest level since 2001, he said. Schumer’s office disputed that they were trying to imply that layoffs had accelerated significantly as a result of the tax bill. Rather, they said the point was that that the bill hasn’t lived up to the rosy promises made by Republicans who supported the tax bill, from Trump to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Even so, the available data only covers the first two months after the tax bill was signed, calling into question how large an impact it could have had on preventing layoffs. Our ruling Schumer and the Senate Democrats said that in the wake of the Republican-backed tax bill, "more than 100,000 American workers have already been laid off in 2018." The number of layoffs in that period was actually 34 times higher than the number cited — and the layoff rate has actually been declining consistently for the past eight years.

pomt-10769	President Clinton "reduced the scale of our military dramatically."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/22/mitt-romney/defense-cuts-had-gop-support-too/	At a Republican debate in Orlando on Oct. 21, 2007, Mitt Romney blamed President Clinton for shrinking the military. "During the Clinton years, the president said we're going to take a peace dividend," Romney said. "We got the dividend. We didn't get the peace. He reduced the scale of our military dramatically, took 500,000 troops out, cut back our Navy by 80 ships." This claim is similar to others made by Romney in campaign speeches that we have previously checked and found were misleading. In April 2007, he said, "Following the end of the Cold War, President Clinton began to dismantle our military. He reduced our forces by 500,000. He retired almost 80 ships. Our spending on national defense dropped from over 6 percent of GDP to 3.8 percent today." He is correct that military forces were reduced significantly under Clinton. The active-duty military totaled 1.8-million at the start of his presidency in 1993 and declined to 1.4-million in 2000. Romney is also correct that the naval fleet shrank dramatically. The Navy had 454 ships in 1993, but as vessels were retired and not replaced, the fleet was down to 341 by 2000. But Romney is selectively choosing numbers that make it appear the military cuts were Clinton's alone. In fact, the cuts were prompted by the end of the Cold War during the presidency of President George H.W. Bush, a Republican. During Bush's presidency, he and Congress agreed to a sharp drop in military personnel. Active-duty military declined from 2.2-million to 1.8-million. Total defense forces also shrank, from 3.3-million to 2.9-million. Also, in his April statement, Romney distorts the economics by pulling an old number from the Reagan years. Military spending hasn't been 6 percent of GDP since 1986. So Romney is comparing a Reagan-era defense spending number with a Clinton number, but his comment suggests the whole decline occurred under Clinton. Contrary to Romney's claim, the post-Cold War shrinkage of the U.S. military was a bipartisan effort. It began under a Republican president and a Democratic Congress and continued under a Democratic president and a Republican Congress. And so we find, as we did before, that Romney's claim is Half True. Share The Facts Mitt Romney Republican presidential candidate "President Clinton "reduced the scale of military dramatically."

pomt-06338	In Georgia, "hard-earned lottery dollars are doled out to the scion[s] of wealthy families."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/09/rainbowpush-coalition/rainbowpush-wealthy-students-get-hope-scholarship/	When Occupy Atlanta took over Woodruff Park and shouted for more economic equality, veteran civil rights activist Joe Beasley did what activists are wont to do. He joined them. The Southern regional director for the civil rights group Rainbow/PUSH Coalition spoke out for social justice. He defended the group when its occupation tried Mayor Kasim Reed’s patience. Reed kicked them out of the park, and Beasley faced arrest alongside them But when Beasley called for Reed’s ouster over his treatment of protesters, Rainbow/PUSH headquarters told him to hush. It’s no time to take on Reed, they said in an Oct. 28 statement. "In a state where both U.S. senators proudly voted against health care reform ... where hard-earned lottery dollars are doled out to the scion[s] of wealthy families, targeting Mayor Reed seems wasteful and naive," Rainbow/PUSH’s statement said. Wait a second, we thought. What’s this about the scions of wealthy families getting lottery dollars? This makes Georgia sound like a bumbling Robin Hood, taking from the poor and giving to the rich. We contacted Rainbow/PUSH for additional information, but it did not respond to our request. It was clear that the group was referring to the HOPE scholarship program, which uses lottery dollars to fund college and technical-school tuition for any student who meets certain academic standards, regardless of income. Lottery funds also support statewide pre-kindergarten programs. At first, the state only gave HOPE scholarships to families that made less than $66,000. Legislators later nixed the limit because they wanted to use it to keep the best-performing students in state, regardless of income. Until recently, HOPE covered 100 percent of tuition at Georgia colleges for high school students graduating with a 3.0 grade-point average. The state Legislature made it tougher to get the scholarship in March after the program ran into budget problems. Now, students with a 3.7 average and a 1200 SAT will get full tuition coverage. Those with lower grades will get less money. Some critics have called the HOPE scholarship welfare for the affluent, claiming that the bulk of the dollars go to students who don’t need financial help. We talked to experts who have studied HOPE and similar broad-based statewide scholarship programs to check the accuracy of Rainbow/PUSH’s claim. We found that while it’s likely that the children of some wealthy families received HOPE scholarship money, reality is not as Rainbow/PUSH described it. Researchers have found it’s reasonable to conclude that middle- and upper-income families reap a greater share of the benefits of HOPE. An investigation and resulting series of articles by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published in 2003 came to a similar conclusion. Other statewide merit scholarship programs have the same problem. "I’d say it’s pretty much settled," said Ross Rubenstein, a Syracuse University professor who has studied HOPE. "Most of the benefits tend to flow to middle- and upper-income families." One reason is research consistently shows that children in higher-earning families tend to achieve more academic success. In addition, scholars have known for years that people with less education and lower income tend to spend a greater share of their money on lottery games. A 2002 study co-authored by Rubenstein estimated that households that made $25,000 or less or between $35,000 and $50,000 each year gave more to lottery funds than they received in college scholarships and other benefits. Research published by the National Tax Journal in 2001 suggests that the program widened the gap in college attendance between students from low- and high-income families. Two University of Georgia professors found that HOPE scholarships are more likely to be awarded to counties with higher per-capita incomes, although lower-income families tend to spend a greater share of their money on the lottery. One peculiar result is that HOPE scholarships may have boosted car sales, according to a study co-authored by University of Georgia professor David Mustard. His research found that county car registrations increased when their number of HOPE recipients attending state-system and private schools rose, so long as the county’s per-capita income was above the 75th percentile. "Do the children of really wealthy families get HOPE? Probably yes," Mustard said. "And really poor families do, too. But wealthy families do get it at higher rates." But what researchers know about HOPE and income has its limits. The scholarship application does not ask students to disclose how much their families make, Mustard said, so scholars are unable to do more precise calculations. It’s likely that children from upper-income families do receive HOPE scholarship money, as Rainbow/PUSH’s news release stated. But the group’s rhetoric is so strident that it confuses the issue. Truth does underlie its statement. Middle- and upper- income families tend to receive more of the scholarship’s benefits, even though lower-income families tend to spend a greater share of their money buying the lottery tickets that fund HOPE. Still, it’s not fair to suggest that the program takes from the poor and gives to the rich, or the "scion[s] of wealthy families," as Rainbow/PUSH said. Middle-income families are among the program’s greatest beneficiaries. Lower-income and poor families do receive a notable share of the scholarships. Rainbow/PUSH is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s our definition for Half True.

pomt-02974	Common Core is being "used by the Obama Administration to turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a national school board."	false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/22/marco-rubio/common-core-obama-administration-national-school-b/	The Common Core education standards were the topic of contentious public meetings in Florida this month. Now they’re coming between two of Florida’s top Republicans -- U.S. Sen Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush. Bush appeared on ABC’s Sunday morning news show This Week to discuss his Foundation for Excellence in Education, which was hosting a conference in Boston. During the interview, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl noted that a lot of conservatives are suspicious of Common Core. "I mean Marco Rubio said not long ago, it’s (Common Core) increasingly being used by the Obama administration to turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a National School Board." Bush responded: "Based on the facts as I know them, that’s not accurate. Marco's concerned about a national curriculum, and I am as well. There's a big fear on the right about this massive government overreach. I totally appreciate that. But that’s not what this is. This is a national imperative. It’s not a federal government program." We couldn’t resist fact-checking a disagreement on the facts between Rubio and Bush, both of whom are considered possible presidential candidates for 2016. We tracked down Rubio’s original comments to a statement he gave to the Tampa Bay Times on July 26: "Common Core started out as a well-intentioned effort to develop more rigorous curriculum standards. However, it is increasingly being used by the Obama administration to turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a national school board. This effort to coerce states into adhering to national curriculum standards is not the best way to help our children attain the best education. Empowering parents, local communities and the individual states is the best approach." (That statement to the Times followed an interview that Rubio had given to the conservative Shark Tank blog the day before.) We decided to check whether the Obama administration has used Common Core to "turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a national school board." Common Core is about standards Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states, including Florida. They came out of years of discussion between private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The Obama administration has used its education grant process, Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Rubio said that the Obama administration would turn the Education Department into "what is effectively a national school board." His office didn't answer our questions about what he meant by his comments. We should note that school boards have a variety of duties, including setting budgets and dealing with school finances. But Rubio specifically mentioned curriculum, which means selecting what students study. So we'll focus our fac-tchecking on questions of curriculum. We looked into the claim that Common Core "nationalizes" curriculum in 2012. Back then, five education experts told us they disagreed that Common Core standards nationalize curriculum. Experts told us that setting standards -- such as understanding decimals or reading comprehension -- isn’t the same as telling educators what curriculum to use to teach those standards. "It describes a destination -- again, voluntary for states -- not the means of getting there," Chester Finn, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Education in the 1980s who is president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which works to reform education. "Yes, if a bunch of states faithfully implement it (45 have signed up but many won't seriously implement them), it will bring greater commonality to what is taught across the country in those two subjects. In my view that's a good thing. Why should 5th graders in Portland, Maine, and Portland, Ore., be learning different math?" We ran Rubio’s comments by the state Department of Education and other education experts. They told us that under Common Core, the federal government has not supplanted the role of state and local officials to make curriculum decisions. While Common Core are standards, the decisions about what books teachers should use to meet the standards are decisions made at the state and local level. In fact, federal law predating Common Core prohibits "an officer or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control a State, local educational agency, or school’s curriculum..." The law bans the federal use of funds to "endorse, approve, or sanction any curriculum designed to be used in an elementary school or secondary school." At the local level, the authority to set school curriculum doesn’t necessarily lie with the school board. For example, in Hillsborough County, committees of content specialists -- many of them teachers -- review the state approved list of textbooks and narrow it down to three finalists. Then, teachers in that specialty area vote on a final pick, and the school board votes on approving the money to buy that textbook. A spokesman for Pasco County schools told us emphatically that Common Core doesn’t create anything like a national school board. "To suggest that the Obama administration is meddling in state and district curriculum decisions is not supported by the facts," Linda Cobbe, spokeswoman for Pasco schools told PolitiFact. "First of all, who in state leadership would allow that to happen in Florida? Second, the Pasco district is writing our own curriculum and selecting our own textbooks to meet the Common Core standards, and neither the president nor Arnie Duncan has had any input." We also found similar explanations in a presentation developed by the Florida Department of Education and Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s staff. It states: "Standards are not curriculum. The standards describe ‘the what’ that students need to learn; however, they do not spell out ‘the how’ for teachers. Curriculum and instruction define ‘the how.’ ‘The how’ is determined at the local levels; the district, the school and the classroom." This means that districts across Florida -- and the nation -- could make different curriculum decisions to achieve the same standards. We found several examples nationwide of local school districts of setting their own curriculum in response to Common Core. (And there are even Common Core consultants that districts can hire.) Some English teachers in Miami-Dade County are already making changes to their reading lists, according to an article by the Hechinger Report, a news outlet affiliated with Teachers College at Columbia University. A teacher at Coral Reef Senior High moved some novels including To Kill a Mockingbird and The Great Gatsby off the syllabus and replaced them with nonfiction texts, short stories and plays. The new standards call for more challenging reading, so the teacher added Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night and Cyrano de Bergerac. In Wisconsin, the Germantown school district is planning its science curriculum around Common Core and might offer biology to students earlier in high school than in the past and blend various strands of science for a more rigorous curriculum, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote. In Oregon, the Tigard-Tualatin School District has added more nonfiction reading to its curriculum. "As an adult you spend most of your time engaged in informational text," said Sue Scott, Tigard-Tualatin’s associate director of curriculum and instruction. The Oregonian reported: "Take dinosaurs — an instructional text could be an encyclopedia-like entry about pterodactyls, a chart categorizing different species as herbivores, carnivores and omnivore or notes from a fossil dig." The Louisiana Department of Education has provided teachers with some sample Common Core lesson plans, but no specific curriculum. "The flexibility is meant to empower school districts and teachers to make up their own lesson plans..." the Times-Picayune reported. Our ruling Rubio said that Common Core is being "used by the Obama Administration to turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a national school board." That makes it sound like the federal government is telling local school districts what to teach under Common Core. Our reporting showed that’s not the case. Decisions about curriculum lie where they did before Common Core: with state and local education officials. The U.S. Education Department has been given no new power by Obama -- or anyone else -- to act like a school board and dictate which math or reading books are used at schools across the country. We rate this claim False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2013-10-22T13:26:35	2013-07-26	['None']
pomt-12868	"From the release of a child rapist from the Dominican Republican to that of an Italian drug smuggler, Philadelphians have already been put in direct danger by Mayor Kenney’s policy of blocking local law enforcement from participating with federal immigration authorities."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jan/31/joe-defelice/phillys-sanctuary-city-status-putting-residents-da/	Has Philly released dangerous undocumented criminals in recent years? Conservatives continue to point to examples. "From the release of a child rapist from the Dominican Republican (sic) to that of an Italian drug smuggler," Philly GOP chair Joe DeFelice said in an emailed statement last Wednesday, "Philadelphians have already been put in direct danger by Mayor Kenney’s policy of blocking local law enforcement from participating with federal immigration authorities." According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, there indeed has been an alleged child rapist of Dominican origin, and an Italian man who pleaded guilty to possession of and intent to deliver illicit drugs. One by one: Winston Enrique Perez Pilarte, who was charged in Philadelphia under the name Josue Duran-Cortes with various child sexual assault charges, was released after posting $25,000 bail two months before Kenney entered office. Fabio Dalloco, after authorities say they busted him with 14 pounds of cocaine at the airport, was incarcerated for roughly 14 months and released on time served through his plea deal in August 2016. ICE said that detainer requests were sent but not honored for either of these men, and that the agency rearrested both themselves. Of note: While Dalloco was released during Kenney’s time as mayor, Perez Pilarte was not — he was released during Mayor Michael Nutter’s tenure. Philadelphia first became a sanctuary city in 2014. Nutter signed an executive order that barred Philadelphia Police and Prisons from honoring ICE detainer requests, unless they came with a judicial warrant for a first- or second-degree felon convicted of a violent crime. He rescinded the order during his last two weeks in office. Kenney swiftly reinstated Philly’s "sanctuary status" on the day of his inauguration. We put "sanctuary status" in quotes because what makes a city a sanctuary is heavily debated. Kenney himself uses the term Fourth Amendment city; many legal experts argue that local authorities holding an undocumented resident without civil charges is unreasonable search and seizure, and therefore a violation of constitutional rights. But cooperation with federal immigration authorities is a common test for deciding whether a jurisdiction or, more recently, campus is a "sanctuary." ICE declined to comment on Philadelphia’s current or pre-existing policies. Lauren Hitt, spokeswoman for Mayor Kenney, reacted to DeFelice’s statement in an email. "Republicans point to these inflammatory anecdotes in order to justify defunding cities whose only crime is refusing to enact policies that the courts have found to be unconstitutional," she wrote. "The reality is that numerous research studies show that the City's immigration policy makes Philadelphians safer. Philadelphia's crime rate is at a 40-year-low at the same time our immigrant growth is on the rise. This drop in crime is due in no small part to the fact that our immigration policy has strengthened trust between communities and police." The notion that sanctuary policies are safer is supported in research. According to a Center for American Progress report published late last week, sanctuary counties have lower crime rates. As we explained in an earlier report, looking at sanctuary policies alone wouldn’t account for other factors that could be influencing crime rates, but the CAP’s report compared nearly 2,500 counties, based on ICE’s designations. Another 2016 study, led by researchers out of the University of California Riverside and Highline College, found that sanctuary designations have "no statistically meaningful effect[s] on crime." The majority of local police departments, according the 2009 report "Immigration and Local Policing: Results from a National Survey of Law Enforcement Executives," do not routinely check immigration status. "The great majority of chiefs (72 percent) regard immigration enforcement as the responsibility of federal government," the report reads. "In general, the more serious the violation, the more likely they believe that their officers are to check immigration status." In addition to this, many reports show that there is a concern among local police that seeking out residents for their status could damage trust in immigrant neighborhoods, and therefore make them tougher to police and lower the likelihood of immigrants sharing information when they witness crime. (For more information on this, see PolitiFact Pennsylvania’s sanctuary explainer.) Our ruling Philly GOP Chair Joe DeFelice said in a statement, "From the release of a child rapist from the Dominican Republican (sic) to that of an Italian drug smuggler, Philadelphians have already been put in direct danger by Mayor Kenney’s policy of blocking local law enforcement from participating with federal immigration authorities." Of the two examples given, one man who DeFelice is referring was released before Kenney’s time. Plus, whether the release of these men poses a "direct danger" raises questions. Recent data analysis shows that sanctuary counties are not more dangerous. Can we extrapolate that Dalloco returned to drug smuggling? According to court records, Dalloco wasn’t charged with any crimes in Philadelphia before ICE rearrested him in August 2016, which was two months after his release. ICE confirmed that Dalloco was deported that September. DeFelice’s statement is presumptive. We rule this claim Mostly False.

pomt-02016	"Graduation and third-grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/08/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-graduation-rates-and-t/	Gov. Scott Walker responds to critics of his cuts to education funding by pointing out signs of progress in the state’s elementary and high schools. State residents look at results, Walker says. "For all the hype and hysteria about education, they look at the fact that graduation and third-grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office," he told WISN-AM (1130) talk host Jay Weber on April 16, 2014. "ACT scores continue to be some of the best in the country." Wisconsin students’ longstanding high-achievement scores on the ACT college-readiness exams (second nationally) are well known. But we were interested in what has been happening on the other two measures the governor cited. When asked for backup, Walker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marré said state Department of Public Instruction data proves the governor’s case. And we found it’s the best source of data in both areas. Finishing high school Wisconsin’s statewide public school graduation rate was 85.7 percent in the last full school year (2009-’10) before Walker’s term started in January 2010, according to the data. The figure counts those who graduate within four years of starting. In 2010-’11, the rate rose to 87 percent. This school year began months before Walker took office, so any policy changes would have had negligible effect on graduation rates. The results since then: 2011-’12: 87.5 percent 2012-’13: 88 percent That 88 percent rate was tied for second-best in the country along with Nebraska, Texas and Vermont. Iowa topped the list at 89 percent, DPI reported. At the time Walker spoke on WISN, that 88 percent figure for 2012-’13 was not yet public. Also, we should note that pre-2009 data that is comparable is not available. The new data tracks individual students, while the old method used a different methodology. Under any of the scenarios, the arrow is pointing up, though not emphatically. Reading Scores Third-grade readers, the group cited by Walker, are the youngest public-school students to take the annual Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examinations. State officials typically measure progress, or lack thereof, on reading by calculating the number of students deemed "proficient" or "advanced" based on the exams. The recent history of that figure for third-graders follows a pattern of one-year improvement followed by one-year decline. 2005-06: 32.8 percent proficient or advanced 2006-’07: 34.4 percent 2007-’08: 33.9 percent 2008-’09: 35.2 percent 2009-’10: 32.7 percent (last full school year before Walker’s election) 2010-’11: 34.2 percent 2011-’12: 33.1 percent 2012-’13: 34.9 percent 2013-’14: 34.6 percent So the figure has ping-ponged between about 33 percent and 35 percent. The current figure is higher than most going back nearly a decade, but lower than two of the years. It hasn’t been a straight line upward in Walker’s time, the figures show. Still, the latest year’s count is "up" compared to the baseline year pre-Walker. It’s up just slightly compared with 2010-’11, and more significantly compared with 2009-’10, depending on which is used as the baseline for Walker’s term. Public schools, of course, are not the only ones receiving state education aid. Under the voucher or "choice" program, private schools in certain districts, most notably Milwaukee, benefit from publicly funded vouchers. We concentrated in this item on public schools because Walker’s comments were in the context of responding to criticism of his public-school funding moves. But for the record, third-grade reading scores also have improved in the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program since 2010. Did the governor cherry-pick third-graders because they did better? Not really. Reading scores were up as a whole for students in grades 3-8 and grade 10 who take the test. Walker has made third-grade learning a focal point of his educational platform, and DPI official John Johnson told us that "third-grade reading and eighth-grade mathematics assessments are often pointed to as predictors of future academic success or struggles." Finally, there’s the issue of credit. Walker doesn’t directly credit his own policies as responsible for the positive trends. He cited the numbers as part of litany of positive things around the state while discussing voter attitudes. But implicit in Walker’s statement is some degree of chest-thumping, of course. He’s a candidate seeking re-election, after all. He and his critics no doubt would disagree on his impact on these statistics. But it’s clear that longer-term trends are at play here on the shorter time frame Walker cites. Our rating Walker said, "Graduation and third grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office." The numbers, in both cases, are up compared with the year before he took office, though the reading scores bounced around some. Some credit may be due prior elected officials, though, because the trend lines haven’t really changed much going back deeper into the pre-Walker era. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-08948	"Since 1904, the Ohio victor has won the presidency 25 out of 27 times "	true	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/23/john-kasich/ohios-voter-opinions-steady-bellwether-presidentia/	Republican challenger John Kasich warns that if Democrat Ted Strickland is re-elected governor it could pave the way for Barack Obama to take Ohio in 2012. And given Ohio's track record for predicting the presidency, that could guarantee Obama's re-election, he says. "Since 1904, the Ohio victor has won the presidency 25 out of 27 times," Kasich says on his website. Kasich is correct that Ohio has picked the winner in all but two elections since 1904. Voters backed Republican New York Gov. Thomas Dewey (and his running mate, Ohio Gov. John Bricker) over Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. In 1960, voters favored Republican Vice President Richard Nixon over Sen. John F. Kennedy. We wanted to see just how much of a difference Ohio's vote has made over time, and if the gubernatorial elections signal anything about subsequent presidental votes. Since 1904, when the state backed Theodore Roosevelt, few presidental elections have been so close that Ohio's vote could have swung the result. Ohioans backed Woodrow Wilson's re-election in 1916, a close race in which any of 10 states could have flipped the result. And Ohio could have made a difference in either 2000 and 2004 when it backed George W. Bush, first over Vice President Al Gore and then over Sen. John Kerry. But those are the only three elections in which a change in Ohio's result would have swung enough electoral votes to change the presidency. Will the outcome of this year's gubernatorial election affect how Ohio votes in 2012, as Kasich contends? History doesn't appear to be on his side. There have been 13 gubernatorial elections since Ohio changed the governor's term to four years. Democrat Michael DiSalle won the first, in 1958, two years before Kennedy's victory. But Ohio didn't back Kennedy. Seven other times since, Ohio's pick for governor didn't match its party choice for president two years later. The state has matched, though, on the last three, backing Republican Bob Taft II and then supporting Bush and backing Strickland before voting with Obama. The answer to the state's accuracy as a presidential bellwether may lie in its population. "The state itself represents very well the political diversity of the country," Eric Rademacher, co-director of the University of Cincinnati's Institute for Policy Research, once told The Plain Dealer. The institute sponsors The Ohio Poll. So while Ohio can't say it's the decider (Bush already claimed that title), it can boast that it's the presidential predictor -- a claim supported by 25 of 27 correct votes, including 12 in a row. We rate this statement True. Comment on this item.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2010-07-23T10:30:00	2010-06-21	['Ohio']

pomt-08821	Kathryn Starkey "joined forces with liberal Democrats on a historic sales tax hike."	false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/13/committee-protect-florida/taxin-kathryn-starkey-draws-fire-over-2004-local-s/	A new political mailer from the Committee to Protect Florida attacks State House District 45 candidate Kathryn Starkey of New Port Richey for her record on taxes, citing her role on a water district board and her support of the Penny for Pasco, a 2004 increase in the county sales tax. The committee is headed up by Rockie Pennington, a political consultant for Richard Corcoran, one of Starkey’s two opponents in the Aug. 24 Republican primary. (Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.) "Taxin’ Kathryn," says the mailer sent in early August 2010. "With Kathryn Starkey’s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?" We wondered, can you trust the mailer’s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item examines her actions and stance on the Penny for Pasco sales tax. Other items are here on her attendance at river board meetings and here on her actions involving votes on river board tax rates. The tax hike in question is the Penny for Pasco sales tax, a one-cent-on-the-dollar county sales tax increase to build new schools and roads, preserve land and buy public safety equipment. About 52 percent of voters approved the tax in March 2004. By the end of 2009, the extra penny had pulled in about $205 million. The claim that Starkey "joined forces with liberal Democrats" to pass the tax has problems. First, Starkey played no strong public role in selling the tax to voters. She publicly endorsed the Penny for Pasco during her successful 2004 campaign for School Board, but she never actively campaigned for it or joined the committee promoting it. Second, where were the liberal Democrats? Pasco’s Citizen Committee, the political action committee that formed to promote the tax, had 14 key volunteers: 10 of them were registered Republicans, the Pasco Times reported then. They included well-known Republicans Allen Altman, Joanne Hurley, Thad Lowery and Bill Phillips. True, the tax got the endorsement of Pasco’s Democratic Executive Committee and not that of the county’s Republican Executive Committee. But consider, too, the prominent Republican politicians who publicly supported the tax: Commissioners Ted Schrader, Ann Hildebrand and Pat Mulieri and then-commissioner Steve Simon, along with then-state representatives Ken Littlefield and Heather Fiorentino. And don’t forget Pasco Sheriff Bob White, another Republican, who was quoted in the Pasco Times calling support of the tax a "no-brainer." White said then that his remarks were aimed primarily at how the tax would help the school district, but his endorsement — however nuanced — was political gold for the tax’s backers. One big selling point for Republicans: The sales tax would result in a property tax reduction on the school district side. (Incidentally, that is not unlike Corcoran’s platform in the House 45 campaign to eliminate property taxes and increase the sales tax.) To be sure, there were Democrats who were very involved in the effort. They included Land O’Lakes lawyer Tim Hayes and, most visibly, Ray Gadd, who led the school system’s effort as a Pasco school district administrator at the time. Then-commissioner Peter Altman, a Democrat, was also a vocal supporter. "I can’t think of a liberal Democrat who was involved," said Gadd, who, incidentally, has changed his affiliation to independent. The strongest opponents of the tax included Republicans Bill and Ann Bunting, leaders in the local party. But even they acknowledge that they were more often fighting people with Rs, not Ds, after their names. "I can’t for the life of me understand how those Republicans supported it," said Ann Bunting. Pennington, Corcoran’s consultant, said he linked Starkey with the Penny leaders because her endorsement as a School Board candidate carried weight. He said he also thought Allen Altman, who helped spearhead the campaign, was a Democrat. (Wrong.) Corcoran was equally mistaken that the tax was a strongly Democratic initiative. "It was overwhelmingly pushed by Democratic leaders," he said. (He was also unaware that White — whom he now works for as a contract attorney — endorsed the Penny.) A new tax may be often associated with "liberal Democrats," but that wasn’t the case with Penny for Pasco, particularly when it came to those who were publicly pushing for it. In addition, Starkey was not a key promoter of the tax. We rate this claim False.	None	Committee to Protect Florida	None	None	None	2010-08-13T19:18:47	2010-08-02	['None']
pomt-00026	"Money raised to help (Beto) O’Rourke get elected is being used to fund migrants. This is clearly breaking campaign finance laws."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/did-beto-orourke-really-use-campaign-funds-help-mi/	Sen. Ted Cruz is in a closer-than-comfortable race with U.S. Rep Beto O’Rourke, and trying to draw a connection between the El Paso Democrat and the migrant caravan. He’s helped by recent reports that he’s caught in a "caravan scandal," as one headline describes allegations that O’Rourke is illegally using campaign resources to help Honduran migrants. "Mr. Open Borders O’Rourke—who has called for amnesty—has staffers giving aid to the caravan coming for our border," reads a story posted on Patriot Journal on Nov. 2. "Money raised to help O’Rourke get elected is being used to fund migrants. This is clearly breaking campaign finance laws." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) CrowdTangle data shows it had been shared on Facebook more than 16,000 times as of Election Day. The Patriot Journal doesn’t have contact information on its website, and the publication did not immediately respond to a Facebook message seeking more information about its story. However, its claim seems to stem from a video posted to YouTube on Nov. 1 by Project Veritas, an organization that creates undercover sting videos of its targets, including media organizations. (Patriot Journal embedded the video in its story.) The approximately 24-minute video is titled: "Nobody needs to know: Beto campaign appears to illegally spend funds on supplies for caravan aliens," and it shows clips of campaign staffers talking about buying food and giving rides to immigrants. "For me, I can ignore the rules," a field manager says near the beginning. "I don’t mind breaking the rules and I can defend any position." "Don’t ever repeat this and stuff but, like, if we just say that we’re buying food for a campaign event, like the Halloween events, cause there’s block walks coming up for Halloween," a field organizer is recorded saying a few moments later. When the undercover Project Veritas staffer says, "I know that we’re using some of the campaign resources to help with the migrants and like I just didn’t want anybody to get in trouble with that, like I didn’t want them to ask me any questions about people using resources," O’Rourke’s campaign manager says, "Don’t worry." James O’Keefe, the conservative activist behind Project Veritas, is then shown in El Paso explaining to viewers what he says the videos mean. "The videos that you’re about to see appear to show Beto’s campaign workers and his staff all the way up to his campaign manager, Jody Casey, knowingly using campaign resources and funds to help assist, subsidize illegal aliens entering the United States, some of them from the migrant caravan," O’Keefe says. A later clip of the field manager shows him talking to another staffer about "that migrant caravan." "A few of them got here already and they’re dropping them off like really close to Missouri," he says. (Missouri is the name of a street in El Paso.) The staffer then says the migrants are "the Hondurans." In response to an email seeking more information about the allegations, O’Rourke’s campaign forwarded this statement from Nov. 2: "Ted Cruz shamefully and falsely suggested that the Beto for Texas campaign used campaign dollars to fund a caravan that remains hundreds of miles from the U.S.-Mexico border." The campaign also pointed PolitiFact to two news stories in the Texas Tribune and the El Paso Times. The Tribune story, posted online Nov. 2, reports that the campaign said staffers recently "took it upon themselves" to use campaign funds to donate supplies to an El Paso nonprofit. The campaign said the contributions, totaling less than $300, will be "appropriately reported" to the Federal Election Commission, according to the story. O’Rourke’s campaign said the staffers were responding to an unrelated situation in which the federal government dropped off more than 100 migrants seeking asylum at a bus station in downtown El Paso, the Tribune reports. The El Paso Times reported on Nov. 2 that Chris Evans, a spokesman for the campaign, said staffers used prepaid credit cards to buy "wipes, diapers, water, fruit and granola bars" and donated them to Annunciation House, a nonprofit that provides support to immigrants. But it’s not illegal to donate campaign funds to a nonprofit as long as the parties abide by this rule: The organization can’t compensate the candidate—if it’s going to at all—before using or spending the entire donation, according to FEC. In other words, the donation can’t personally benefit the candidate. The Tribune also talked to a campaign finance expert, Paul S. Ryan with the government watchdog group Common Cause. He told the publication that unless the donations are improperly reported to the FEC, they don’t break any laws. So here’s what we know: Though in the video a campaign staffer talks about helping Honduran immigrants, describing them as members of the migrant caravan who recently arrived in El Paso, the caravan was still hundreds of miles away as of Nov. 5. The campaign says that staffers did use funds to help migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The Annunciation House, where the campaign said the goods were donated, has been assisting families released from federal detention centers following background checks and fingerprinting, according to the El Paso Times. Still, though the "staffers are shown expressing awareness that what they are doing is improper, or at least could be perceived as improper," the Tribune reports, the campaign doesn’t appear to be breaking the law unless it fails to properly report its donations to the FEC.

pomt-14850	"When I became governor, I inherited a large deficit. You know what? We just turned that into the largest surplus in Virginia history."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/nov/16/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-he-inherited-large-defict-and-turne/	It’s a rags-to-riches story that Gov. Terry McAuliffe loves to tell. "When I became governor, I inherited a large deficit," McAuliffe, a Democrat, said during a Nov. 2 interview on MSNBC’s "Hardball With Chris Matthews." "You know what? We just turned that into the largest surplus in Virginia history." He made similar statements during Aug. 26 and Oct. 28 interviews on WTOP radio in Washington and in a July 9 speech to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. And during a July 21 interview on WRVA radio in Richmond, McAuliffe added some details. "I did announce a nice surplus the other day - $553 million," the governor said. "I remind you, when I became governor I inherited a $2.4 billion deficit. It wasn’t my budget, I wasn’t even governor yet, and we worked in a bipartisan way to work that out." We decided to fact-check McAuliffe’s claim, wondering how he could have inherited a deficit from his predecessor, Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, when the state constitution requires a balanced budget. We examined the two elements in the governor’s full statement: 1) that he inherited a deficit and, 2) that it was turned into a record surplus. The inheritance Virginia has a two-year budget cycle. Prior to the start of the first year, the legislature approves and the governor signs a biennial plan. After that, the governor and lawmakers negotiate budget amendments based on the needs and finances at the time. The state constitution requires that total expenditures not exceed revenues at the end of the two-year period. McDonnell, in one of his last acts as governor, presented two budget bills to the General Assembly on Dec. 16, 2013. The first bill put his finishing touches on the outgoing two-year budget, set to expire June 30, 2014. The proposal, called the "caboose budget," anticipated $35.4 billion in general fund revenues for the budget cycle and $34.9 billion in expenses. The second bill was McDonnell’s proposal for the coming two-year budget, which began July 1, 2014. He anticipated almost $37.8 billion in general revenues and proposed $37.7 billion in spending. In other words, when McAuliffe took office on Jan. 11, 2014, McDonnell left two balanced budget bills sitting on his desk. So why does McAuliffe say he "inherited a large deficit?" Brian Coy, a McAuliffe spokesman, noted that the state’s economy slowed that winter and spring, causing tax revenues to fall below expectation. The McDonnell administration "left behind a budget that had a forecast that was too optimistic for our financial situation," he told us. "They supported a spending threshold that was too high." Does that mean McDonnell should have seen the economic slowdown coming? "With the benefit of hindsight, some signs could have been detectable and some may have not," Coy said. The slowdown was caused by two factors: •Tax cuts ushered in by former President George W. Bush expired in 2013 and the capital gains tax rose. As a result, there was a surge of people cashing in capital assets before the new rates took effect, followed by a lull after the levy went up. The lull caused a steep decline in non-withholding tax receipts in Virginia in 2014. •Federal spending cuts hurt Northern Virginia, the state’s largest economic engine. McAuliffe sensed the problems shortly after taking office, but he underestimated their severity. On Feb. 12, 2014, he reduced the revenue estimate in the coming two-year budget McDonnell proposed by $140 million. "Although our underlying economic forecast has not changed," McAuliffe said, "it is clear that the current revenue receipts warrant attention." In May, the shortfall exploded to an estimated $1.5 billion. The General Assembly and McAuliffe that month agreed to a new two-year budget going into effect July 1 and patched the revenue hole by making about $800 million in spending cuts and drawing $700 million from the state’s rainy day fund. Seven months into his term, on Aug.15, 2014, McAuliffe estimated the shortfall at $2.4 billion and ordered additional cuts to keep the new two-year budget balanced. In a speech to the General Assembly’s money committees, the governor said that out of caution, his forecast was deliberately "pessimistic." The surplus The second part of McAuliffe’s statement is that the shortfall was "turned" into the "largest surplus in Virginia history." That stems from McAuliffe’s announcement in July 2015 that Virginia ended the first year of its biennial budget $550 million in the black. The figure slightly outstrips the previous surplus high of $545 million for the budget year that ended in mid-2005, according to records going back to 1990. But it should be noted that when adjusted for inflation, the 2005 surplus still is the highest. Some people hearing McAuliffe’s statement might conclude that Virginia’s budget has made almost a $3 billion rebound during the last year - from a $2.4 billion shortfall in 2014 to a $550 million surplus this year. That’s not the case. McAuliffe and the legislature overestimated the state’s economic problems in August 2014 when they adjusted the two-year budget to a "pessimistic" forecast of a $2.4 billion shortfall. That assumption turned out to be $550 million too high and produced the record surplus McAuliffe cites. Our ruling McAuliffe said, "When I became governor, I inherited a large deficit. … We just turned that into the largest surplus in Virginia history." The simple fact is that McAuliffe inherited balanced budget proposals from McDonnell. Perhaps, as the governor’s spokesman suggests, McDonnell should have seen approaching clouds and proposed a more conservative spending plan. But that’s hindsight and financial projections are tricky. When McAuliffe sensed an economic slowdown during his first weeks in office, he made a modest $140 million cut to McDonnell’s revenue forecast. Six months later, McAuliffe was projecting a $2.4 billion shortfall. McAuliffe is hardly the first governor to accuse his predecessor of leaving behind a financial mess. But evidence shows the brunt of the economic slowdown, though not McAuliffe’s fault, occurred during his watch. This year’s $550 million surplus is a state record in terms of raw dollars, although not in inflation-adjusted dollars. But the surplus does not mean there’s been a record turnaround in Virginia’s economy. It means that the revenue shortfall is turning out not to be as steep as projected in 2014. On the whole, we rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly False.	None	Terry McAuliffe	None	None	None	2015-11-16T00:00:00	2015-11-02	['Virginia']
pomt-10299	"McCain opposed a requirement that the government buy American-made motorcycles. And he said all buy-American provisions were quote 'disgraceful.' "	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/12/barack-obama/mccain-opposed-buy-american-rules/	In a radio ad airing in the heart of Harley-Davidson country, Sen. Barack Obama accuses Sen. John McCain of turning his back on American-made products. An announcer introduces McCain telling motorcycle enthusiasts in South Dakota that he prefers the roar of Harley-Davidsons to the cheers that Obama received during a recent trip to Germany. "Not long ago, a couple hundred thousand Berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent. I'll take the roar of 50,000 Harleys any day," McCain said. The announcer then states: "But when it comes to his record, American-made motorcycles like Harleys don't matter to John McCain. Back in Washington, McCain opposed a requirement that the government buy American-made motorcycles. And he said all buy-American provisions were quote 'disgraceful.' Surprised? You shouldn't be. This is the same John McCain who supported billions in tax breaks for companies who ship American jobs overseas. It's time to hear the roar of a strong American economy again, and stop John McCain from shipping our jobs overseas." Obama's campaign is broadcasting the 60-second ad in York, Pa., in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, and in Wisconsin, where Harley-Davidson is headquartered. York is home to Harley's largest motorcycle manufacturing plant and played host to McCain the day the ad debuted. In this item, we'll focus on whether McCain called a requirement for the federal government to buy American products "disgraceful." Indeed he did. McCain has repeatedly voted and spoken against requiring the government to buy American-made products. He argues that such a requirement hurts trade and doesn't guarantee the lowest prices for taxpayers. In a 1997 article in Defense Daily, McCain criticized the requirement as "the worst, most disgraceful aspect of the legislative process in Washington. I can not be more strong in my views without using four letter words. It's crazy for us, because ball bearings are made in a certain state, to somehow prevent the United States Defense Department from purchasing ball bearings if they meet quality standards from our allies." In 2005, he specifically mentioned motorcycles during Senate debate on a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security. "Lastly, I am also disappointed that the bill once again this year contains a department-wide 'buy America' requirement, and specific language directing the Secret Service to purchase American-made motorcycles. I firmly object to all 'buy America' restrictions, as they represent gross examples of protectionist trade policy." He added, "Furthermore, as a fiscal conservative, I want to ensure our government gets the best deal for taxpayers and with a 'buy American' restriction that cannot be guaranteed." The McCain campaign did not respond to Obama's charge. But his past words say it all. Obama's claim is True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-12T00:00:00	2008-08-12	['None']

pomt-09735	"The first installment of health care reform ... will raise the deficit by $250 billion."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/20/john-cornyn/sen-cornyn-says-first-installment-democrats-health/	If you heard Sen. John Cornyn's comments on CBS's Face the Nation on Oct. 18, 2009, you may have thought the Democrats' big health care reform plan was coming to the Senate floor this week and that it would explode the federal deficit. "In fact, this week, Majority Leader Harry Reid has scheduled to vote on the first installment of health care reform, which will violate the president’s promise not to raise the deficit by one dime," Cornyn said. "In fact, it will raise the deficit by $250 billion." The very same day, White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel said on CNN's State of the Union that the president's health care plan is "more than deficit neutral." So what gives? Emanuel is correct that the Congressional Budget Office looked at the version of the health care bill authored by Sen. Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who chairs the Finance Committee, and concluded that the bill would cost $829 billion over 10 years, but that offsetting funding for it would actually reduce the federal deficit by $81 billion. But Cornyn's not talking about that plan. He's talking about an issue that has been largely absent from the health care debate: a proposal to fundamentally change the way doctors are paid by Medicare. Here's the backstory. For more than a decade, Medicare payments to physicians have been limited by a cost-containment formula called the Sustainable Growth Rate, which is tied to the growth rate of the economy (but not to health care costs, which have been growing faster). The problem is, it would require such deep cuts to doctors' pay that Congress has stepped in to make temporary fixes. Baucus' health plan proposes another Band-Aid through 2010, but a more permanent solution is now being discussed. This week, the Senate may vote on a plan to permanently fix the payment formula. Democrats and Republicans alike are in agreement that the current formula is unrealistic. The Democrats have proposed a fix that comes with a 10-year, $245 billion price tag. Democrats so far haven't proposed any way to pay for that, hence Cornyn's comment that it would add $250 billion to the federal deficit. And to the extent that paying Medicare doctors ought to be a part of any overall health care plan, he argues, this is the "first installment" of the Democrats' health care reform. Democrats, meanwhile, argue this is a separate issue from the current health care debate. They argue this was a broken formula that needed to be fixed no matter whether they tackled health care reform or not. So they made it a separate bill. Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, has mixed feelings about handling the physician pay issue separately from the health care reform bill. To leave the $245 billion physician pay issue "lurking around the corner is to ignore the facts," said Wilensky, now an economist and senior fellow with Project Hope, a health care advocacy group. Congress has been patching the issue for years, digging the problem in deeper and deeper. It might be disingenuous for the Republicans to cite it as proof that the Democrats' health care plan would explode the deficit, Wilensky said. But it's also disingenuous for President Barack Obama and other Democrats to claim a deficit-neutral health care plan without mentioning this huge expense coming around the corner. To a large extent, she said, the health care debate has "morphed into health insurance reform." That's important, but just one of several major health care issues, such as the way the government pays doctors for Medicare. "There's no question there is a significant budget issue," Wilensky said. "They have been patching since 2002. What they need is a fundamental redo of how we pay physicians." Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, said Democrats are at least stepping up to address a long-standing problem, one that has been pushed along by Republicans and Democrats alike. Since both sides agree the funding formula should be changed, he said, "Separating it is a reasonable way to do it." Cornyn is right that the Medicare plan would cost nearly $250 billion and that it would add to the deficit because Democrats have not found money to offset it. And we believe he has the license for a little hyperbole that allows him to characterize it as "the first installment" of health care reform. However, it's not the health care reform package that has been under such heated discussion for the past few months and he misleads people by suggesting that it is — and that the reform package would add $250 billion to the deficit. So we find his claim Half True.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2009-10-20T13:44:03	2009-10-18	['None']
pomt-13476	Says "Patrick Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/sep/09/american-future-fund/ad-attacking-patrick-murphy-among-least-effective-/	A conservative organization portrays U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, as a "fabulously phony failure" in a TV ad. Murphy is taking on Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio in one of the most closely watched Senate battles in the nation. In the ad, American Future Fund says, "Patrick Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen." The fund is a political nonprofit organization that does not have to disclose its donors and has spent millions of dollars this election cycle largely attacking Democrats. We will explain the basis of that claim and the shortcomings of the evidence. (The ad also states that Murphy distorted his work record related to being a certified public accountant and small business owner. We have fact-checked similar attacks about his resume .) ‘Faulty analysis’ The ad cites an InsideGov ranking of members of Congress, as well as a Tampa Bay Times blog about the ranking. InsideGov is a product of Graphiq, a technology company that amasses data. We have previously dissected that ranking in a misleading attack by Murphy’s primary opponent, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson of Orlando. Murphy was first elected in 2012. The InsideGov ranking was published in August 2015, and only deals with Murphy’s tenure through 2014. That was when Murphy was a Democratic freshman with little seniority in the Republican-controlled Congress. The tally does not include bills introduced in the current 114th Congress (Jan. 3, 2015-Jan. 3, 2017) since they still have time to pass bills. InsideGov ranked Murphy as the 21st least-effective member. The list is stacked with rookies — 21 of the politicians named "least effective" have served four years or less. It’s also overwhelmingly filled with Democrats, the minority party in the House since 2011. The main problem with this ranking is it’s based on a single measure: the percentage of bills sponsored by each member over their time in office that went on to pass committee. That’s not a sufficient way to rate the effectiveness of a member of Congress. Congressional experts have repeatedly told us that there are many other ways to evaluate the effectiveness of a member beyond getting a sponsored bill passed in committee. Members can get language included in other bills, co-sponsor bills, hold hearings, negotiate agreements or provide constituent service (for example, help with getting Social Security benefits). A member might only pass one bill, but it could be a particularly important one. Roy Meyers, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, called the InsideGov analysis "clickbait garbage." "It is a well-known fact that members of the House minority are naturally disadvantaged in having their bills reported by the committees controlled by their opponents," he said. Meyers said that among political scientists, the most sophisticated attempt to evaluate legislator effectiveness that has been done recently was created by Craig Volden, a University of Virginia professor, and Alan Wiseman, a Vanderbilt University professor. Their "Legislative Effectiveness Score" measures how successful a representative is at moving his or her own bills through different stages of the legislative process, where each of those bills is also coded for its substantive significance. Then the professors compare members to average scores relative to those in a similar party status (majority or minority), level of seniority, and chair position (committee or subcommittee chair). In the 113th Congress, Patrick Murphy scored 0.350. An average minority-party member with his seniority (freshman term) would be expected at 0.391. So Murphy is slightly lower than the average but considered to be close enough. "So he meets expectations according to our criteria," Volden told PolitiFact Florida. GovTrack, a website that tracks congressional legislation, publishes an annual report card with rankings in various categories rather than just one. For example, it ranked Murphy as No. 2 among House Democrats for writing bipartisan bills in 2015. "We would never reduce effectiveness to a single number (and we don't generally make value judgments about whether a member is doing a good or bad job)," said Josh Tauberer, founder of GovTrack. "InsideGov's analysis demonstrates a total failure to understand how politics works." Murphy’s campaign pointed to instances of him getting bill language out of a committee as a freshman. In May 2013, Murphy introduced HR 1974, a bill that would have changed how the Small Business Administration gave out loans for businesses rebuilding after a disaster. Instead of being reported out of committee, Murphy’s language was attached to HR 4121 as an amendment along with other SBA-related changes and sent from the Small Business Committee to the House. No action was taken on the bill. In October 2013, Murphy was a cosponsor and co-author of HR 3329, a bill concerning banking regulations. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., was listed as the sponsor, but Murphy’s campaign noted he and Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., managed the bill in the House. In the Congressional Record, Capito credited Murphy for writing the bill with Luetkemeyer. The bill eventually became law. Rubio himself has taken credit for legislative victories by getting language inserted into other bills, so he considers that a measure of effectiveness. His campaign also cited examples of Murphy playing a role in legislation passed during the current session of Congress that wasn’t included in the InsideGov analysis. For example, in April the House unanimously passed the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act introduced by Murphy and U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla. The bill will allow competition in the flood insurance marketplace. It hasn’t received a vote in the Senate yet. Our ruling The American Future Fund ad said,"Patrick Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen." This is based on a ranking of one group that narrowly looks at Murphy’s record by only including bills he sponsored that passed out of committee through 2014. Congressional experts have told us that there are multiple ways to influence legislation and be an effective member which aren’t captured by this analysis of only part of his tenure. The ad also omits that as a freshman Democrat, Murphy had little chance of getting legislation through committee. The majority of members on the "least effective" list are freshmen Democrats. Another analysis shows that he met expectations for a freshman of the minority party. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d7f3db04-9f93-4463-91ce-ba59c1368983	None	American Future Fund	None	None	None	2016-09-09T17:32:34	2016-09-01	['United_States']
pomt-00151	"Burger King admits to using horse meat in burgers, Whoppers."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/24/blog-posting/burger-king-doesnt-use-horse-meat-burgers-viral-po/	A viral blog post claims that fast food chain Burger King has "recently confessed" that horse meat has been used in its burgers and Whoppers. The article on the Blogspot site called "Everyday Useful Info" is accompanied with an image that shows Burger King’s logo next to the front half of a horse with the rest of its body falling into a bowl as ground meat. The article was posted on Oct. 7, 2017, but it’s been circulating again on Facebook, even though Burger King has "confessed" to nothing of the sort. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post has enjoyed more than 1 million Facebook interactions and 243,000 shares, CrowdTangle data show. The article and website themselves contain plenty of red flags about their veracity: "Alexandra," a name at the bottom of the post, hints at the article’s author. However, Alexandra’s Blogger profile shows she joined the site in May 2016, but she has no image or contact info. It also says she runs a blog called, "Handy Topics," but the link to that website produced an error message this week. On Everyday Useful Info’s website, a tab that says "Contact Us" does not display any contact information when clicked. A page of the site displays some text in French, while another page is in English. Though clunky, the site is still active and features other recent posts like "Being in a Happy Relationship is Making You Fat, Scientist Confirms," posted Oct. 23, 2018. The article is riddled with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, such as this one: "This fast food chain finally gave up pretending and apologized to the honest costumers (sic) about the test being wrong all the time," the post reads. And then there’s the topic: Did Burger King really admit to using horse meat? In short, no. But the tale does have its roots in a real news story. In 2013, the fast-food chain announced it had stopped buying beef from Silvercrest Foods in 2013 after tests found horse DNA in some products, according to the Associated Press. At the time, Burger King announced that the decision was a "voluntary and precautionary measure" and "not a food safety issue." In its story, Everyday Useful Info names "Silvercrest," as the firm that provided the horse meat. Burger King Worldwide on Jan. 31, 2013, issued a press release regarding the Silvercrest scandal. It stated that it had been notified that health officials were investigating Silvercrest’s products, which prompted the restaurant chain to conduct its own investigation. "Our independent DNA tests results on product taken from BURGER KING® restaurants were negative for any equine DNA," the press release said. "However, four samples recently taken from the Silvercrest plant have shown the presence of very small trace levels of equine DNA. This product was never sold to our restaurants." Burger King said that its investigation established that Silvercrest used "a small percentage of beef imported from a non-approved supplier in Poland. They promised to deliver 100% British & Irish beef patties and have not done so." "This is a clear violation of our specifications, and we have terminated our relationship with them. Through our investigation, we have confirmed that this non-approved Polish supplier is the same company identified by the Irish Department of Agriculture as the source of Silvercrest's contamination issue." Burger King stated that on Jan. 23, 2013, it transitioned all of its UK, Ireland and Denmark suppliers to other suppliers from Germany and Italy: "These suppliers have provided DNA evidence to confirm their products are free of equine DNA. These are the product being sold in our restaurants today." Our ruling Not once in its statement did Burger King say, as this article in Everyday Useful Info states, that it was using horse meat in its burgers and whoppers. The Everyday Useful Info post blows the 2013 horse meat scare out of proportion, framing the incident as an intentional deception on Burger King’s part. The article is similar to other viral claims that have falsely alleged that human meat was found in a McDonald’s factory. We rate this article False.

pomt-11559	At the State of the Union address, Democrats, "even on positive news … were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not?"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/06/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-about-treason/	President Donald Trump’s visit to the Sheffer Corp. near Cincinnati was billed as a chance to discuss the recently enacted tax law. While Trump did discuss the tax law, most coverage of the speech led with a digression in which Trump accused Democrats of treason. It came as Trump was touting a drop in African-American unemployment, as he had done on several occasions previously. He knocked Democrats for their failure to applaud when he mentioned this during his State of the Union address. "You’re up there, you’ve got half the room going totally crazy, wild — they loved everything, they want to do something great for our country," Trump said on Feb. 5. "And you have the other side, even on positive news — really positive news, like that — they were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much." There’s actually a very good reason why not: The Constitution. "It was a profoundly stupid and ignorant statement," said Carlton F.W. Larson, a law professor at the the University of California-Davis who is writing a book about treason and the American Revolution. "There are occasional hard cases where it is debatable whether something constitutes treason. But this is not one of them." The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told NBC News the following day that Trump had been "tongue in cheek," and in the daily White House briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, "The president was clearly joking with his comments." Still, we’ve decided to fact-check Trump’s statement for two reasons. First, the long lead-up to the "treason" comment came off as entirely serious, and while the reference to "treason" itself was uttered in a flip manner, it fell short of being clearly a joke. (Watch the video and judge for yourself here.) Second, the Constitution is very clear when it comes to the definition of treason. The Constitution -- which mentions very few crimes specifically -- defines treason this way: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court. "The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted." This is a narrow definition. On the most basic level, treason has to occur in wartime, or during an armed rebellion against the government. With the possible exception of an American "levying war" against U.S. troops in a place like Afghanistan, "the biggest-picture takeaway is that there is no treason occurring on any side now," said Jed Shugerman, a legal historian at Fordham Law School. Indeed, Shugerman has previously cautioned those on the left who would label members of Trump’s circle as treasonous for allegedly cooperating with Russia during the 2016 election. The most fundamental reason why the word "treason" would be inaccurate in such cases, Shugerman and others argue, is that the United States is not at war with Russia. "We are not at war with Russia under any fair understanding of the word," he said. Shugerman added that even a notion like "cyberwar" with Russia is a metaphor for war rather than an actual deadly conflict, unless that cyberwar were to escalate to, say, hacking into nuclear power plants with the intent of exploding them. Calling U.S.-Russia relations "war" is no more accurate than calling the Super Bowl "war" just because the players talk about battle plans and how to attack their enemy, he said. Because the definition of treason is so narrow, charges have only been brought a few dozen times in the country’s history, and none, apparently, since the end of World War II, which -- perhaps not coincidentally -- was the last officially declared war. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A rendering of the Whiskey Rebellion. (Wikimedia commons) Charges of treason have been prosecuted in relation to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794; against Aaron Burr (who was acquitted); Thomas W. Dorr, who set up a parallel government of Rhode Island in the 1840s (he was convicted but later pardoned); and a number of cases related to slavery and the Civil War. There was a flurry of treason cases during and after World War II, including the poet Ezra Pound for pro-Axis propaganda (he was hospitalized for insanity) and the broadcast propagandists known as Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally (both of whom served prison time). The rarity of treason charges can also be seen in the examples of actions that never drew a treason charge. When Eugene V. Debs was prosecuted for encouraging draft avoidance during World War I, he was charged with sedition, not treason. During the Cold War, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of espionage charges, not treason. (Espionage does not have to occur during wartime, or even against an enemy.) And Jane Fonda was never charged with treason for allegations of anti-Americanism when she consorted with the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War. Legal scholars we contacted unanimously said Trump’s words were ill-conceived. "It’s not only legally frivolous and offensive to suggest that an act of political protest as simple as not clapping isn’t treason, but it’s wholly ignorant of why the Constitution has a treason clause in the first place — to prevent what was a common practice in England at the time, in which the government labeled its political opponents as ‘traitors’ and used that as an excuse to throw them in jail," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas. "Being rude and partisan does not come close to the constitutional definition of treason," agreed Robert F. Turner, a fellow at the Center for National Security Law at the University of Virginia. Michael C.H. McDaniel, the director of Homeland Security Law Programs at Western Michigan University, said there could hardly be a clearer example of protected political speech than the one Trump decided to label treasonous. "Expressing partisan disagreement with the president is not treason -- in fact, it is political speech, the core speech to which the First Amendment is protecting from the Federal government," he said. Our ruling Trump said that at the State of the Union address, Democrats, "even on positive news … were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not?" There’s a good reason why not: Declining to applaud the president doesn’t come anywhere near meeting the constitutionally defined threshold of treason, which in any case can’t occur except in wartime. Rather, legal experts agree that it is a clear case of constitutionally protected free speech. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-10062	The stimulus bill includes "$300,000 for a sculpture garden in Miami."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/26/eric-cantor/does-stimulus-package-really-include-300000-sculpt/	As part of their attack on the Democratic-led $835 billion economic stimulus package, some Republicans have attempted to discredit the plan by singling out examples of what they consider the most outrageous spending. In an interview with Fox News on Jan. 23, 2009, Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip, said that in a meeting with President Obama, Cantor asked if he "could use his influence on this process to try and get the pork barrel spending out of the bill. I mean, there's $300,000 for a sculpture garden in Miami." But do a word search on "sculpture" in the 647-page stimulus bill now before the House and you'll come up blank. It's not in there. So we asked Cantor's office where he came up with it. Here's how spokesman Neil Bradley explained it: The House stimulus bill includes $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. The bill states that the money would be "distributed in direct grants to fund arts projects and activities which preserve jobs in the nonprofit arts sector threatened by declines in philanthropic and other support during the current economic downturn." It's the lack of detail that particularly bothers Cantor, Bradley said. "We don't know what they're going to spend it on," Bradley said. "There is no direction to the NEA on how to spend it." So to give people an idea of how the NEA spends its money, Cantor's staff looked at some recent grants awarded by the NEA. And in 2008, the NEA gave $300,000 to the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami to restore an outdoor statuary. The Vizcaya estate is one of the country's most intact remaining examples from the American Renaissance, a period when the very wealthy built estates to look European. The $300,000 grant was to help restore some of the outdoor sculptures — statues, urns and fountains — that had been severely deteriorating due to South Florida's salty, damp and subtropical climate, not to mention the hurricanes. But again, this was an NEA grant from last year . It is not in the proposed $835 billion stimulus package that is being pushed by President Obama and congressional Democrats. In fact, because the sculpture garden's money has already been granted, it's probably safe to say that this is one project that specifically won’t be part of the spending. We get the Cantor camp's argument that there are no specific projects tied to the funding in the proposed NEA allotment. When all is said and done, there may very well be plenty of NEA projects that some find objectionable or wasteful. This just isn't one of them. Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wis., House Appropriations Committee chairman, defended the proposed funding to the NEA. "Artists need jobs just like everyone else," Brost said. "Fifty million out of $825 billion doesn't seem like an extreme amount to support our artists." The bottom line here is that Cantor specifically identified the sculpture garden as part of the stimulus package when it just isn't — which his staff acknowledges. And he has made that false claim repeatedly. He was quoted saying something similar in a Richmond newspaper. That's not just sculpting the facts. That's Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-08340	"Congressman Kasich wants to use our tax dollars to give secret bonuses to his corporate friends."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/28/ted-strickland/strickland-claim-about-kasich-giving-secret-bonuse/	Taking words out of context is an old practice in political advertising. John Kasich, Republican candidate for governor, makes it almost too easy. A case in point is "New Plan," a TV ad for Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. It says Kasich "wants to use our tax dollars to bring his corporate friends to Ohio to be in charge of jobs." The campaign's online posting for the ad goes even further: "Congressman Kasich wants to use our tax dollars to give secret bonuses to his corporate friends." As evidence, it uses video of Kasich talking with reporters after an Aug. 17 news conference announcing his proposal to replace the Ohio Department of Development with JobsOhio, a nonprofit corporation operated in large part by private money. The 30-second spot opens by saying that Kasich, as a congressman, "outsourced our jobs and made millions in bonuses on Wall Street." PolitiFact Ohio previously examined the charge about outsourcing jobs and rated it False. The claim about "millions in bonuses" is unproven and speculative. Kasich has not disclosed his pay or bonuses from eight years as a managing director for Lehman Brothers, except for a tax return showing he made $182,692 in salary and a $432,000 bonus in 2008. "Now," the ad says next, "Kasich wants to use our tax dollars to bring his corporate friends to Ohio to be in charge of jobs." Then it shows him saying: "We won't have any pay restrictions there. If they deserve a bonus, we'll give them a bonus. You all are familiar with bonuses. We will not require them to disclose their bonus." The ad asks: "Wall Street CEO's being paid secret bonuses? Isn't that what got us into trouble in the first place?" Kasich, on video, chortles, "It's going to be fantastic." PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at the claim posted with the video; that "Congressman Kasich wants to use our tax dollars to give secret bonuses to his corporate friends." We found a somewhat different sense of his comments and proposal emerges from unedited footage of the media scrum. It was posted on OhioCapitalBlog by Marc Kovac, bureau chief for Dix Newspapers and Youngstown Vindicator. On it, Kasich says JobsOhio would be "run like a business," with the governor as chairman of an appointed board of directors. Staff workers would not be public employees, to avoid civil service restrictions on pay. "We won’t have any pay restrictions there," Kasich says. "We’re going to pay them on the basis of how they produce. If they deserve a bonus, we’ll give them a bonus. You all are familiar with bonuses. So anyway, it’s going to be professionalized." He gushes that "it's going to be fantastic" more than a minute later, after saying, "We'll have recruiters go all over the country" to find qualified workers. His comment that "you all are familiar with bonuses" is a quip intended as a joke for reporters and a clutch of nodding aides, and it draws a laugh. The line that "we will not require them to disclose their bonus" is edited in, from minutes later in the session. Kasich says it with a straight face, but campaign press secretary Rob Nichols said, "It was absolutely a joke. He has been asked about it time and again, and he said the group will be transparent." In fact, Kasich's tendency to use deadpan irony or sarcasm is seen more clearly when a reporter asks if the nonprofit group would hold open meetings. "No, no, no, it's going to be completely secret, it's going to be a secret society like Skull and Bones," Kasich responds. Then he adds, "No, we have an obligation to let people know what's going on. ... It will have a high degree of transparency." Kasich admitted that privacy issues were not settled. Questions have been raised whether the state can become an owner of a corporation and whether it is legal or constitutional to privatize a government duty and mingle tax dollars with private money. He does not suggest paying more than "necessary expenses" to board members, who he says would be corporate CEOs. The nonprofit’s operating staff would be eligible for bonuses and be paid "very competitive salaries," he says. "We're not hiring political friends or contributors or any of that other crap that's been going on in this state. ... We don't have time for political hacks, which I think we've filled these operations with for too darn long." While the words in the ad did come out of Kasich’s mouth, they are from edited video that links statements out of context. Without that context, viewers have no way of knowing that some of the lines clearly were said in jest, and they are instead presented as if Kasich is serious. And Kasich clearly says during his conversation with reporters that bonuses would go to workers for JobsOhio and that they could not be secret, but would instead be public. Taking comments from different parts of conversation and linking them together to bolster a message is more than just false, it’s deceptive to a point of ridiculous. For a statement like this -- "Kasich wants to use our tax dollars to give secret bonuses to his corporate friends" -- there’s only one answer: Pants on Fire!

pomt-06970	"Our country's got this huge debt, and (President Barack) Obama says raise taxes and keep spending more."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/14/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-barack-obama-wants-raise-taxes/	Crossroads GPS -- a deep-pocketed conservative advocacy group -- unveiled an advertisement on July 8, 2011, that targets voters who may have supported Barack Obama in 2008 but have become disaffected by the direction of the economy during his tenure. The group says the ad -- called "Wake Up" -- will be aired at a cost of $7 million on national cable channels as well as network television in 11 states and 10 key House districts. We saw it airing as recently as July 14, 2011. A reader asked us to take a look at the ad, so we did. The ad features a mother lying awake at night worrying about her family’s economic situation. She says she supported Obama initially "because he spoke so beautifully, but since then things have gone from bad to much worse." She says Obama’s stimulus didn’t improve the economy, and that the national debt worries her. "Our country's got this huge debt," the ad says, "and Obama says raise taxes and keep spending more? Doesn't Washington know we can't afford more taxes and debt? … There’s got to be a way to take away President Obama’s blank check." In this item, we’re focusing on the question of whether Obama’s approach is to "raise taxes and keep spending more." We’ll start by acknowledging a challenge with rating this claim. The most important fiscal debate currently under way involves the raising of the debt ceiling -- the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow. After hitting the debt ceiling earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department juggled accounts as a temporary measure to buy time for further negotiations. But officials now expect the debt limit to be reached on Aug. 2, 2011. While the negotiations have been high profile, they are fluid, and have largely been conducted in private. Instead of relying on official position papers, we are left with broadly worded public utterances by the participants and comments by unnamed aides reported in the media. And what is proposed one day may not remain operative the next. That said, we do think there’s enough information on the Obama administration’s position on taxes and spending to enable us to judge whether the president has really said his approach is to "raise taxes and keep spending more." First, taxes. On this issue, the ad is on relatively safe ground. By all accounts, the biggest divide in the negotiations has been strong resistance among key Republicans, particularly House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., to raising any taxes as part of a final deal. Republicans in this camp want to see spending cuts alone. Democrats, on the other hand, believe that whatever deal is reached needs to include some tax increases, rather than just spending cuts. The White House portrays the tax increases it’s seeking as either targeted -- for instance, closing provisions it considers loopholes -- or aimed at the richest Americans, particularly by letting tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush lapse for the highest tax bracket. Still, no matter how targeted, these policies would, as the ad says, "raise taxes." Here’s how Obama explained his position on taxes in a July 11, 2011, press conference. "What we have talked about is that starting in 2013, that we have gotten rid of some of these egregious loopholes that are benefiting corporate jet owners or oil companies at a time where they're making billions of dollars of profits," he said. "What we have said is as part of a broader package, we should have revenues, and the best place to get those revenues are from folks like me who have been extraordinarily fortunate, and that millionaires and billionaires can afford to pay a little bit more -- going back to the Bush tax rates. "And what I've also said to Republicans is, if you don't like that formulation, then I'm happy to work with you on tax reform that could potentially lower everybody's rates and broaden the base, as long as that package was sufficiently progressive so that we weren’t balancing the budget on the backs of middle-class families and working-class families, and we weren’t letting hedge fund managers or authors of best-selling books off the hook." So Obama does want a tax hike -- at least some specific tax hikes -- as part of a deal. Does he also want to "keep spending more?" As we analyzed this question, we assumed that "spending more" meant actually increasing levels of spending. On this point, we think the ad is misleading. At the same press conference, Obama said that he has "agreed to a series of spending cuts that will make the government leaner, meaner, more effective, more efficient and give taxpayers a greater bang for their buck. That includes defense spending. That includes health spending. It includes some programs that I like very much, and we -- be nice to have but that we can’t afford right now. And if you look at this overall package, we could achieve a situation in which our deficits were at a manageable level and our debt levels were stabilized, and the economy as a whole I think would benefit from that." In his July 14, 2011, press briefing, White House spokesman Jay Carney offered additional specifics. "We are now in a situation where our side, the White House, has made clear in a presentation yesterday that there are significant cuts -- $1.5 trillion in cuts that everybody can agree on, real and significant; an additional $200 billion in cuts that essentially we believe everybody can agree on," Carney said. "That’s $1.7 trillion, significant in and of itself. The president wants more." Neither Obama nor Carney cited specific cuts he’d accept. (And the White House didn’t provide us with a list.) That’s not very surprising, since both sides are in the midst of a closed-doors negotiation. Media coverage has provided a slightly more detailed picture. Cantor himself indicated that the two sides had found some common ground on spending cuts. Referring to informal agreements from an earlier round of debt-ceiling talks led by Vice President Joe Biden, Cantor said that "what the Biden group produced are areas where we believe we can come to an agreement," Dow Jones Newswire reported on July 11. And Obama himself had sought larger cuts than the Biden-led negotiations had produced. Under a $4 trillion "grand bargain" proposed by the president but rejected by Republicans, "Obama was poised to accept cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and possibly Social Security in exchange for $1 trillion in revenue, mostly from repealing President George W. Bush’s cuts for the wealthiest Americans after 2012," Bloomberg reported on July 14. Crossroads GPS, spokesman Jonathan Collegio said it’s one thing for the White House to say it will accept a spending cut and another to actually accept it. "Send me Obama’s ’proposed spending cuts.’ I’m not aware of any specific cuts he has officially proposed," Collegio said. "The only actual proposal I’m aware of was his budget, which failed 97-0 in the Senate." He added that as recently as June, Obama proposed a new round of construction loans. "So there are all these specific spending increases and spending increase proposals, weighed against a number thrown around in the negotiations but without any specific cuts called for whatsoever," Collegio said. We see his point -- we, too, wish we could see more details about concrete commitments to spending cuts by the administration. However, we think that what Obama and Carney have said -- and what has trickled out from comments by the negotiators, including the acknowledgement by Cantor of common ground on spending cuts -- undercuts the ad’s claim that Obama’s intention is to "keep spending more." The ad is right about tax increases but incorrect about spending increases. On balance, we rate it Half True.	None	Crossroads GPS	None	None	None	2011-07-14T17:39:50	2011-07-14	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-06071	"Ballistic tests have confirmed that the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent was caused by" weapons that were part of a federal arms trafficking operation.	false	/texas/statements/2012/jan/08/david-dewhurst/texas-lt-gov-david-dewhurst-says-ballistics-tests-/	The same day that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at the LBJ presidential library in Austin, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst of Texas called for Holder's resignation in a post on his campaign website that pointed to the "Fast and Furious scandal" as the "latest evidence that Holder is failing to perform his duties in a competent manner." The Dec. 13, 2011, post said the federal government's "walking" of guns — into the hands of criminals and across the U.S.-Mexico border — had endangered people in both countries. "Ballistic tests have confirmed that the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent was caused by one of the DOJ-walked weapons," the post says, referring to the U.S. Department of Justice. We wondered whether Dewhurst, who is seeking the U.S. Senate seat to be vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison, was right about what ballistics tests found. First, some background: Fast and Furious was a multi-agency federal arms-trafficking investigation that took place in Arizona from late 2009 to early 2011 and was led by the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, an agency of the Justice Department. In the operation, agents allowed firearms to be illegally purchased in Arizona, with the goal of tracking at least some guns to Mexican drug cartels and eventually building a case against cartel leaders. Along the way, though, agents lost track of at least 1,300 guns — with some subsequently linked to crimes in Mexico and the United States, including the Dec. 14, 2010, slaying of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in Arizona. Dewhurst's campaign did not respond to our requests for information supporting his campaign's claim that ballistics information confirmed Terry's killing by a Fast and Furious weapon. We reviewed news reports, congressional reports and public testimony, which indicated that two Fast and Furious guns were recovered from the scene of Terry's shooting. However, we found no federal ballistics information confirming that the bullet that killed Terry was fired from one of the guns. According to a press release from the U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix, Terry was shot during a firefight with a group of armed "illegal aliens" while on patrol with other agents in a canyon near Rio Rico, Ariz. — about 10 miles north of the border city of Nogales. The slaying helped push Fast and Furious into the national spotlight, and the operation is under investigation by the Justice Department's inspector-general, the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Eleven months after the shooting, Holder told a Senate panel on Nov. 8, 2011, that "any instance of so-called gun walking is simply unacceptable" and that "regrettably, this tactic was used as part of Fast and Furious, which was launched to combat gun trafficking and violence on our Southwest border." Holder continued, telling the Judiciary Committee that "this operation was flawed in its concept and flawed in its execution, and unfortunately we will feel the effects for years to come as guns that were lost during this operation continue to show up at crime scenes both here and in Mexico." News organizations have widely reported that the two rifles found at the scene of Terry's slaying were part of Fast and Furious. According to a July 21, 2011, Los Angeles Times article, ATF supervisors acknowledged in emails two days after Terry’s slaying that the guns were part of the botched operation. And according to a Sept. 11 Times story, the Phoenix ATF field office sent out an agency-wide bulletin the day after Terry’s death saying that the guns were Fast and Furious weapons. Separately, a June 14, 2011, report released by Grassley and U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who leads the House oversight committee, includes a copy of a Dec. 15, 2010, ATF email that says: "The two firearms recovered by ATF this afternoon near Rio Rico, Arizona, in conjunction with the shooting death of U.S. Border Patrol agent Terry were identified as 'Suspect Guns' in the Fast and Furious investigation." Grassley has offered yet more support for the link, through news releases, written statements prepared for congressional hearings, and direct questioning of administration officials. A digital collection of documents on the senator's website includes a copy of a Justice Department email dated Dec. 17, 2010, to Gary Grindler, then the acting deputy attorney general. The email notes that a border agent was killed in Arizona earlier that week and says two weapons recovered from the scene had been linked to Jaime Avila Jr., "a straw firearms purchaser that ATF and USAO (U.S. attorney's office) for Arizona have been investigating since November 2009 as part of its larger Fast and Furious operation." During the November 2011 hearing, Holder did not dispute the statement, repeated frequently by senators, that the guns at the scene of Terry's slaying were part of Fast and Furious. However, in response to a question from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, about whether he had apologized to Terry's family, Holder said that it's unfair "to assume that the mistakes that happened in Fast and Furious directly led to the death of Agent Terry." He did not elaborate. So, it appears to be undisputed that two Fast and Furious guns were present at Terry's killing. And what of the ballistics testing? The only information we found about ballistics testing and Terry's death was an FBI report completed shortly after the shooting. The report, dated Dec. 23, 2010, says that the bullet that killed Terry could have been fired from the kind of guns that were found at the scene but that "firearms examinations" could not determine if the bullet came from either of the found weapons. The report — posted online July 26, 2011, by the Times and described in a story the next day — says the bullet "was fired from a barrel rifled with four grooves, right twist, such as the K2 and K3 rifles" — the guns found at the scene. "However," the report says, "due to a lack of sufficient agreement in the individual microscopic marks of value, it could not be determined if the … bullet was fired from the barrel of the K2 or K3 rifles." Neither the FBI nor the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego, which is handling the Terry case, would comment to us about ballistics tests. Finally, we talked with the House oversight committee and Grassley's office. Becca Watkins, a spokeswoman for committee Chairman Issa, told us that the Times' reporting about the FBI report was accurate, although she said the committee is waiting for the Justice Department to respond to requests for more information. "The ballistics report for the guns recovered at Agent Terry's crime scene do not rule out the Operation Fast and Furious guns as the weapon in his death," she said. But she suggested that it wasn't accurate to say that the report confirmed one of them was responsible for his death. At a Dec. 8, 2011, hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, asked Holder whether the department had "identified the weapon that actually killed Agent Terry." Holder replied that he was "not prepared to talk about that" because the investigation is ongoing. Our ruling By all accounts, Fast and Furious weapons were found at the scene of a U.S. agent's death. Dewhurst's campaign was emphatic, though, that ballistics tests confirmed that the weapons killed the agent. We found no information indicating that's so. Dewhurst's statement rates False.

pomt-12161	"You have almost half the counties in America that have one provider or no provider for insurance" on the Obamacare exchanges.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/04/sean-duffy/nearly-half-counties-have-no-providers-or-one-heal/	Two Republican talking points in attacking Obamacare are particularly prominent. One is that the health care law has failed, as House Speaker Paul Ryan declared in a January 2017 claim that, in one form or another, continues to be repeated. We rated it Mostly False. The Affordable Care Act did not meet all its promises, including a big one -- that you could keep your insurance plan if you liked it. But health care costs have risen more slowly since the law took effect and the law has met its major goal of getting more people insured, an estimated 20 million. Another Obamacare attack, often stated in the same breath, is that in much of the country health insurance providers are drying up. One of Ryan’s fellow Wisconsin Republicans, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, made that claim July 20, 2017, in a television interview on EWTN, a Catholic network. "We let Democrats off the hook," Duffy said. "They gave us a failing health care package. You have almost half the counties in America that have one provider or no provider for insurance. This law is crumbling." Markets with fewer insurers have been linked to fewer affordable choices for health insurance and higher prices. As we’ll see, Duffy might be right -- but he’s a bit ahead of it’s time. Trump’s similar claim To be clear, Duffy is referring to the relatively few Americans who buy their own health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges, not the vast majority who are covered by an employer or a government program such as Medicare. In March 2017, when President Donald Trump claimed that one-third of the nation’s counties "only have one insurer left" on the exchanges, PolitiFact National’s rating was True. There was only one insurance provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation’s counties, based on figures from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected authority on health care. But that was four months before Duffy’s claim. And Duffy’s claim goes further than those made by many Republicans. Duffy’s evidence To back Duffy’s statement, his office cited a June 2017 analysis by the New York Times. It estimated that 1,433 counties -- or about 45 percent of all counties -- are expected to have one insurer or no insurers in the Obamacare marketplaces, unless another carrier steps in. The marketplaces are where 12 million people buy their own coverage. The Times said it used Kaiser data showing which companies currently offer plans in each county, and combined that with announcements from insurance companies saying which counties they plan to exit or enter in 2018. So, the 45 percent is an estimate for 2018, not a current count. Currently, according to the article and Kaiser data, 1,036 counties have one provider. That’s 33 percent of all counties. There aren’t any counties right now that have no insurers on the exchanges. Other views The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a nonprofit research group, also confirmed that 33 percent of counties in 2017 have only one health insurer on the exchanges. And, like the Times, it estimates that in 2018, 45 percent of counties will have one insurer or none. Two health care experts, however, told us it’s too soon to say whether the 45 percent figure will be accurate. Cynthia Cox, the associate director of Kaiser’s program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance, said most states haven’t disclosed enough information publicly to make such an estimate. And Urban Institute health policy fellow John Holahan said that while 45 percent might be a fair estimate currently, the percentage likely will turn out to be lower because more insurers will probably enter the exchanges for 2018. (By the way, Wisconsin tends to fare well on these measures. In 2017, according to Kaiser, the number of insurers on the exchanges ranged from 1 -- in Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming -- to 15 in Wisconsin. The average was four.) One note before we close: Counties with one provider or no provider are concentrated in rural areas. So, even though one-third of counties currently have only one insurer, only about one in every five people who buy that insurance is affected. Our rating Duffy said: "You have almost half the counties in America that have one provider or no provider for insurance" on the Obamacare exchanges. Currently, 33 percent of counties have only one company selling health insurance policies to individuals on the Obamacare exchanges. There are no counties that have no providers. The element of truth in Duffy’s claim is that the New York Times estimates that in 2018, 45 percent of counties will have one provider or no providers. But that’s a projection and the article notes that the current figure is 33 percent. We rate Duffy’s statement Mostly False. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2017-08-04T05:00:00	2017-07-20	['United_States']
pomt-06709	Says Oregon state employees received a "catch-up" pay raise in 1981 -- just two years after they agreed not to take a raise in exchange for a retirement benefit.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/sep/02/dennis-richardson/dennis-richardson-says-state-employees-received-15/	The Public Employees Retirement System is the topic that never quits doling out potential PolitiFacts. On the final day of the 2011 legislative session, for example, Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, had this to say about failed efforts to get public employees to start paying the 6 percent "employee share" that public employers (otherwise known as taxpayers) have been paying since 1979. "In 1979, there was a collective bargaining agreement that said, ‘No pay increases but we'll pick up the 6 percent as the employer on the retirement plan.' In 1981, the negotiators for collective bargaining said, ‘We haven't had a raise in four years,’ and so they ended up with a 15.3 percent increase in pay, but the 6 percent payment toward the retirement plan didn't get repealed." In a follow-up e-mail to The Oregonian, he said that the 6 percent pickup should have been repealed with the 15.3 percent pay increase, "but it was allowed to continue on top of the ‘catch-up’ pay increase." Richardson’s assertion is significant because it could undermine a key argument made by public employees, who say they are entitled to the pickup because it was given to them in lieu of a raise. If they got a larger-than-usual raise to make up for no raise, as he claims, shouldn’t they forfeit the other benefit? Many taxpayers might think so. But how correct are the representative’s facts? Remember that the late 1970s and early 1980s were a time of severe economic stress. Inflation was in the double-digits, and cost-of-living raises for those lucky enough to have a job were similarly high. Richardson is right that in May 1979, the state agreed to start paying the 6 percent retirement pickup previously withheld from employees’ paychecks. But he’s not right that employees agreed to no pay increases in that contract negotiation, which covered July 1979 through June 1981. The labor agreement called for employees who made just under $12,000 a year to receive a 1 percent salary increase on July 1, 1979. Additionally, all employees were to receive a maximum 2 percent cost-of-living increase five times over two years, up to 10 percent. In July 1981, a new state contract gave all workers a $55 monthly increase -- which Richardson calculates as an average 4.3 percent increase. We agree. They also agreed to cost of living increases totalling 11 percent from January 1982 to March 1983. A union spokesperson told The Oregonian at the time that the package would result in pay raises of 15.6 percent to 19 percent. This is what Richardson considers the "catch-up." Employees, however, did not get those raises as scheduled. State workers received the $55 monthly increase and a 2 percent COLA in January 1982, but a severe recession that year meant that employees had to wait until July 1983 for the rest of their cost-of-living increases, which totalled 9 percent. Furthermore, they didn’t get COLA cost-of-living increases in 1983-85 because the economy was so bad. So Richardson’s facts are not entirely accurate. Still, we wanted to know whether the increases state employees did receive beat inflation. In other words, how generous was the state? Essentially, employees over 1979-81 received about a 16 percent "wage" increase, if you include the 6 percent retirement pickup. At the time, inflation was 25 percent -- or, to break it down, 14 percent in 1979, 13 percent in 1980 and 9 percent in 1981, adjusted for the state’s fiscal year calendars. State employees continued to lag behind inflation with the next contract, even with the retirement pickup. The "wage" increase over 1979-83 was 22 percent, at a time when inflation was 33 percent. That’s at least a a more than 10 percentage-point gap. The gap narrowed a little more with the 1983-85 contract: "Wages" increased 31 percent while the cost of living went up 39 percent. By the 1985-87 agreement, state workers’ wages had grown 39 percent since 1979 while the cost of living had gone up 43 percent. Again, that included the retirement benefit. If your eyes are glazing over, jump to the ruling. For those who want more evidence, we asked Tom Potiowsky, Oregon’s former state economist now at Portland State University, and Joshua Lehner, an economist with Oregon’s Office of Economic Analysis, to check our math. They came to to the same conclusion, but used a slightly different time period. Let’s start with a hypothetical $100 salary in June 1979. By July 1982 that $100 would be roughly $126 with the cost of living increases and 6 percent retirement money not being taken from paychecks. Inflation in the Portland-Salem area would have grown from $100 to $140, from 1978 to July 1982. So that’s a 15 percentage point difference. By July 1983, the $100 would have grown to $138 for state workers, and $144.50 under inflation. "This narrowed the gap, so that while inflation rose 44.5% from 1978 to July 1983, state wages rose 37.6 percent," Potiowsky said in an e-mail. "Wages still did not recover from inflation from 1978 to July 1983." Presented with our findings, Richardson said in an e-mail that we should look at private sector wages and the rate at which those grew -- or didn’t -- over this period. That wasn’t necessary for our ruling either, but the idea piqued our curiosity. So we turned to the crack economists at the Oregon Employment Department, who were kind enough to generate data on wages, adjusted for inflation to 1985 dollars. According to Employment Department numbers, state government workers lost 1.7 percent of their earning power from 1979-85 while private sector workers lost 3.9 percent. Again, this does not include the 6 percent pickup contribution. (But if you look at the graph, which charts a longer period, you’ll see that everyone did poorly. Private sector wages declined less because they were lower to start with and they didn’t drop as much as state worker wages. By the way, federal employees fared best.) The Ruling: So, did state employees make out like bandits? That’s a matter of opinion. Readers can decide for themselves whether they did, and whether they should continue to get their retirement contributions paid. What we can say for sure is that even with the 6 percent retirement pickup added back to paychecks, the 15.3 percent so-called "catch up" raise was not out of line given inflation. And two, state workers didn’t get most of that 15.3 percent increase until the next biennium, at which point COLA cost-of-living increases were frozen for another two years. State workers may have done better economically than private sector employees, but that’s not what Richardson said in his original statement. We find his statement False.

pomt-00633	"During Obama's first five years as president, black unemployment increased 42 percent. During Reagan's presidency, black unemployment dropped 20 percent."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/22/facebook-posts/was-ronald-reagans-record-black-unemployment-bette/	Recently, a reader forwarded us a social media meme that accused President Barack Obama of having a worse record on African-American employment than former President Ronald Reagan -- a charge which, if true, would be an embarrassment to the nation’s first black president. The meme says: "During Obama's first five years as president, black unemployment increased 42 percent. During Reagan's presidency, black unemployment dropped 20 percent." This text has been placed over a photograph of an African-American man wearing a T-shirt that reads, "I need a job." Is the meme correct? We took a closer look. We’ll start by noting that on its face, the comparison is odd. It compares Reagan’s full eight-year term to five years under Obama (not even the full six-plus years that Obama has been in office so far). Doing so is problematic because it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. In addition, the meme glosses over the question of how much impact a president has on unemployment among any racial or ethnic group. Their policies are generally considered to have some impact, but joblessness is also affected by factors beyond a president’s control, such as technological change and international economic competition. That said, the meme also has problems with the data. We’ll start by looking at the parameters the meme used, even though they are of questionable value. During Reagan’s full term -- January 1981 to January 1989 -- black unemployment fell from 14.6 percent to 11.8 percent. That’s a decline of 2.8 percentage points, or 19 percent. That’s close to what the meme said. But during Obama’s first five years -- January 2009 to January 2014 -- black unemployment didn’t rise at all, which is what the meme said. Rather, it fell from 12.7 percent to 12.1 -- a decline of 0.6 percentage points, or about 5 percent. The meme’s claim of a 42 percent increase is way off. Now let’s look at the first five years of each presidency -- a more reasonable comparison to make. During Reagan’s first five years -- January 1981 to January 1986 -- black unemployment fell from 14.6 percent to 14.5 percent. That’s a decline of 0.1 percentage point, or less than a 1 percent decrease. This is a lot less impressive than the meme’s favored eight-year decline of 20 percent. It’s also less impressive than the 5 percent decline during Obama’s first five years. If we instead look at Obama’s entire term to date -- January 2009 to April 2015 -- black unemployment fell from 12.7 percent to 9.6 percent. That’s down 3.1 percentage points, or a decrease of 24 percent. That’s a more impressive decline than under Reagan’s entire term. There are also other ways to compare the two presidents’ records on black unemployment. • The black unemployment rate peaked at 21.2 percent under Reagan in January 1983, but the peak under Obama was significantly lower -- 16.8 percent in March 2010. • The low point for black unemployment under Reagan was 11 percent, reached twice in 1988. The low point under Obama is 9.6 percent, which is the current rate. That’s lower than the lowest point under Reagan. • Under Reagan, black unemployment exceeded its worst level under Obama -- 16.8 percent -- for 26 consecutive months, or more than two years straight. Our ruling The meme says that "during Obama's first five years as president, black unemployment increased 42 percent. During Reagan's presidency, black unemployment dropped 20 percent." This claim is problematic on several levels. It presents a time frame cherry-picked to boost Reagan’s record. It flat-out misrepresents the statistics during Obama’s first five years, when black unemployment actually fell. And it ignores several other measures that show that black unemployment was better in absolute terms under Obama than Reagan. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12194	"You've got thousands of people serving in the military who are transgender."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/26/ted-lieu/thousands-transgender-americans-serve-military-con/	A California congressman fired back at President Donald Trump’s Twitter announcement barring transgender service members, saying the decision will affect thousands of people. Trump announced the decision in a series of tweets on July 26, 2017. "After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military," Trump wrote. "Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail." U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., later told CNN anchors John Berman and Poppy Harlow that Trump’s policy will force good people into hiding and prevent them from serving their country. "You've got thousands of people serving in the military who are transgender and they're doing a fantastic job," said Lieu, who holds the rank of colonel in the Air Force Reserves. Lieu repeated the sentiment in a statement he also echoed on his Facebook page and Twitter account. We wondered how many service members identified as transgender, something the U.S. Defense Department didn’t disclose to us. But a couple of estimates show that there are likely thousands of transgender soldiers, sailors and airmen. Estimates but no complete data Trump’s announcement reversed a policy announced under President Barack Obama in June 2016 that ended the service ban on transgender Americans, which had stayed in place even after Congress repealed the so-called Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell law for gays and lesbians in December 2010. Transgender soldiers, airmen and sailors would have faced being medically discharged for disclosing that information, but Obama’s policy allowed those service members to serve openly if they chose. His administration gave the military until July 1, 2017, to fully implement the rule. On June 30, Defense Secretary James Mattis delayed implementation by six months, before Trump appeared to revoke the rule entirely via Twitter. As many as 250 service members have asked to formally change their preferred genders, or have already been approved, the Associated Press has reported. The Defense Department would not elaborate on Trump’s announcement, including how many transgender people served in the military. Reports have said the Pentagon does not keep track of transgender personnel. Instead they sent us to the military’s transgender policy web page, which as of this writing had not yet been updated. A Defense Department spokesman said the policy would be revised "in the near future," with White House input. A Trump spokesman did not answer our attempts to contact him. Lieu spokesman Jack d’Annabale said the congressman got his estimate from a May 2014 brief by researchers at UCLA’s Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy. They used responses to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, sent to respondents by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality. The definition of transgender included "those whose gender identity or expression differs from those traditionally associated with their assigned sex at birth," according to the study. Extrapolating that 0.3 percent of the population identified as transgender, UCLA’s researchers estimated that there were "approximately 15,500 transgender individuals are serving on active duty or in the Guard or Reserve forces." It also said that about 134,400 transgender people were veterans or retired. Another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2015 used data from the UCLA brief and other sources to determine that 12,800 service member would be eligible for transgender health care. The study suggested of those, 188 would use benefits for transition services, at a cost of $4.2 million to $5.6 million. More recently, the Pentagon commissioned a June 2016 RAND Corporation report studying the effects of integrating transgender service members. (CNN’s Berman actually mentioned this one during Lieu’s interview.) The think tank estimated that there were between 1,320 and 6,630 active duty transgender personnel, and between 830 and 4,160 in the reserves. The midrange estimates were for 2,450 active duty and 1,510 reserve duty service members. As a side note to Trump’s concern over costs: Only a fraction of active duty transgender service members were likely to seek medical treatment, the study said, resulting in a high-end estimate of an $8.4 million increase in health care costs, or 0.13 percent. The RAND study used the National Transgender Discrimination Survey and other surveys, including private insurance data. RAND started with a lower population prevalence than UCLA did — 0.19 percent instead of 0.3 percent — accounting for the lower figure. If we combine the top RAND estimates for active duty and reserves, between 2,150 and 10,790 active duty and reserve service members may identify as transgender. Defense Department projections for the 2017 fiscal year were for 1.28 million active duty personnel and a little more than 800,000 in the reserves. Our ruling Lieu said, "You've got thousands of people serving in the military who are transgender and they're doing a fantastic job." There are no solid numbers from the Defense Department, but two sources have provided recent estimates extrapolated from survey and insurance data. One 2014 UCLA brief estimated as many as 15,500 active duty and reserve service members may identify as transgender. A 2016 RAND Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon suggested between 2,150 and 10,790 active and reserve duty troops. While both estimates said there are likely thousands of transgender people in the military, those are still estimates. Lieu should note that in his talking point. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02440	Says the U.S. Supreme Court found that "Social Security is not guaranteed."	true	/florida/statements/2014/feb/28/david-jolly/david-jolly-says-social-security-not-guaranteed-ac/	Social Security has been a popular political football during the campaign for Pinellas County’s open U.S. House seat, with both sides acknowledging the earned benefit program needs reform but differing on how it should be handled. During an untelevised debate in Clearwater on Feb. 25, candidates Alex Sink and David Jolly traded barbs over their platforms, with Sink attacking the Republican onstage by saying Jolly had declared that Social Security was not guaranteed. Jolly said that wasn’t his opinion, it’s actually what the highest court in the land had ruled. Jolly said it was up to elected officials to make sure seniors get their benefits. "In 1960, the United States Supreme Court in the Flemming decision said Social Security is not guaranteed," he said. "My fight is to make sure that is guaranteed." Jolly’s claim made us curious about what the courts have said about Social Security, so we decided to open the law books. Flemming vs. Nestor The case to which Jolly was referring is Flemming vs. Nestor, a 1960 case about a Bulgarian immigrant named Ephram Nestor who was deported in 1956 for having been a member of the Communist Party between 1933 and 1939. Nestor was not a citizen but had lived in the United States since 1913. Nestor retired in 1955 after paying into the Social Security fund for 19 years, since the program was created in 1936. When he was deported, his benefits were terminated under amended provisions of the Social Security Act of 1935. Nestor sued the federal government, claiming the benefits constituted a contract and that he deserved his payments after so many years of contributing to the system. (The other party in the case was Arthur S. Flemming, the secretary of health, education and welfare during Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency.) In a 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled there was no contractual obligation for the government to pay out Social Security benefits to Nestor. The ruling meant payments into the Social Security system could not be considered a person’s property rights if that person violated a rule set forth by Congress, UCLA law professor Katherine Stone told PolitiFact Florida. In Nestor's case, Congress made rules against belonging to the Communist Party, though it's worth pointing out the law didn't exist when Nestor actually was in the party. Still, the court said the after-the-fact prohibition was valid. "People who are denied (benefits) can’t say their property was taken from them, unless the change is arbitrary or lacks rational reasoning," Stone said, noting the denial couldn’t be punitive or violate a person’s right to due process. What could be considered unreasonable? "Just ending the program suddenly could be an irrational measure, " Stone suggested. "Moving the money into tax cuts for the rich could, too." Changing or suspending the program because of budget constraints, though, would likely pass muster with the courts. Jolly’s interpretation of that ruling is interesting, Stone said, because the case only deals with one specific category of beneficiary being denied payments for a specific reason. But beneficiaries could be denied benefits for any reason if Congress passed a law making it so, as long as the change wasn’t arbitrary. The court said Congress had the power to modify the rules, which it has done several times -- such as gradually raising the full retirement age over time. Political debates over Social Security payouts have been fueled by budget projections illustrating the widening chasm of the program paying out more than it is taking in. A 2005 Congressional Research Service report on Social Security reform pointed out that beneficiaries were not guaranteed "full benefits in the case of a shortfall, unless Congress amends applicable laws." Our ruling Jolly said the Supreme Court ruled "Social Security is not guaranteed." It’s a position he has repeated at debates and on the campaign trail. The 1960 Flemming vs. Nestor case Jolly cited indeed said citizens don’t have a right to Social Security benefits, no matter how long they paid into the system. Congress can change the rules how they see fit, as long as they follow due process. We rate the statement True.	None	David Jolly	None	None	None	2014-02-28T15:03:52	2014-02-25	['None']
pomt-14055	Says North Carolina Rep. Renee Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against "an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/may/23/george-holding/george-holding-accuses-renee-ellmers-breaking-part/	In their first debate, three candidates for the Republican nomination for North Carolina’s U.S. House District 2 squared off last week on who deserves to represent the area in Washington, D.C. The district was recently redrawn to include most of the suburban Wake County areas around Raleigh as well as all or part of the more rural Harnett, Johnston, Wilson, Nash and Franklin counties. In an oddity created by the new boundaries, two of the primary candidates are incumbents now fighting for the same seat. Throughout the debate, Rep. George Holding attempted to paint himself as a staunch conservative who won’t budge on controversial issues. Rep. Renee Ellmers attempted to paint herself as a more pragmatic conservative who would rather get things done. That fight was perhaps most apparent in a back-and-forth on immigration policy. Holding accused Ellmers of being too liberal in a 2015 vote. "We had an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants," Holding said. "Mrs. Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against that amendment." It’s true that Ellmers was the only Republican to vote no on that particular amendment, which was tacked onto a bill regarding Department of Homeland Security funding. She was also one of 10 Republicans who voted against the bill as a whole. However, the amendment in question did more than just prioritize the deportation of dangerous sexual criminals. It also would’ve prioritized people convicted of domestic violence or less serious, misdemeanor sexual crimes. And it was because of fears over unintended consequences of those extra provisions – which Holding neglected to mention – that Ellmers has long said she voted no. Immediately after the 2015 vote, Ellmers said in an interview with McClatchy’s D.C. bureau that she opposed it because it "may remove protections for victims of sexual assault or domestic abuse." That was the same stance taken by the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Both groups urged a ‘No’ vote, saying the amendment would lead to domestic and sexual violence going unreported. "Victims of domestic violence often do not seek help when they know that the consequences to the perpetrator (for example, a spouse or parent, or perhaps other family member) may result in the perpetrator’s deportation," the task force wrote to members of Congress. "This often takes place due to their financial dependence, and even close relationship to the perpetrator." The bishops agreed, writing: "While presented as a measure that helps domestic violence victims, we fear that it actually would discourage many such victims from reporting abuse." The amendment and the bill as a whole passed the House despite that opposition. But the amendment in question was removed by the Senate, which passed the bill and sent the new version back to the House, which approved it even though it didn’t include the amendment. President Obama then signed the bill into law. That chain of events led Ellmers, during the recent debate, to shoot back at Holding. "That amendment was completely meaningless, and you know it was," she said. And even though Holding brought up sexual criminals, the amendment would have changed nothing for the most egregious offenders. Undocumented immigrants who commit felonies – including serious sexual crimes like rape – were already given top priority for deportation. Ellmers referenced that in the debate: "As far as deporting those who are the worst offenders – those illegal immigrants who are pedophiles – my goodness, are we not doing that now?" It was a rhetorical question. But according to the government, we are indeed doing just that. In 2014, the Department of Homeland Security listed its highest priorities for deportation: convicted of a felony, convicted of gang-related crimes, caught at the border or suspected of being a terrorist or spy. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report on the 2015 fiscal year said 98 percent of the 235,413 people deported that year met one of its criteria or were otherwise considered a threat to public safety. At the debate, Ellmers also said she voted no because she thought Republicans should have worked with Democrats to find a compromise instead of letting President Obama set the country’s immigration policy while Congress remains in a boondoggle. "I find it interesting that we are still in a place where we are having this conversation about what we are not getting done," Ellmers said. Our ruling Holding said Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against "an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants." Holding was correct about Ellmers’ conspicuous break from party ranks. But his description of the amendment was a bit misleading, since anyone convicted of a felony for a sex crime was already prioritized for deportation. Ellmers has also long said she voted against the bill due to fears that it would lead to less reporting of domestic violence. That’s a key piece of context that was missing from Holding’s assessment of her record.

pomt-14792	The number of people in Atlanta dying from HIV and AIDS declined 59 percent between 2004 and 2012.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/dec/02/fulton-county-health-and-wellness/health-officials-right-about-drop-aids-related-dea/	Just before commemorating World AIDS Day on Tuesday, Fulton County’s health department released some rare good news on its efforts against the disease. Citing a report from an independent program of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the press release said the number of people dying here from HIV-related diseases plunged 59 percent between 2004 and 2012. "Fewer people are dying from HIV/AIDS in metro Atlanta, in part, due to our Integrated Care Service Delivery of services," Dr. David Holland, chief clinical officer of Fulton’s Communicable Disease Prevention Branch, said in the release. Could this be the same department that had to give back between $7 and 8.7 million of $20 million in federal grant money because it didn’t have enough programs to help stop the spread of HIV? And are deaths declining even though at least a quarter of all new HIV diagnoses in Atlanta are for people who have already developed AIDS? PolitiFact Georgia was skeptical. The numbers The 27th anniversary of World AIDS Day comes at a time when both the rate of HIV infection and AIDS-related deaths are on a global decline. Effective antiretroviral drugs can control HIV and help those with the disease live longer lives. As of June, 15.8 million people were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Worldwide, that has pushed down new HIV infections, which have fallen by 35 percent since 2000, and deaths, which have fallen 42 percent since a peak in 2004. The 2015 report from NACCHO’s Big Cities Health Coalition examines health data from the nation’s 27 largest cities and counties, including a look at more local HIV and AIDS figures. According to the Big Cities Health Inventory report, released in late November, cities experienced new cases of HIV and HIV-related deaths in higher numbers compared with the rest of the country. But Atlanta (as reported by Fulton County’s health department) and every other city except Detroit saw drops, some significant, in mortality rates since the last report. Atlanta had the fourth highest mortality rate of the cities, with 24.1 deaths per 100,000 people in 2004, according to the report. In 2012, the last year data was available for a majority of the cities, the rate was 9.8 – a 59 percent drop just as Fulton touted in the press release. Data from Georgia’s Department of Public Health back up those figures on the mortality rate and also provide the specific numbers of deaths. The number of people dying annually from HIV/AIDS in Fulton County dropped from 195 to 96 in those eight years, a 51 percent decline. Further bolstering Fulton’s claim are figures showing continued drops in deaths for the past two years. By 2014, 80 people in Fulton had died from HIV or AIDS, a rate of 8 percent. That’s a 59 percent decline by number or a 66.8 percent decrease in rate from the peak a decade ago. Statewide, HIV/AIDS deaths also declined during this period by 47 percent said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health. The state death rate from HIV/AIDS was 7.9 per 100,000 in 2004 and 4.2 in 2012, a 47 percent drop, she said. The context All of this is to say, Fulton is on target with its figures. Missing from the press release, though, was the context that Atlanta remains in the top 5 cities for HIV-related deaths (and top 3 for new infections). And, its 10 per 100,000 mortality rate is five times greater than the national average of 2. "It’s a big improvement but obviously some big improvements still need to be made," said Chrissie Juliano, director of the Big Cities Health Coalition. "We know from other sources that challenges remain in Atlanta-Fulton County regarding HIV and AIDS." Fulton is making headway. It completed an internal audit in October that found mismanagement and bureaucratic delays cost it the nearly $9 million in federal money to fight HIV. It has since replaced the health department director and strengthened oversight of its grants. Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health, cautioned against reading too much into Atlanta’s ranking in comparison to national mortality rates. He added that it would not be "informative" to directly compare Atlanta, or any city, to the overall U.S. rates on HIV mortality. "HIV-related deaths are much higher in cities, because people living with HIV are more concentrated in cities," Sullivan said. "The high HIV-related mortality rate reflects the high impact of HIV in Atlanta." Our ruling At a time when new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths are down globally, Fulton County touted a report that showed its mortality rate dropped 59 percent from a peak in 2004. The report, and state data, back up the dramatic decline. While Atlanta remains in the top five cities in the nation for such deaths and still struggles with executing prevention programs, it also has seen the mortality rate drop since the report.

Because of some of these factors and others, some say the U.S. Secret Service has handled more death threats against President Barack Obama than anyone who’s sat in the Oval Office. "The incidents of threats against (Obama) are greater than for any other president in modern times," civil rights legend Julian Bond recently said on "The Colbert Report." PolitiFact Georgia received a request from a reader on Twitter to examine the accuracy of such claims. We tried to reach Bond, but our efforts were unsuccessful. We tried him through the American Program Bureau, a company that has arranged interviews and speeches for Bond. We emailed Bond at American University, where he is an adjunct professor in the School of Public Affairs. We called the university’s communications department, which said it would try to contact Bond for us. Bond, 73, is the former chairman of the NAACP and a founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He is a former Atlanta resident and member of the Georgia House of Representatives. Bond has taught college courses and was the narrator of the award-winning "Eyes on the Prize" television series about the civil rights movement. Others have made similar claims about threats to Obama. And they seem to come from a single source. A U.S. Secret Service spokesman told us the agency does not discuss the number of threats against any president. But the most recent director left some bread crumbs that we followed. In August 2009, an author who’s written about the Secret Service estimated that the number of threats against Obama had increased by 400 percent in comparison with his White House predecessor, George W. Bush. But that December, then-Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan told a congressional committee that the number of threats against Obama had not -- again, had not -- increased by 400 percent. "The threats right now ... is the same level as it has been for the previous two presidents at this point in their administrations," Sullivan said. He told the committee he’d discuss specifics in private. The Secret Service doesn’t like to discuss threats against a president because it doesn’t want copycats to get any ideas. Sullivan told U.S. News during an interview in March 2010 that the threat level had not increased since Obama became president. Sullivan retired last month. In 2012, some news outlets reported that there had been a spike in threats against Obama. One report from WLS-TV, an ABC affiliate in Chicago, used the 400 percent increase figure that Sullivan had said was inaccurate. The station later added that it is believed that Obama is the most threatened president in U.S. history. But the report cited no sources. PolitiFact has occasionally dealt with claims in which the federal government cannot discuss specifics. For example, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., claimed during the 2012 presidential campaign that GOP nominee Mitt Romney went 10 years without paying taxes. Reid said he got the information from a Romney business associate who wished to remain anonymous. Although the Internal Revenue Service can’t release Romney’s taxes without his permission, PolitiFact believed the burden of proof was on Reid since he made such a serious claim and rated it a Pants On Fire! To recap, Bond said "the incidents of threats against (Obama) are greater than for any other president in modern times." But a former Secret Service director has twice said there has not been an increase. The Secret Service is, well, secret, so they won’t discuss the number of specific threats against Obama. There’s no concrete evidence that Bond and others have produced to back up their claim. We rate Bond’s claim False.	None	Julian Bond	None	None	None	2013-03-18T06:00:00	2013-03-06	['None']

pomt-04967	"When Josh Mandel claims to have accepted three debates with Sen. Sherrod Brown, he is lying. He has accepted ZERO proposed debates."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/25/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-josh-mandel-lying-debates/	It seems a tad silly for PolitiFact Ohio to wade into a debate on debates, long a rhetorical rite of passage for dueling candidates immersed in the summer doldrums of a fall campaign. But Sen. Sherrod Brown and his re-election campaign ratcheted up the rhetoric about this time-worn tradition as it settled a debate date for the City Club of Cleveland. In the morning on July 19, Friends of Sherrod Brown announced with a tone of urgency that Brown had accepted an invitation to debate Republican challenger Josh Mandel sometime in October at the City Club. Two dates -- Oct. 1 or 8 -- were on the table, Brown’s camp said. "BREAKING: Sen. Sherrod Brown Accepts City Club Debate In Cleveland, Urges Josh Mandel To Do The Same," was the headline on the news release emailed by the campaign. Mandel’s spokesman, Travis Considine, told The Plain Dealer that same morning that Mandel had agreed to a City Club debate, just not a date. Considine also said Mandel intended to participate in debates proposed in Columbus and Zanesville. Less than two hours later the Brown campaign volleyed back with a blistering news release. The email, from the headline on down, strings together a number of claims. PolitiFact Ohio homed in on the overarching message, expressed in one of three bullet points. "When Josh Mandel claims to have accepted three debates with Sen. Sherrod Brown, he is lying. He has accepted ZERO proposed debates." Really? The Mandel campaign provided a letter dated July 16 in which City Club Executive Director James Foster thanks Mandel "for accepting our invitation to a debate." The letter said a date was to be determined, but by all accounts Oct. 3 was the early choice. On July 17, the City Club’s Carrie Miller notified representatives of both campaigns via email that officials wanted to reschedule after realizing the first presidential debate also had been set for Oct. 3. She offered the campaigns two alternate dates: Monday, Oct. 1 or Monday, Oct. 8. Brown quickly sent word that he would debate on either day. This brings us to the back-and-forth on July 19. Miller told PolitiFact Ohio that the Mandel campaign had "never indicated that they were not going to participate in a debate." Brown’s news releases, though, create quite the opposite impression. In an interview July 23, Sadie Weiner, press secretary for the Brown campaign, said that campaign officials were unaware Mandel had accepted the City Club’s original invitation. But Weiner also argued that Mandel’s campaign was out of bounds in referencing the two other proposed debates. She even pointed to a Mandel campaign Tweet that said he had "agreed to 3 debates." Weiner reasoned that it was "disingenuous" for Mandel to imply he had committed to more debates than Brown had by referencing two forums that had yet to even be penciled in on a calendar. Then again, the same could be said of the City Club debate. Mandel had agreed to one date, only to have the City Club request a new one. There was no reason to think Mandel would not reschedule. Indeed, by the afternoon of July 20, both sides had agreed to an Oct. 15 showdown. And the Brown campaign acknowledges that the Mandel camp raised the possibility of other debates through one of the debate organizers. Bottom line: There’s no evidence to dispute that Mandel was agreeable to at least three debates. Had you known none of this backstory, you might come away convinced that Mandel was shying away from the debate. You see, Mandel caught grief in February for skipping a City Club forum with five of his lesser-known GOP primary opponents. At the time he vowed to meet Brown in the fall at a City Club debate. The Brown campaign said that when Mandel claimed to have accepted three debates, he was lying, and that he has accepted "zero proposed debates." That’s clearly not accurate. The letter from the City Club dated July 16 shows that Mandel had agreed to that debate. And the Twitter posting and comments to The Plain Dealer, indicate a willingness to have two others. The Brown campaign confirms that possibility had been raised, too. It appears that the Brown campaign aimed here to cast Mandel as dishonest and scared of a debate all at once. But on the Truth-O-Meter, the campaign’s claim rates Pants on Fire.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2012-07-25T06:00:00	2012-07-19	['Josh_Mandel']
pomt-03131	The very first meal on the surface of the moon was the Holy Communion.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/16/facebook-posts/facebook-post-recognizes-little-known-space-fact/	Occasionally a claim comes across our desks here at PolitiFact Georgia that seems to touch all bases -- this one has God, politics and even men landing on the moon. The claim hinted at political ramifications and a possible government cover-up. And it was broadcast as a viral Facebook post. What more could a fact-checker ask for? So let’s go back a bit, to 1969 and man’s first landing on the moon, a feat that seemed almost magical to anyone watching and listening. "Not many people know it but on July 20, 1969, Buzz Aldrin took communion on the moon. The very first meal ever taken on the moon was the blood and body of Christ!" the Facebook post read. We had heard about astronauts partaking of freeze-dried food and dehydrated drinks. And we knew about the Apollo 8 crew on Christmas Eve 1968 reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon, an event heard by millions. But the Holy Communion claim was new to us. We decided to do some exploring of our own. The Facebook post about Aldrin led to a post on the JesusLovesYou.org website, a member of the Greater Good Network of websites. The sites promote numerous nonprofit organizations for contributions. That post references Aldrin’s comments on the experience: "I had intended to read my communion passage back to earth, but at the last minute [they] had requested that I not do this," Aldrin said. "NASA was already embroiled in a legal battle with Madelyn Murray O’Hare (sic), the celebrated opponent of religion, over the Apollo 8 crew reading from Genesis while orbiting the moon Christmas (Eve in 1968). I agreed reluctantly." So, is that why we hadn’t heard about the moon service? Did NASA, under pressure from an atheist activist, try to keep the Christian observance a secret? Our research on this claim led to several sources about the holy meal, but we wanted to hear directly from Aldrin himself. Aldrin was part of the Apollo 11 space mission that put the first people on the moon on July 20, 1969. He was the second person to walk on the moon, following fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong. The moonwalker is currently on a tour promoting his newest book, "Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration." We tracked down his tour publicist at National Geographic Books, but unfortunately,we were unable to schedule an interview by press time. Aldrin is now consulting for the U.S. government about the future of the country's space program and how to make space more accessible to everyday people The Communion event was re-enacted during Episode Six of the HBO-television miniseries "From the Earth to the Moon." The one-season, 12-episode miniseries ran in 1998. It was a dramatized portrayal of the Apollo manned space program’s expeditions to the moon. But in a Guideposts article after the 1969 mission, Aldrin confirmed that the religious meal took place inside the Eagle spacecraft once it landed on the moon. "I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup," Aldrin said. "It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements." He then recited a Bible verse, John 15:5. NASA history also mentions Aldrin’s Communion service. In his memoirs, Aldrin notes that Armstrong did not participate in the Communion service. Aldrin also expressed second thoughts about his religious observance. "Neil watched respectfully but made no comment to me at the time," Aldrin wrote. "Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind -- be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists." Aldrin initially wanted his Communion service broadcast on the air with the rest of his comments and biblical reading. But NASA decided against that idea. It was conducted during "radio silence," which means that only he and Armstrong witnessed it. There was no communication between the spacecraft and Mission Control in Houston during radio silence. Atheist activist Madalyn Murray O’Hair had already sued NASA over the 1968 Bible reading in space. O’Hair said the reading violated the legal separation of church and state. "Although O’Hair’s ideas did not represent mainstream America at that time, her lawsuit was a nuisance and a distraction that NASA preferred to live without," Aldrin wrote. (The case was eventually rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.) So during radio silence, Aldrin read his Bible verse and took his Communion. Aldrin kept his on-air comments more general. He asked for a few moments of silence "to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way." To sum up, a Facebook post claimed that NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin took Communion on the moon. Several sources, including NASA records and Aldrin’s memoirs, include accounts of the Communion service. PolitiFact also discovered that Aldrin’s church, outside of Houston, still celebrates the lunar Communion service each year on the Sunday closest to the July 20, 1969, moon landing. We rate the Facebook Communion claim True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2013-09-16T00:00:00	2013-07-20	['None']
pomt-06835	Says Texas has "the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/aug/06/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-has-lowest-capita-state-debt/	Calling himself an unapologetic fiscal conservative, Gov. Rick Perry told the New Hampshire Union Leader the state’s fiscal efficiency matters most, adding that Texas "has, I believe, the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states." Truth-O-Meter on. Some background: Last year, we rated True a claim by Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White that the state’s debt load had doubled in Perry’s then-nine-plus years as governor. According to the Texas Bond Review Board, which oversees the issuance of most state bonds, Texas had $34.08 billion in outstanding bonds and notes as of Aug. 31, 2009, the end of fiscal 2009. That figure increased 11 percent to $37.82 billion as of Aug. 31, 2010, primarily due to increased debt commitments by colleges and universities and transportation-related debt, the board’s 2010 annual report says. And how does the state’s debt boil out per resident? The report says that in 2007-08, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, Texas was home to the second-most residents among the states, but ranked ninth among the 10 most populous states in state debt per capita, at $1,369 per resident. The report says New York topped the most populous states with state per-capita debt of $5,861. Next, we asked the Census Bureau if it had more up-to-date figures. Spokeswoman Jenna Arnold pointed us to an online table listing each state’s debt in 2009. Drawing on the bureau’s 2009 population estimates for the states, we then calculated per-capita figures for the 10 most populous states that year. Texas’ per-capita state debt came out to $1,227, less than the per-capita debt of the nine other states. The other states: New York ($6,279 per capita); Illinois ($4,415); California ($3,642); Pennsylvania ($3,324); Michigan ($2,969); Ohio ($2,426); North Carolina ($2,121); Florida ($2,098); and Georgia ($1,374). Also, we peeked at a post by the Washington-based Tax Foundation listing a slightly different per-capita figure for the state’s fiscal 2009 debt level, $1,240, placing Texas 49th among the 50 states. Massachusetts, ranked No. 1, had per-capita debt of $11,357. For more perspective, we turned to the bond review board, whose executive director, Robert Kline, passed along a May 25, 2011, report by Moody’s Investors Service, which provides credit ratings and research covering debt instruments and securities. The report covers state debt levels in 2010, stating: "Two measures of state debt burden — debt per capita and debt as a percentage of personal income — are commonly used by analysts to compare the debt burden of one state to another. Debt burden is one of many factors that Moody’s uses to determine state credit quality. In considering debt burden, the focus is largely on net tax-supported debt, which Moody’s characterizes as debt secured by state resources." And Texas ranked 39th among the states, at $612 per capita, in net tax-supported debt, the report says. The national average for states was $1,404. The states with less debt than Texas were all less populous: Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Montana, Arkansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa and Nebraska, which is listed as having the least per-capita net tax-supported debt among the states at $13. We noticed the Moody’s per-capita figures were smaller than those reached using the census data. That’s because the census bureau’s state debt totals wrap in more kinds of debt--for example, tuition revenue bonds issued on behalf of institutions of higher education. The bureau defines its debt tally as "long-term credit obligations of the government and its agencies whether backed by the governments' full faith and credit or non-guaranteed." By email, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the governor, speaking off the top of his head in the newspaper interview, had based his debt claims on Moody’s information. "Texas does have the lowest debt per capita of the top 10 most populous states," Frazier said. Frazier said Perry’s other claim, about Texas having the fourth-lowest debt per capita among the states, ties to Moody’s calculation of each state’s ratio of debt to gross state product. By that measure, she said, Texas is sixth lowest among the states. Indeed, the Moody’s report says Texas has a ratio of 1.66 percent, lower than ratios for every state except Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. The national average is nearly 4.5 percent. The report says the ratio is useful for comparing different states and countries. In an interview, Moody’s analyst Nicole Johnson said that a relatively low ratio generally means a state has more flexibility to increase its debt than states with high ratios. So, Texas has the least state debt per capita among the most populous states, as Perry says, and by Moody’s accounting the 12th lowest of all states. Perry incorrectly said it was fourth-lowest of all states, but his meaning holds up; Texas is a relatively low-debt state. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-06793	"Credit agency says Rep. Gibbs recklessly caused downgrade, higher interest rates."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/15/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-say-republican-rep-bob-gibbs-caused-down/	After Standard and Poor's decision to lower the credit rating of the United States government from AAA status to AA-plus, Democrats and Republicans jumped into the blame game with equal vigor. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives, pointed the finger at Rep. Bob Gibbs, a Republican from the 18th District in east-central Ohio. The DCCC issued a statement headlined, "Credit agency says Rep. Gibbs recklessly caused downgrade, higher interest rates." It said that "the downgrade of America’s credit rating and the expected higher interest rates that come with it are thanks to Rep. Bob Gibbs recklessly protecting tax breaks for multi-millionaires and tax subsidies for Big Oil." PolitiFact used the same source to evaluate this claim as we used to rule on a similar claim from Republicans: the S&P report, which is available to anyone online. S&P based its downgrade on politics more than finance. It faulted "the political brinksmanship of recent months," complained that the statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default "have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy" and said that "the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge." The report criticized both major political parties, but it did not apportion blame or indicate which party might bear more responsibility. It did not assign value to specific spending or tax votes, beyond indicating that new revenues might have helped head off a downgrade, and it did not name individuals. The DCCC cited half a dozen sources to back up its assertion that "the Gibbs-Boehner downgrade of American credit could raise interest rates for consumers." All of those sources were articles that speculated on the possibility of interest rates increasing, and all of them came before the Federal Reserve made its promise to hold short-term interest rates near zero for at least the next two years. In fact, some consumer interest rates could increase in the future, but rates so far have not increased on one indicator, offers for new credit cards. Regardless, we stumble over the DCCC's line that Gibbs can be blamed individually for the downgrade and any of its potential consequences, and over the way it gives the freshman legislator equal billing with Speaker of the House John Boehner. PolitiFact Ohio rated the similar GOP claim Mostly False, noting that it blamed Democrats for the downgrade, a claim that contains an element of truth because S&P held both parties responsible. The DCCC’s statement specifically claims that S&P blamed Gibbs for "recklessly" causing the downgrade and raising interest rates. That simply is not accurate, which on the Truth-O-Meter makes it False.	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2011-08-15T11:30:00	2011-08-10	['None']
pomt-11901	"Tulsa school closes after brutal fire."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/23/react365com/user-generated-prank-post-falsely-says-tulsa-high-/	A bogus Internet post that said a Tulsa high school was closed after an arsonist torched the building is from a website that allows users to generate fake news stories. "Tulsa School closes after brutal fire," read the headline on a React365.com post we first saw on Oct. 23, 2017. Facebook users reported the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site's efforts to curb fake news. The post was only five (grammatically improper) sentences long, and featured a photo that turned up first in a Google image search of the city’s East Central High School: "Tulsa school East Central High School closes down after fire set on purpose. Tulsa firefighters say that someone broke in the school threw the east wing door. The say the fire was set from inside the building on the first floor. The school will remain closed until Further notice.The Students will be attending Nathan Hale High School." But there was no fire and East Central High School is not closed, nor will Nathan Hale High School be getting an influx of displaced students. The post is fake, as are all the stories featured on React365.com. The website allows people to create "prank" stories, in which users write a few sentences and post a photo to trick people. The stories have the same effect as any fake news article — they trick readers into thinking they are real. Out of context, anyone can be fooled, even with the minimal warning posted at the bottom of the page that reads, "This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users. These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information." React365.com is one of a number of URLs owned by a man named Nicolas Gouriou, who runs a company in Binic, France, called Mediavibes. When we tried to contact Mediavibes via email, they only replied that they do not comment to the press. Readers should be wary of any story from React365.com or similar sites. The posts appear to always carry the current date, and feature a share counter that reflects the current date. When we saw the story on Oct. 23, the counter said the story was from that day and had been shared more than 22,000 times, but there’s no way to tell if that’s accurate. The Tulsa School of Arts and Sciences charter high school was ravaged by an accidental fire shortly after opening in 2012, forcing students into the former Sequoyah Elementary School building.

pomt-13900	On eliminating the influence of money in policy campaigns	full flop	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jun/28/jim-kenney/the-dark-money-that-helped-pass-soda-tax/	Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney made it clear during his candidacy that he was against the use of dark money in politics. But his months-long campaign to make Philadelphia the first major U.S. city with a soda tax benefitted from just that. In 2015, when Kenney was running for mayor, he threw support behind a bill in City Council that aimed to remove dark money from elections. "I support Council President Clarke’s bill," he said of the measure, according to the Philadelphia Tribune. "And, as mayor, I will fight to eliminate the influence of money in campaigning and governance." Which brings us to Monday, when Philadelphia Magazine revealed that a pro-soda-tax nonprofit, which paid for a television ad campaign, was funded with dark money. Philadelphia law does not place the same limits on policy campaigns as elections. Lobbyists backing legislative actions only have to report donors who give more than a tenth of their cash overall. Reporting these larger contributions is required not on a frequent basis, but a quarterly one. Philadelphians for a Fair Future is a coalition that counts a deep list of local nonprofits, advocacy groups, unions and community organizations as members. Aside from the rallying that came from within its ranks and the commercials, the group also backed polls. Kenney absolutely supported the efforts of Philadelphians for a Fair Future. At the press conference announcing their formation, he introduced them. "It's going to be an air war. It's going to be a ground war, and there are going to be lobbyists out the wazoo, all right? And they're going to be making big money doing it," he said, according to Newsworks. "These," Kenney said of the nonprofit, "are my lobbyists." Committee of 70 president David Thornburgh said addressing the lack of transparency should trump placing limits on civic campaign contributions. "In a perfect world, those contributions and/or expenditures would be required to be reported in as near to real time as possible," he said. "The technology doesn’t stand in the way. We could literally do this same day if we wanted to. That’s the best antidote to the sense that there’s something fishy going on here." Michael Bloomberg, the largest donor according to Philadelphia Magazine, gave roughly $1.5 million to Philadelphians for a Fair Future. Without a full public accounting, there’s no way to know how much funding the nonprofit received from donors like that. Kevin Feeley, a spokesman for Philadelphians for a Fair Future told PolitiFact PA the nonprofit will disclose "all of its donors" with the next filing, due July 30. This means the coalition would be reporting more than it is legally required to. Dark money was a topic of conversation during the lead-up to the mayoral primary last year, especially after candidate Lynne Abraham called on her fellow candidates to reject such funding. Kenney told Newsworks, "We don't have the capacity to ban 'dark money.' It's the United States Supreme Court that said they're allowed to do it, and they're doing it. "If you can get me some idea of how I can stop them from doing it other than turning off everyone's televisions, I don't know what it is I can do. Am I glad it exists? No. But it exists, and I didn't create the situation. I assume I'm going to see something negative about me that I won't like coming from one of those [independent expenditure groups]. But, that's life until the Supreme Court changes a ruling." Philadelphians for a Fair Future is not able to submit additional filings between the quarterly schedule as updates. The group is able to share the names of donors as it pleases for public reading. According to Feeley, no such plan exists. The current lobbying law was the city’s first ever; it passed in 2010. It would take another City Council ordinance to lower the 10-percent threshold, and require lobbying to report more donors contributions. Kenney has yet to support such reforms publicly. "Of course, not everything can be done in the administration’s first six months, so we anticipate future action on campaign finance reforms in the months and years to come," Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said in an email. "The mayor is open to reforms related to lobbying, campaign finance or regulations specific to the use of 501(c)4s in policy pushes like the soda tax," she later clarified. Our Ruling Kenney told the Philadelphia Tribune, "As mayor, I will fight to eliminate the influence of money in campaigning and governance." In regards to reforming the current city lobbying law, he hasn’t "fought" to tighten it. Philadelphians for a Fair Future’s pro-soda tax efforts were well-funded civic campaigns that did not come out of the mayor’s office. He did call them his lobbyists however. Kenney did not distance himself from the group that, so far, has not shared its full donor list. A concern on current reporting requirements is not solely on their totality, but on their frequency. We cannot expect to know all the donors until a month from now. Kenney did not push for lobbying law reform during the soda tax debate, and he isn’t at present. We rate Kenney’s promise on eliminating dark money in politics a Full Flop.	None	Jim Kenney	None	None	None	2016-06-28T14:56:36	2015-04-25	['None']
pomt-02507	On repealing the 17th Amendment	full flop	/texas/statements/2014/feb/13/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-went-you-betcha-kemosabe-i-would-no/	"Flip flop," begins a Jan. 22, 2014, news blog entry from the San Antonio Express-News. "That’s exactly what Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and state Sen. Dan Patrick, both trying to capture the tea party vote in the Republican primary, did earlier this week when posed a question about repealing the 17th Amendment." The 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1913, did away with state legislatures electing U.S. senators and handed that power directly to the people. It begins, "The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote." At the time, the 17th Amendment was seen as a move away from corruption and toward purer democracy, according to an Oct. 10, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news blog post and an Oct. 16, 2013 Statesman news story. But tea party activists, particularly in Texas, describe it as a mistake that reduced state power by undoing an intended balance between U.S. representatives elected locally by the people and U.S. senators more accountable to state legislators. Another Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, Texas land commissioner Jerry Patterson, said in a Waco Tribune-Herald interview published Feb. 2 and in subsequent emails to us that Patrick and Dewhurst each said in an Oct. 3 debate that he favored repeal, then changed his tune at a Jan. 20 King Street Patriots debate. Patterson and another GOP candidate, Texas agriculture commissioner Todd Staples, who weren’t asked about repeal at the October debate, each said at the later debate that he opposes repealing the amendment, according to a YouTube video that King Street spokesman Logan Churchwell told us by phone accurately presented the candidates’ responses. To gauge whether Dewhurst and Patrick flip-flopped, we reviewed the cited debates, checked news accounts and reached out to their respective campaigns. (Our check of Patrick’s statements is here.) When a Statesman reporter asked Oct. 8 whether Dewhurst supported the amendment’s repeal, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine replied by email, "That is accurate." His response included Dewhurst’s comment at the Oct. 3 debate held in Houston by the Clear Lake Tea Party, plus web links to news and social media accounts of Cruz, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and prominent Republicans around the country saying they favored repeal. Rauf wrote in an Oct. 16 Express-News news story: Asked by Patrick at a Houston-area debate if he supports repealing the amendment, Dewhurst pounced. "You betcha, Kemosabe," he replied. "Right now, many members of Congress, United States senators and United States congressmen, don't have a feeling for what the states need." According to the Oct. 10 Statesman news blog post, Dewhurst went on to say: "Believe me, with the absence -- a reversal of the 17th Amendment -- would make all of our United States senators listening daily to the heartbeat of the legislatures and not be passing the laws that cost all of us. Which affect your freedoms and cost you tax dollars that you should never reach into your pocket to pay." At the Jan. 20 King Street debate in Houston, according to the YouTube video, Dewhurst said, "I would not be in favor of repealing the 17th Amendment if for no other reason than pure practicality. It’s not going to happen." We reached out to the Dewhurst campaign about his conflicting answers and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Between the October and January debates, Dewhurst shifted his declared position on repealing the amendment from "You betcha, Kemosabe" to "I would not be in favor of repealing the 17th Amendment." We judge that a Full Flop. FULL FLOP-- A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop.

pomt-09600	Chile ranks third internationally in economic freedom, while the U.S. ranks 17th.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/19/glenn-beck/beck-says-chile-easily-tops-us-economic-freedom-ra/	Chile, an eager adapter of free-market principles in Latin America, has long been a favorite of economic conservatives. Recently, a decision by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- the club of rich nations -- to invite Chile to become a member has become, for many on the right, symbolic of how adhering to free-market principles can vault former Third World countries into economic affluence. In a video blog post dated Jan. 15, 2010, conservative TV and radio host Glenn Beck championed Chile as a nation no longer "struggling with poverty," having overcome a reputation for corruption and bureaucracy through such policies as freer labor markets and lower taxes. In addition to citing the OECD invitation, Beck pointed to its high standing in recent international ratings of "economic freedom." "They ranked 71st of 72 in 1975 in a study of economic freedom in the world," Beck said in his video blog post. "Now, in that same study, they rank third. The U.S. is ranked 17th." We wondered whether Chile is really that far ahead of the U.S. in "economic freedom," so we looked at the data. We located an editorial in Investor's Business Daily -- a leading voice for free-market capitalism -- that appears to be the source of Beck's statistic. The editorial, published Dec. 4, 2009, was later picked up by a smattering of conservative bloggers on its way to Beck's desk. The editorial said in part, "In the Cato Institute's 1975 Economic Freedom of the World Report, [Chile] ranked a wretched 71 out of 72 countries evaluated. Today it's a different country altogether. Embracing markets has made it one of the most open economies in the world, ranking third on Cato's index, just behind Hong Kong and Singapore." Later on, the editorial added that the United States "ranks just 17th on Cato's 2009 Index of Economic Freedom." However, if you look at the 2009 Economic Freedom of the World study by Cato -- a libertarian think tank in Washington -- the numbers were actually different. Hong Kong and Singapore did indeed rank 1 and 2, respectively, but then came New Zealand and Switzerland before Chile at No. 5. In the No. 6 spot, behind by a fraction of a point, was the United States. So while it's true that, by Cato's reckoning, Chile ranked ahead of the United States, it was less of a blowout than Beck or IBD indicated. We also looked at the two prior years' Cato studies to make sure that Beck wasn't simply off by a year. That wasn't the case. In the 2008 study, Chile ranked No. 6 with the United States at 8, in a two-way tie with Australia and once again behind by a fraction of a point. And in the 2007 study, the United States actually ranked higher than Chile. The United States was tied for fifth while Chile was tied for 11th. One of the co-authors of Cato's 2009 study -- Joshua Hall, a Beloit College economist -- also confirmed to PolitiFact that the United States has never ranked as low as 17th in all the years that study has been conducted. Another co-author, James Gwartney, a Florida State University economist, confirmed that Beck was correct in saying that Chile ranked 71st out of 72 countries in 1975. In the meantime, we also looked at whether Beck (or IBD) had mistaken the Cato study for a different report. As it happens, there are at least three other studies that attempt to rank the nations of the world based on "economic freedom" or a similar yardstick. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, publishes an annual Index of Economic Freedom. In 2009, the United States ranked sixth in its study while Chile ranked 11th. The World Economic Forum, a Geneva-based international organization, publishes an annual Global Competitiveness Index. Its 2009-10 ratings peg the United States at No. 2 and Chile at 30. Finally, the World Bank publishes an annual "Doing Business" ranking that seeks to measure which countries have a regulatory environment "conducive to the operation of business." In this tally, the United States finished fourth overall with Chile 49th. Given these ratings, it would seem unlikley that Beck or IBD could have accidentally been referring to any of these studies. However, we would be remiss if we failed to add that, despite the apparent flub on reporting the rankings, Beck's overall assessment of Chile's recent economic history is largely accurate. We spoke with three experts on Latin American economics and politics who work with centrist-to-liberal think tanks -- Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations, Andres Martinez of the New America Foundation and Leonardo Martinez-Diaz of the Brookings Institution -- and they agreed that there is a broad ideological consensus on Beck's two key points: Namely, Chile has improved its economic position in recent years and that free-market policies can take some of the credit. "If trends continue, Chile will soon be considered one of those rare countries that has graduated out of the developing world, according to plenty of living-standard indices," Andres Martinez said. "The country is also the poster child for those who believe globalization and free trade can lift living standards, as Chile's economic course has long been anchored in its free-trade agreement with the U.S. and its dynamic export sector. It also stands out among South American countries in that its governing socialists have pragmatically been the ones embracing this pro-business, market-oriented economy." So while there is some truth to Beck's underlying point that Chile has improved its economic freedom, he's wrong to portray Chile as ranking far ahead of the United States. By several measures, the United States ranks significantly higher than Chile; in one, Chile is slightly ahead. So we find his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01479	Based on current trends, "15.5 million girls will be married in the next 16 years as children."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/29/emma-watson/watson-155-million-women-will-marry-children/	Every year around the world, millions of girls under the age of 18 get married, often without having any say in the decision. While this isn’t a bad deal in every instance, the statistics raise many red flags. In too many cases, the move comes at the price of a girl’s health, education and personal safety. The issue shows up in many pleas to improve the lot of women worldwide and was part of an impassioned speech at the United Nations by Harry Potter actress Emma Watson. Watson, who carries the title Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women, noted in a Sept 20 speech that if nothing is done, "15.5 million girls will be married in the next 16 years as children." As we began checking that statement, we quickly figured out that Watson's wording was garbled. The correct expression would have been 15.5 million girls per year, and that would be starting in the year 2030, 16 years from now. A senior adviser at UN Women acknowledged the mistake. The upshot: Watson’s figure is a huge undercount. From an article cited by UN Women, more than 140 million women under 18 will get married by 2020. The primary source behind these figures is the UN Population Fund, which in turn relies on data from the Demographic and Health Survey and the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey. These provide generally reliable information, and analysts at the Population Fund culled numbers from 48 developing nations on women between the ages of 20 and 24. Essentially, to measure how many females married young, you survey those who are 20 or older and ask them when they got married. By convention, anyone who marries under the age of 18 is considered to have wedded early. According to the Population Fund, in 2010, 14.2 million girls under 18 married each year. By 2030, they projected the rate would rise to 15.1 million per year. Why the annual increase? Sylvia Wong specializes in adolescent issues at the Population Fund. Wong said there’s a demographic bubble moving through the system. "Many of these countries have extremely young populations with larger cohorts of younger girls, who have not yet married but may be at risk in the next 16 years," Wong said. Demographer Margaret Greene, author of a Ford Foundation report on gaps in the research on child marriage, said these figures are "on target," but notes that the underlying picture is changing. "Individual country studies conducted in the past couple of years show increases in (the) age at marriage, say from 14 to 16," Greene said. "But since these ages are both under 18, you don't see many shifts in the overall percentage of child marriages." In fact, while the demographics might lead to a rise in the annual overall number, underage marriage actually is falling when you compare it to the total population of young women in each country. Using the same data as the Population Fund, two World Bank researchers noted in a 2012 article that "it is widely acknowledged that child marriage is decreasing." They wrote that the incidence of child marriage in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa has gone down by about 20 percent in the past 30 years. The rate used to be over 50 percent. Today it is down to about 40 percent. They said "progress has been made," but the gains have been slow. In this fact-check, our main goal is to examine how closely Watson’s statement tracks with current research. No one can say for sure what the rate of early marriage will be 16 years from now. Gayatri Koolwal is a development economist with Data 2X, a UN project aimed at improving the quality of data related to women. Koolwal said the underlying data is valid but urged a bit of caution. "These projections over a long period of time are always tricky," Koolwal said. "They don't account for a host of other factors, including economic, political, and health-related, that could affect demographic trends over the same period." Our ruling Watson said that at current rates, 15.5 million girls would be married as children in the next 16 years. Watson probably meant to say that 16 years from now, 15.5 million girls per year would be married as children. However, the estimate we found from the source cited by UN Women is a bit less than Watson said -- 15.1 rather than 15.5 million by 2030. The annual number masks two underlying trends. First, in some developing countries, the age of marriage is rising even if it remains below the threshold age of 18. Second and more important, the incidence of child marriage is falling. It just isn’t falling as quickly as the population of young girls is increasing. Watson severely undercounts the sheer number of young marriages that will take place between now and 2030. Based on current trends, there would be not just another 15 million, but another 125 million on top of that, a figure that would have bolstered her case. But either way, the statistic ignores that the incidence of child marriage is falling. On balance, Watson's claim is partly accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-14034	Says Maggie Hassan was "out of state on 30 days over the last three months."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/may/27/kelly-ayotte/how-much-has-maggie-hassan-been-out-new-hampshire-/	There’s been a common question from Republicans in New Hampshire’s biggest political race lately. "Where’s Maggie Hassan?" Hassan, the Democratic governor, in case anyone missed it, is running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte’s campaign, like the state’s Republican party, is keen on cataloguing Hassan’s time away from the state as she attends party meetings and fundraisers. In a press release this month titled "Hassan Claims Her Job is 'Always' Her Top Priority, But She’s Increasingly Absent," the Ayotte camp made its case crystal clear. "If Governor Hassan’s first priority is ‘always’ her job as governor, she wouldn’t have been out of state on 30 days over the last three months," spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in the release. Could Hassan have possibly spent an entire month outside of the state from February through April? We decided to check it out. What to check First off, we should note that Ayotte’s campaign originally focused on Hassan’s travel in April alone, based on reporting by the New Hampshire Union Leader. That paper’s reporter Dan Tuohy wrote about the governor’s schedule that month, which included 12 days "out of New Hampshire" for political travel. Ayotte’s office cited an earlier version of that article in a May 3 press release, claiming that Hassan spent half of April outside of New Hampshire. But based on Hassan’s schedule, at a maximum she was out of the state 40 percent of the time, which isn’t "half." The senator’s campaign soon broadened its criticism to three months, so that’s what we’re focusing on here. Hassan’s campaign regularly discloses the number of days that the governor travels out of state for political purposes. On March 1, it sent a letter to the state Republican party detailing her 10 days of out-of-state political travel from February. On April 1, it sent a letter outlining her eight days of out-of-state political travel that month. And on May 2, it sent a letter noting that Hassan had been outside the state for political reasons 12 days in April. Add up the days, and you have 30 days of travel over three months. Case closed, right? Ayotte’s re-election effort wants to paint the governor as an absentee leader, routinely leaving a state in need of leadership, including a day in May when two police officers were shot . A WMUR report this month lays out their case. The state GOP’s Twitter account routinely presses the charge, too. We checked with both campaigns to see what was behind those numbers. Day-by-day The Hassan campaign’s letters to the state GOP detail her travels. With four exceptions (Philadelphia on Feb. 2, Chicago on Feb. 29, Austin on April 21 and Rhode Island on April 29) she visited three general areas -- New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Massachusetts. It’s easy to see why those three would be crucial for this candidate / governor -- and on five of the days in question Hassan attended the National Governors Association Winter Meeting in D.C. What’s important to note about these travel days is that about half -- 16 of the 30 -- came during days that Hassan had no events scheduled in New Hampshire. For the 14 other days of travel, Hassan spent at least some of her time here. That’s according to her public schedules for the three months, which were made available to PolitiFact New Hampshire by her campaign. The governor’s schedule during these 14 days varied. On April 6, she had a breakfast event at 8 a.m. followed by an Executive Council meeting at 10 a.m. in New Hampshire. She headed to Massachusetts later. Likewise, on April 14, a day of travel in Massachusetts included events in Concord, N.H. (1 p.m.), Londonderry (2 p.m.) and Manchester (4 p.m.). On other travel days, however, the governor only fit in a morning event before hitting the road. That was the case on Feb. 28 and March 2, among others. Doing the math This extra information allows us to crunch Hassan’s travel numbers in different ways. In the simplest terms, Hassan was traveling out of New Hampshire 33 percent of the time from February through April. Her five days at the national governors meeting could be excluded if all she did during that span was attend the conference. (The nonpartisan group includes the heads of all 50 states and discusses policy). However, she also attended separate gatherings with fellow Democratic governors, which is why her campaign included the trip as political travel. Deducting those days gives you a 28 percent absentee rate. Counting only the days that the governor traveled out of state and had no public events in New Hampshire, she was gone 18 percent percent of the time. Geographically, 19 of the 30 trip days were outside of New England -- meaning that Hassan was outside the region only 21 percent of the time. Simple enough, perhaps. But we haven’t exhausted ways of crunching these numbers. Why don’t we simply look at a calendar? While no one would dispute that a governor’s job never stops, most of New Hampshire’s legislative business is conducted during ordinary business hours, during an ordinary business week. So if you take weekend days out of the equation, we have a slightly different picture. Looking only at the 65 total weekdays from February through April, Hassan traveled outside the state on 23 of them.That means she was at least partially on the road for 35 percent of ordinary weekdays for these three months. That’s more than a third of the time. Our ruling U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte’s campaign said earlier this month that Gov. Maggie Hassan was "out of state on 30 days over the last three months." Hassan was traveling out of state for political reasons on 30 days of the 90 in February, March and April, but spent a portion of those days in the state as well. If you exclude the days that she also had events in the state, she was absent only 18 percent of the time. There are a multitude of ways to interpret this data about Hassan, and Ayotte’s campaign is certainly taking the least charitable view possible. But it’s also a justifiable one, albeit needing clarification. We rate Ayotte’s claim Mostly True.	None	Kelly Ayotte	None	None	None	2016-05-27T18:19:30	2016-05-18	['None']

pomt-11961	Says that under the Obamacare law, health insurance "premiums have increased by more than 105 percent since" 2013.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/oct/04/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-obamacare-premiums-more-doubled-f/	John Cornyn of Texas accurately told a Texas constituent that residents of a third of U.S. counties are down to a single choice of insurance plans under the Obamacare law that Republicans vow to repeal. PolitiFact this year rated True a similar claim. According to a 2016 analysis, people trying to purchase insurance on a government exchange only had one provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation’s counties. Some 21 percent of Affordable Care Act enrollees, or about 1.9 million people, could pick from a single insurance provider. But a Houston resident asked us to check another part of Cornyn’s September 2017 email to her, in which he said: "Under the Affordable Care Act (P. L. 111-148), premiums have increased by more than 105 percent since" 2013. We decided to put that declared increase to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. This claim, we found, stems from a reputable report, though the percentage cited by Cornyn merits explanatory clarifications. Cornyn cites HHS report At our inquiry, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie traced the 105-percent figure to a five-page May 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stating that average premiums charged in 2017 for health insurance policies sold to individuals shopping for coverage on the online federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, were 105 percent higher "than average individual market premiums in 2013." The report further says: "The median state percent increase was 108%. The results are similar with those published by online health insurance broker eHealth, which found a 99% increase in premiums for plans purchased on their portal between 2013 and 2017." See the undated eHealth state-by-state chart here. Nationally, the HHS report says, average "monthly premiums increased from $232 in 2013 to $476 in 2017 and 62% of those states had 2017 exchange premiums at least double the 2013 average." A chart in the report shows variations by state ranging from a low of 12 percent (New Jersey) to a high of 222 percent (Alabama). For Texas, the 2017 average premium for individual coverage purchased through the exchange, $404, was costing 82 percent more than the $222 market average price in the state in 2013 for an individual policy, the chart says. Report comes with conditions Experts we reached agreed premiums in 2017 were up quite a bit from 2013. They also noted contrasts to take into consideration. Michael Tanner, who studies health care reform for the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, called HHS’s reported percentage and other escalation estimates "in the ballpark." By phone, Tanner went on: "To try to pin it down to an exact percentage, that’s why we don’t (calculate) those numbers." The Cornyn-cited HHS report itself offers clarifications, including: --A reminder that the Obamacare law imposed coverage expectations not fully in place until 2014. "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced many new regulations in the market for individual health insurance," the report says. "These included a number of changes to the types of insurance products that could be offered and the rules insurers could use to vary prices based on customer risk," a reference to the Obamacare law’s mandate that insurers cover pre-existing conditions without imposing additional purchaser costs. "In most states," the report says, "these regulations increased insurance coverage requirements and would be expected, on average, to increase the price of ACA-compliant plans relative to pre-ACA plans all else equal." --"This analysis," the report says, "does not account for the fact that the overall populations enrolling in the individual market in 2017 are different from those enrolling in 2013. Older and less healthy people are a larger share of the individual market risk pool now than in 2013. The changing mix of enrollees and adverse selection pressure has likely been a significant cause of the large average premium increases in the individual market over this four-year period," the report says. --The research didn’t consider premium changes in states including California and New York that set up their own online exchanges. "To the extent that trends are different in state-based exchanges," the report says, "the national average increase may differ" from the report’s results. --The report did not reach to checking premium changes on individual policies purchased privately, not through exchanges. In 2016, the report says, an HHS office estimated that the non-exchange individual market equaled 38 percent of total individual market enrollment. News accounts on the report similarly noted caveats. Prior to Obamacare, The Washington Post pointed out, insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing illnesses and states varied the types of coverage insurers could offer. "At the time," the newspaper said, "health insurance could be sold with fewer medical benefits. This allowed for lower premiums for healthier people, but it also put coverage out of reach for millions of others." A New York Times story on the report said "the plans and the insurance pools of 2013 are not the same as those of 2017. Some plans may have been cheaper in 2013, but covered so little that they would now fail to meet the Congressional Budget Office’s definition of insurance." Most significantly, the Times reported, the HHS "report compares two fundamentally different universes of plans: those in the entire individual market in 2013 and those only in the federal exchange in 2017." News reports also noted that the Obamacare law provides tax-credit subsidies to many insurance purchasers, driving down what they pay out of pocket--a point acknowledged in a report footnote. The Post’s story said: "But middle-class individuals and families, who make more than $48,240 or ​$98,400, respectively, often take on the full increases." Meantime, the Fact Checker at the Post provided additional perspective by noting the number of people directly affected by Obamacare premium increases breaks out to one-fourteenth the size of the employment-based health-insurance market. Experts suggest other considerations Tanner and Craig Palosky of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care, each noted a way to gauge changes in premiums since the Obamacare law took full effect is to look at changes in premiums for the benchmark "silver" health plan, the second-lowest-cost insurance offering sold on exchanges. Kaiser’s June 2017 analysis, taking into account plans available in each state to a 40-year-old, shows the 2017 average benchmark silver U.S. premium of $371 up 32 percent from $271 in 2014, the earliest year of comparison. In Texas, per the analysis, the 2017 average benchmark silver premium of $319 was up 29 percent from $248 in 2014. By email, Brandewie of Cornyn’s staff said we were venturing into an apples-to-oranges comparison in that Cornyn’s claim focused on all plans sold on exchanges in 39 states and started a year earlier. To our inquiry, Gail Wilensky, an economist who oversaw Medicaid and Medicare during President George H.W. Bush’s administration, said by phone that "the ultimate qualification is you don’t know what would have happened to the premiums for this particular group in the absence of the Affordable Care Act. Having said that, we, of course, know the premiums have gone up a lot." Experts conceded that under the Obamacare law, tax credits have eased what 80-plus percent of purchasers on the exchanges pay for coverage. Regardless, Wilensky and Tanner each said, that doesn’t make the premium increases less real; taxpayers pick up the costs of tax credits. Like Wilensky, Timothy Callaghan, a Texas A&M University expert on health policy, said a driver behind the difference in premiums is that insurance companies initially "incorrectly priced their plans during the first year of exchange operations" by expecting many more younger healthier adults to sign up in contrast to older individuals more likely to be ill--and then they had to adjust. Callaghan further suggested by email that "at least some of the increase in premiums in the past year has been caused by the actions of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress and their efforts to repeal and replace the ACA and undermine it bureaucratically." We also asked the experts to look over data activist Charles Gaba’s June 2017 web post, in the wake of the HHS report, estimating that across all 50 states, 2017 average monthly individual premiums on policies sold on exchanges were 84 percent greater than 2013 premiums on policies sold on the private market. Wilensky expressed doubts about figures Gaba relied on for New York and California while she, Tanner and Callaghan each said even an 84 percent rise over a few years seems large. Brandewie said he couldn’t speak to Gaba’s accuracy. Our ruling Cornyn told a constituent that under the Obamacare law, health insurance "premiums have increased by more than 105 percent since" 2013. This claim traces to an admittedly incomplete federal analysis of changes in 39 states that didn’t endeavor to research premium changes in 11 states that run their own insurance exchanges. It’s also worth clarifying that Obamacare policies must cover pre-existing conditions without penalty and they generally provide more benefits than what was required in most states in 2013—surely factors figuring into increased premiums. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-00114	"Ted Cruz had a net worth of $500K when he entered the Senate in 2012. Now he’s worth $4.6 million. Pretty impressive for a guy with a $174K salary."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/29/occupy-democrats/ted-cruz-net-worth-not-46m-according-best-calculat/	As U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-El Paso, tries to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a Democratic group is sowing suspicion about the finances of the junior senator from Texas. "Ted Cruz had a net worth of $500K when he entered the Senate in 2012," starts the text stamped on a viral black and white image of Cruz. "Now he’s worth $4.6 million. Pretty impressive for a guy with a $174K salary." "Follow the money, folks…" Occupy Democrats wrote when posting the picture to Facebook on Oct. 13. By this week, it had been shared nearly 40,000 times. This photo was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Occupy Democrats calls itself a political organization and information site that "provides a new counterbalance to the Republican Tea Party." In response to an email seeking more information about the meme, the group said that it didn’t make the graphic but, faced with questions about its accuracy, has edited its description to quote Snopes. "As far as we can tell, the only figure the meme states accurately is Cruz’s salary," it says. "Although the $4.6 million figure cited isn’t implausible, we don’t know how it was arrived at, or by whom. Nor were we able to ascertain where the other amount cited—Cruz’s alleged net worth of $500,000 in 2012—came from." Occupy Democrats originally fact-checked the $4.6 million figure "and found it to be generally accurate," the group said in an email to PolitiFact on Oct. 24: "Thank you for reaching out and for allowing us to acknowledge and correct our mistake. We will be more careful in the future when backchecking graphics that we did not create ourselves." The Cruz campaign didn’t respond to an email about the Facebook post. Here’s what we know Cruz does make $174,000 annually. All senators have been offered such a paycheck since 2009, when their salaries were increased from $169,300. But, as Abby Livingston of the Texas Tribune reports, it’s impossible to calculate the net worth of candidates for federal office based on their personal financial disclosure forms. That's because they don’t have to report exact amounts of income, financial assets or liabilities. Before winning the Senate in November 2012, Cruz filed a financial disclosure in July of that year showing that he and his wife, Heidi, had assets ranging from about $1.8 million to $4.4 million, according to our analysis. His liabilities ranged from about $900,000 to $2 million. Using these figures, it’s possible that the senator’s net worth was $500,000. If Cruz’s assets were worth $1.8 million, the low end of that range, and his liabilities totaled $2 million, the high end of that range, he would be in the red about $200,000. On the other hand, if his assets were worth $4.4 million and his liabilities $900,000, he could have been worth as much as $3.5 million back then. But that report covered calendar year 2011. Looking at the financial disclosure report Cruz filed in May 2013 for calendar year 2012 — the year he assumed his position in the Senate — his assets ranged from about $2.2 million to $5.1 million, and his liabilities ranged from about $750,000 to $1.5 million. The difference between the low end of the range for his assets and the high end of the range of his liabilities is $700,000. But if his assets were on the high end and his liabilities on the low end, the difference would be $4.3 million. The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics landed on slightly different numbers for 2012, with Cruz's assets ranging from $2.5 million to $5.9 million, leading them to estimate his net worth at $3.47 million. So, can we say, six years later that Cruz’ net worth is up to $4.6 million? In Cruz’s most recent financial report, which was filed in August 2018 but covers calendar year 2017, he listed assets ranging between about $2.2 million and $5 million, from stocks and a retirement plan, among other investments. He listed liabilities ranging from about $1.1 million and $5.4 million. If Cruz’s assets are in fact worth $5 million, the high end of that range, and his liabilities are only $1.1 million, the low end of that range, the most his net worth could be is about $3.9 million — not the $4.6 million claimed in the original graphic that Occupy Democrats shared. What other organizations have found It’s hard to pin down lawmakers’ net worth, but some organizations have nonetheless tried — with a caveat. Roll Call, which produces a "Wealth of Congress" study, warns its ranking is a window into House and Senate members’ finances but "far from comprehensive or exact." Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., is No. 1 on the Roll Call list with an estimated net worth of $283.3 million. The news organization, whose mission is to cover Congress, estimated O’Rourke’s net worth is $3 million, No. 97 among 530 voting senators and representatives in the 115th Congress (2017-2018). Cruz landed at No. 332 with an estimated net worth of about $200,000. Another financial footnote: Heidi Cruz is the managing director of Goldman Sachs in Houston. In a recent profile in The Atlantic, she described herself as the family’s "primary breadwinner," working 70-hour weeks to keep the Cruzes financially afloat. What do the numbers say about O’Rourke? Because this is a Democratic attack on Cruz, it’s important to look at how his challenger compares. O’Rourke also makes $174,000. He founded a technology company in El Paso and, according to the Tribune, he and his wife most recently listed assets — including a stake in that company, rental and commercial real estate, and his wife’s trust fund—that could range from $3.5 million to more than $16 million. The couple totaled liabilities between $1.3 million and $5.7 million, the Tribune reports. The Center for Responsive Politics estimated that in 2012, O’Rourke was worth $7.74 million. In 2015, according to the center, O’Rourke had an estimated net worth of nearly $9 million. Cruz, meanwhile, was worth $3.8 million that year, the group’s analysis shows. Our ruling O’Rourke isn’t an outlier — Congress has plenty of wealthy members — but the suggestion that his opponent is making more than his salary in a way that’s unique doesn’t reflect reality. At most, based on the information available in Cruz’s own financial disclosures, his net worth was more than $500,000 when he became a senator in 2012 and he was potentially worth several million. And, based again on the figures he shared in 2018, his net worth is between $1.1 million and 5.7 million. That’s quite a spread — too much of a spread, we believe, to declare his actual net worth. What’s more, like Snopes, the only figure we could confirm is Cruz’s salary. We rate this statement as False.	None	Occupy Democrats	None	None	None	2018-10-29T12:07:21	2018-10-13	['Ted_Cruz']

pomt-14138	"This is not a joke: the president wants to house illegal aliens on our nation’s military installations."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/may/04/john-carter/john-carter-says-barack-obama-wants-house-illegal-/	An Austin-area U.S. House member maintains that President Barack Obama has dangerous desires for military installations. U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, opened his commentary in the March 10, 2016, Round Rock Leader: "This is not a joke: the president wants to house illegal aliens on our nation’s military installations." Carter, saying that such a move would hinder troops’ effectiveness, wrote: "With the growing global threats of terrorism, how could any president think that housing illegal immigrants on military installations is the right thing to do?" His column also touted his 2016 proposal to bar such installations from sheltering anyone lacking "lawful immigration status." We wondered what Carter was talking about. By phone, Carter spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer said he was referring to an administration move that could have led to children lacking legal residency staying at Fort Hood, which is partially in Carter’s district. Schiermeyer said Carter learned in late 2015 that the Department of Defense had received a request for assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services to provide temporary housing for "unaccompanied alien children." Schiermeyer said Carter also was told a survey team would be investigating various U.S. locations, including Fort Hood in Killeen. We asked Schiermeyer if Obama had signaled his own desires to house immigrants on bases. She said: "If the president did not want this to happen, that request would never have been sent." We also sought documentation of the described plans; by phone, Schiermeyer urged us to obtain a November 2015 Pentagon memo to military officials that she said described the HHS request. We failed to come up with the memo but a White House spokesman, Peter Boogaard, emailed us a Dec. 7, 2015, letter from Sylvia M. Burwell, the secretary of Health and Human Services, to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, stating that "we anticipate needing to establish shelter facilities on DOD installations very soon." Burwell’s letter requested assistance in "exploring a staged response in activating up to 5,000 temporary beds as quickly as" possible. Burwell’s letter advised that her request came about because an "unprecedented" over 10,000 "unaccompanied children" apprehended along the country’s southwest border had been referred by Homeland Security in October and November 2015 to HHS for temporary housing. "Although HHS has 8,400 current bed capacity," Burwell wrote, "the highest in the history of the" unaccompanied children "program, we anticipate reaching 95% capacity within 10 days if recent trends continue." According to the Administration for Children and Families, part of HHS, an unaccompanied "alien" child is "a child who has no lawful immigration status in the United States; has not attained 18 years of age; and, with respect to whom, there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States, or no parent or legal guardian in the United States available to provide care and physical custody." A Dec. 8, 2015, New York Times news story on Burwell’s request said youths had crossed into the U.S. mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras with several factors possibly explaining the late-in-the-year uptick, especially a surge in violence in El Salvador. Fort Hood facilities assessed And what of Fort Hood? By email, an HHS spokesman, Mark Weber, confirmed that after the Pentagon heard from HHS, an assessment of Fort Hood took place in advance of children possibly living at the base though, Weber said, that "was determined not to be a viable option at this time." A Dec. 20, 2015, Killeen Daily Herald news story said buildings chosen for the assessment were in North Fort Hood, near Gatesville, in an area the "National Guard wants to use for soldiers who train at North Fort Hood throughout the year." On Dec. 17, 2015, Carter announced he’d sent a letter to the president and other administration officials expressing his opposition to the government providing temporary housing for "unaccompanied alien children at any U.S. military installation, including Fort Hood." On Jan. 6, 2016, Carter posted a statement saying that "after many discussions" with Homeland Security, Fort Hood was no longer on the list of possible temporary shelter locations. And in February Carter introduced the Resist Executive Amnesty on Defense Installations Act, which would prohibit "the use of military installations to house" any "aliens who do not have a lawful immigration status or are undergoing removal proceedings in the United States," which was referred to the House Armed Services Committee. Elsewhere, Weber told us, the Defense Department made space available to temporarily house 250 children at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, making possible housing for about 700 children. Children stayed on the base in January and February 2016, Weber said. Then the space went into "suspended" status after children were resettled with relatives, HHS spokeswoman Andrea Helling said by phone. Weber further advised that the Homestead Job Corps facility in Florida--lately vacant and not in operation as a Job Corps center--had been lined up to provide approximately 800 temporary shelter beds for unaccompanied children, if needed. In May 2016, Boogaard told us by email that "no DoD facilities are being used as temporary shelters, but such facilities could be used in the future if it becomes necessary and provided that such use would not impact DoD operations." Administration: Bases have sheltered children before As we looked into Carter’s claim, administration officials pointed out there’s precedent for children staying on bases--in accord with federal law. The first time vacant space was used to house children at a military base was in 2012, Weber said, at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio and HHS in 2014 opened three temporary shelters on bases to help the government handle a spurt in unaccompanied children apprehended near the border, Weber said. Temporary shelters at Lackland AFB, Fort Sill Army Base and Naval Base Ventura County-Port Hueneme "played a critical role in the humanitarian response, providing care to more than 7,700 children," Weber said, before HHS "suspended" the shelters in August 2014. Thousands of children annually enter the U.S. without legal permission -- sometimes without parents or guardians along. Next, the government detains many in advance of releases to family members and immigration hearings. In the 12 months through September 2015, the U.S. Border Patrol reported detaining nearly 40,000 unaccompanied children hailing from Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. That count was down from 68,451 children detained in the region the previous 12 months -- with many crossers coming in expectation of an immigration hearing and amid fears of violence, especially gang violence, in home countries, we noted in a June 2014 fact check. Two laws guide how the government manages unaccompanied minors. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the care and custody of "unaccompanied alien children" to HHS to "move towards a child welfare-based-model of care for children and away from the adult detention model," according to a "fact sheet" last updated in January 2016 by the Administration for Children and Families. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, under ACF, places children in shelter facilities, foster care or group homes, residential treatment centers or secure care facilities, the agency says. In fiscal 2015, children stayed in an agency-supervised facility for an average of 34 days, according to the sheet. According to the "fact sheet," the Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008 requires HHS to promptly place each child in the "least restrictive setting that is in the best interest to the child, taking into account potential flight risk and danger to self and others." That act (which cleared the House without objection) has no proscription on placing children in federal facilities. Our ruling Carter said, "This is not a joke: the president wants to house illegal aliens on our nation’s military installations." It’s correct that on Obama’s watch, the U.S. agency responsible for temporarily caring for unaccompanied immigrant children has enlisted the Pentagon in occasionally sheltering children (a "minors" detail that didn’t appear in Carter’s commentary). Carter didn’t show nor did we spot an administration push to house adults on such installations. Also unsaid: The temporary housing of children in vacant military facilities is permitted under existing law. We rate Carter’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03888	"Do you know which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African-American voter turnout? Massachusetts. Do you know what has the best, where African-American turnout actually exceeds white turnout? Mississippi."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/05/john-roberts/was-chief-justice-john-roberts-right-about-voting-/	Chief Justice John Roberts quizzed -- and stumped -- U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. on some deep-in-the-weeds voting statistics during a recent oral argument at the Supreme Court. The comments came during a challenge to a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 law that ensured members of racial minorities the right to vote. In the case before the court, Shelby County, Ala., challenged how the Voting Rights Act determines whether a state or locality needs advance approval from the U.S. Justice Department before it changes any voting laws, regulations or procedures. The law requires advance approval for Alabama, as well as for five other southern states (Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Virginia) that demonstrated a poor historical record of allowing minorities to vote. Three other states (Alaska, Arizona and Texas) plus a variety of local jurisdictions are also subject to "preclearance." Shelby County argued that these requirements are outdated. At one point in the oral argument held Feb. 27, 2013, Roberts asked Verrilli, "Do you know which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African-American voter turnout?" Verrilli, who was defending the law as currently written, responded, "I do not." Roberts said, "Massachusetts. Do you know what has the best, where African-American turnout actually exceeds white turnout? Mississippi." Roberts was pointing out a striking irony -- that Massachusetts, a state well known for its liberalism, was seemingly a poor performer in protecting minority voting rights, yet Mississippi, a state for which the Voting Rights Act demands intensive federal scrutiny, actually seems to be a model of voting equality. It would be a powerful argument for changing the law, but the comparison quickly drew criticism, including from Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin. We wondered, does the chief justice have his numbers right? And if so, do they support his point? We looked at the data and checked with a variety of experts. We should note that the Supreme Court has declined to elaborate on Roberts’ data selection, but there is wide agreement among voting experts that he was using data from the Current Population Survey, a widely used U.S. Census Bureau survey. The survey provides data on registration and voting on a state-by-state and race-by-race basis every two years. The experts came to this conclusion because there don’t appear to be any other data sources that provide the information Roberts cited. George Mason University political scientist Michael McDonald, who filed an amicus (or friend-of-the-court) brief supporting the current law, told PolitiFact that he believes Roberts was basing his comment on 2004 Current Population Survey data, since that year’s findings had been cited in a previous lower-court dissent in the Shelby County case. However, since Roberts didn’t specify a year during oral arguments -- and since he used the present tense -- we think a reasonable listener would assume that the chief justice is referring to the most recent data available. So we will focus on data for 2008 (the last presidential election year available) and for 2010 (the last midterm election year available). In a moment, we’ll begin by looking at some of the problems with using Current Population Survey data to back up Roberts’ claim. After that, we’ll grant for the sake of argument that the Current Population Survey is valid for this purpose and look instead at why Roberts’ interpretation of the data is less than ideal. Finally, we’ll discuss why, despite these problems, Roberts has a reasonable point to make. Why the Current Population Survey isn’t a good source of backup on Roberts’ point • The survey has large margins of error for black populations. Generally speaking, any survey that collects data from a relatively small group of people will have a larger margin of error than a survey that collects data from a larger group of people. So when the Current Population Survey looks at Massachusetts, the margin of error for the figures relating to the entire state population are fairly small, but the margin of error for figures relating to the state’s African-American population (which accounts for just 6 percent of adults in the state) is bigger. With a smaller pool of African-Americans responding to the survey, there’s simply a bigger chance that a few bits of off-base data will skew the whole sample. This appears to be what happened with Massachusetts (as well as with other states that have relatively small black populations). The survey found that in Massachusetts, 52 percent of all adult citizens voted in 2010, with a margin of error of about two percentage points. But the same survey found that 39 percent of black voters in Massachusetts voted in the same year, with a much larger margin of error of 11 points. This means the black voting rate actually may have been as high as 50 percent -- pretty close to the percentage for the state as a whole. • The survey shows some perplexing year-to-year changes. You generally wouldn’t expect to see a large movement in the rates of voter registration from year to year, since once voters are registered, they typically stay on the rolls until they move or die. But the Current Population Survey data for voting registration among Massachusetts residents fluctuated wildly between 2008 and 2010. The registration gap between whites and blacks ballooned from 13.8 percentage points in 2008 to 36.5 percent in 2010, an almost threefold increase in just two years. Such a large change casts doubt on how reliable the Massachusetts sample is. • The Current Population Survey has some questionable policies for coding respondents’ answers on voting questions. Last year, McDonald, the George Mason professor, began noticing some unusual patterns in the Current Population Survey’s raw data, and he wrote about it. The survey allows one of two possible answers to the question of whether a respondent (or someone else in their household) voted in the last election: "yes" and "no." That made sense, until McDonald realized that the survey had a curiously broad definition of "no." With questionable logic, the survey counted three categories of answers as "no" -- if a respondent refused to answer the question, if the person answering the question didn’t know whether someone else in the household had voted, or if they were somehow not asked the voting question. This caused big problems for the data, McDonald concluded: It means the Current Population Survey data counts many more respondents saying "no I did not vote" than actually didn’t vote; worse, the likelihood of obtaining these non-answers differs by racial group. For instance, in 2008, McDonald found, 21.9 percent of Massachusetts blacks were counted as having a "non-answer" on the voting question, compared to 13.5 percent of Massachusetts whites. McDonald tried to rectify this problem by re-calculating the data using only the clear "yes" and "no" answers. When McDonald looked only at the clear responses, he found that the voting percentages in Massachusetts ended up at 80.2 percent for whites and 78.0 percent for blacks -- a statistically insignificant difference. Even if you assume the Current Population Survey is a good source of data, Roberts has cherry-picked by citing Massachusetts Let’s say for the moment that, despite the evidence cited above, the Current Population Survey is a valid source of data for Roberts’ purpose. There’s still a case to be made that he’s cherry-picked the data. We analyzed the registration and voting numbers for 2008 and 2010 and found that Massachusetts was well out of the national mainstream in both years. This becomes clear when you compare Massachusetts to other large, relatively diverse northeastern states. Since most of its New England neighbors have black populations too small for the Census Bureau to provide data, we looked at four other states for comparison -- Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. In 2010, when the white-black registration gap in Massachusetts was a whopping 36.5 percentage points, the average for the other four northeastern states was a much more modest 9.8 percentage points. Two years earlier, Massachusetts voting rates showed a 25.8 percentage point white-black gap, compared to just 6.3 percentage points for the other northeastern states. It’s unclear why the Massachusetts data was so different, but if Roberts wanted to make his point by looking at the voting gaps in large, northeastern, "liberal" states, he could have chosen four that had relatively modest racial gaps. Instead, he chose the one outlier, Massachusetts, and that amounts to cherry-picking. Where Roberts has a point Roberts is on more solid ground with his discussion of Mississippi. Unlike the comparison of Massachusetts to its northeastern neighbors, Mississippi’s data in the Current Population Survey fits in closely with that of its neighbors in the deep south, which we’ll count as including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. And because the black population in these states is proportionally much larger than it is in Massachusetts, the margins of error for these states in the Current Population Survey are much less problematic. In 2010, three of these deep south states had black registration rates higher than for whites, and four had black voting rates higher than for whites. The remaining deep south states were roughly at parity between the races. And this pattern was much the same in 2008. Perhaps even more striking, this pattern was particular to the deep south. Black registration and voting rates were much less likely to exceed that of whites in other southern states -- Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. So why has there been such strong black voting activity in states of the deep south? The government and supporters of the existing law say these high rates of participation stem from the Voting Rights Act’s preclearance provision itself, and they cite this as a major argument for keeping the law as is. Experts also suggest that the experience of living through the civil rights battles of the 1960s, or hearing about them from older relatives, has shaped a culture in which African-Americans in the deep south make a special point of voting. Whatever the reason, the high rates of participation suggest that Roberts has a point: Voting rates in Mississippi, and the deep south generally, have improved over the years. McDonald acknowledges this point -- even though he filed an amicus brief in the Shelby County case in favor of keeping the law as is. The chief justice "has a legitimate question that has to be asked and answered -- if you aggregate up the southern states, we know that turnout among African-Americans has gone up," McDonald said. "He would have been much better served if he hadn’t cherry-picked. He deserved to have that question answered." Our ruling Roberts said, "Do you know which state has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African-American voter turnout? Massachusetts. Do you know what has the best, where African-American turnout actually exceeds white turnout? Mississippi." For several reasons -- including unacceptably wide margins of error, strange year-to-year inconsistencies and problematic coding policies -- the survey data Roberts likely used to back up his point on Massachusetts is questionable. And even if this data source had been reliable for his purposes, Roberts’ decision to hold up Massachusetts as his primary example amounts to cherry picking, since its data diverges significantly from that of its regional neighbors. However, Roberts makes a valid point when he notes that black voter turnout in Mississippi and other deep south states is high, and indeed often exceeds white turnout. So while Roberts is on shaky ground with Massachusetts, he’s on more solid turf when it comes to Mississippi. On balance, we’ll call it Half True.

pomt-14866	"Women fill two-thirds of minimum wage jobs."	mostly true	/iowa/statements/2015/nov/13/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-most-minimum-wage-workers-are-women/	Hillary Clinton has been campaigning hard to win the votes of women nationwide. Recently, she made a bold statement on women in the working world. In a Sept. 18 speech at a roundtable on women's economic security in Washington, she said women make up two-thirds of minimum wage workers. The former secretary of state went on to claim those women are left "at the mercy of employers." "Without equal pay, without flexibility or predictability at work, without access to quality, affordable childcare, without (the) ability to take a day off if your child or aging parent is sick, without paid family or medical leave," Clinton said. "This woman is really on the brink." We wondered if her figures were right. Could women really make up that large a share of minimum wage workers? A look at the numbers We contacted the Clinton campaign, and it pointed to a report published by the National Women's Law Center in May 2015 for a bulk of its evidence. The report presents highlights and statistical tables describing minimum wage workers in 2014. The report found that women represent close to but not quite two-thirds of minimum wage workers across the country, and at least half of minimum wage workers in every state. The center looked at unpublished U.S. Labor Department data for all wage and salary workers for 2014. Estimates from the study put 1.9 million women workers at or below minimum wage out of 2.9 million total – about 62.7 percent – age 16 and older. This represents an increase of 0.4 percent from 62.3 in 2013, the report said. When we went to the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics to verify the figures for ourselves, we found out that only 59 percent of workers actually making the federal minimum wage are women. That’s because some workers, like those who earn tips, can legally be paid a lower wage. Clinton has stressed her proposals would also result in a raise for those tipped workers – such as restaurant servers and bartenders. "Women hold nearly three-quarters of the jobs that are reliant on tips," she said. In addition, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour would leave a single mother below the poverty line. While 29 states and the District of Columbia currently have higher minimum wages, the center found that in every one of those states, the minimum wage leaves a full-time worker with two children near or below the poverty level. But what does it mean? Economists say the claim raises another question: Who will benefit if the minimum wage is increased? Data from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, show that 55.9 percent of those who would receive a raise under Clinton’s proposal are women. That’s a solid majority, but well below two-thirds. Chris Tilly, director of the UCLA Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, said that makes Clinton’s statement misleading. University of Iowa Associate Professor of Political Science Timothy Hagle said that Clinton’s claim may fall under campaign hyperbole. He said the data used by the Clinton campaign is filled with qualifiers, such as "about" and "nearly," that make it difficult to check concrete calculations. "(The law center report) gives Clinton a bit of an out in that she can inflate her comment based on this data," Hagle said. "Rather than that of some other entity." Our ruling Clinton said, "Women hold two-thirds of minimum wage jobs." Her campaign referred us to a credible May 2015 study that supports her claim. According to the study, 62.7 percent of minimum wage workers age 16 and older are women. That’s almost, but not quite, two thirds. In addition, that study ignored complexities like minimum wage workers in places that have a higher wage already and who would benefit from changes relating to tips. Clinton is largely on point with her numbers. We rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-11-13T11:27:11	2015-09-18	['None']

pomt-07237	"Annual water usage in 2010 was actually down more than 18 percent from usage in 2006."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/01/charlotte-nash/gwinnett-water-use-down-how-much/	Charlotte Nash, the new head of Gwinnett County government, did some bragging about her county in a recent speech. One of the claims was about water, specifically how much less H2O Gwinnett homeowners used in recent years. "Annual water usage in 2010 was actually down more than 18 percent from usage in 2006," Nash, chairwoman of the county’s Board of Commissioners, said in her May 18 State of the County address. Perhaps the statistic was true, considering that county and state officials have pleaded with Georgians to use less water after state environmental protection officials announced a ban on most types of outdoor watering in September 2007. The ban was lifted in June 2009. Currently, political leaders in Georgia, Alabama and Florida are battling over a water-sharing agreement. A county spokeswoman suggested Gwinnett residents and business owners are being more conscious about conserving water. "It would seem the water conservation trend that started during the extreme drought continues," Gwinnett spokeswoman Heather Sawyer told us in an email to explain why water use has declined in Georgia’s second-highest-populated county. Sawyer also suggested Gwinnett’s toilet rebate program may be another factor in conserving water. The program gives homeowners a $50 to $100 discount for installing toilets that use less water when flushed. PolitiFact Georgia was still curious about Nash’s numbers. The county’s population grew, according to U.S. census figures, from 588,450 residents in 2000 to more than 805,000 in 2010, a 37 percent increase. Nash’s statement claimed the county’s water use dropped by 18 percent in four years, yet the county’s population increased by 37 percent over the past 10 years. Gwinnett officials provided us a spreadsheet with annual water use data dating to 1999. The average daily use for most years between 1999 and 2007 was nearly 84 million gallons a day. In 2007, the year the drought restrictions took effect, the average daily use was 86.4 million gallons a day. In 2008, the average daily use in Gwinnett dropped to just below 72 million gallons a day. The one-year decline was nearly 17 percent. That one-year decline was actually less than the drop in the region, state officials told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2008. They said water use in North Georgia dropped by 24 percent from August 2007 to August 2008. We felt better about believing the drop in water use in Gwinnett between 2007 and 2008. So, let’s take a closer look at Nash’s claim of an 18 percent decline from 2006 to 2010. Sawyer alerted us to an error in the math work. Staffers used the difference between the 2006 and 2009 totals to come up with the 18 percent reduction. Gwinnett officials say the average daily use was 87.4 million gallons in 2006 and 71.3 million gallons a day in 2009. In 2010, the average daily use was 74.7 million gallons a day. That is a 14.3 percent decline. Since the 14 percent reduction is pretty close to 18 percent, we don’t consider the error to be that egregious. We rate Nash’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-15059	There is not "one of the Muslim nations" that doesn't have "discrimination against women, discrimination against gays, subjugation of other religious beliefs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/25/ben-carson/ben-carson-do-any-muslim-countries-have-womens-rig/	Muslim values are inconsistent with American values, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said recently. Carson has been on the defense for saying he doesn’t believe a Muslim should be president. A couple of days later, in a Sept. 22 interview with Fox’s Megyn Kelly, the former neurosurgeon justified his position by criticizing the governments of Muslim countries for their human rights records. "If you look throughout the world at Muslim government, I see discrimination against women, discrimination against gays, subjugation of other religious beliefs," said Carson, a resident of West Palm Beach, Fla. "And I would be very interested in somebody showing me one of the Muslim nations where that is not occurring. I haven't seen it." We decided to help Carson out and look into whether there are Muslim countries -- that is, those with a majority-Muslim population -- with governments that don’t discriminate against women, members of the LGBT community and religious minorities. Carson does have a point that a majority of the 50-odd Muslim countries do have poor records in all three categories. However, he overlooks some important exceptions. Women’s rights To assess women’s rights in these countries, we turned to the World Economic Forum’s 2014 Global Gender Gap Index, as well as the 2014 Social Institutions and Gender Index report published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. The Gender Gap Index ranks 142 countries based on gender disparities within each nation, including economic opportunity, educational attainment, political empowerment and health. The United States is No. 20, while Iceland is No. 1. By this measure, the 34 Muslim countries on this list don’t have a solid record on gender equality. Just eight crack the top 100 -- Kazakhstan (43), Kyrgyzstan (67), Bangladesh (68), Senegal (77), Albania (83), Azerbaijan (94), Indonesia (97) and Brunei (98). The OECD index instead measures how much gender discrimination a country’s institutions project. Although it isn’t ranked on the overall index list, the United States is listed as "low" or "very low" discrimination in all categories except "civil liberties," for which it is labeled "medium" discrimination -- for reasons such as low numbers of female elected leaders and no national paid maternity or paternity leave. Of the 43 Muslim countries included in the report, most have "high" to "very high" levels of institutional discrimination in most categories. Just three are categorized as "low" discrimination across the board -- Kazakhstan, Morocco and Turkey. Labeled "medium" are Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Senegal and Indonesia. It’s also worth noting that multiple Muslim countries have had female heads of government or heads of state, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Turkey, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan and Senegal. Zakia Salime, an expert in gender and Islam at Rutgers University, also pointed out that numerous Muslim countries signed the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, while the United States did not. She added that abortion is legal in some Muslim countries, including Turkey. LGBT rights We had a little more trouble pinning down which, if any, Muslim countries have little institutional discrimination against the LGBT community. We did, at least, figure out which ones criminalize homosexuality, according to the Human Rights Campaign and the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, both advocacy groups. Of 48 majority-Muslim countries, homosexual relations are legal in 13: Albania, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Mali, Tajikistan and Turkey. In some of these countries where homosexual activity is legal, there is still some institutional discrimination against LGBT people -- such as a ban on cross-dressing in Bahrain. In some other Muslim nations, homosexuality is legal in parts of the country. As for same-sex marriage, it is not legal in any majority-Muslim nation. Religious freedom As far as institutional challenges to religious freedom, we looked at democracy advocacy group Freedom House’s 2015 Freedom in the World report. In coming up with their overall freedom index, Freedom House scored each of the countries it assessed based on "freedom of expression and belief." The United States scored a 15 out of 16 in this category. Of the 47 Muslim countries included in the study, nine got a score higher than 10 out of 16 in "freedom of expression and belief": Tunisia (13), Sierra Leone (12), Senegal (15), Niger (11), Mali (11), Lebanon (11), Indonesia (12), Burkina Faso (13) and Albania (13). Notably, Senegal received the same score as the United States. But many Muslim countries got low scores in this category -- including seven nations that scored just a one or two. We also looked at Muslim countries in the State Department’s 2013 Religious Freedom Report. The department reported a vast majority of these countries as having some institutional restrictions on religious freedom. But the report said several Muslim countries had no significant restrictions -- mostly overlapping with the countries that received high scores on the Freedom House list. In sum While there are many majority-Muslim nations that do have a record of institutional discrimination against women, members of the LGBT community and religious groups, there are plenty of exceptions. These exceptions are enough to call into question Carson’s implication that none of the nearly 50 Muslim countries -- and by extension the world’s 1.7 billion Muslims -- respect these rights. Many Muslim countries have a longstanding tradition of democratic rule, particularly in the Far East, such as Bangladesh, said Ahmed Souaiaia, a professor of Islamic law and human rights at the University of Iowa. Souaiaia said he has conducted research in Tunisia, where religious minorities and women’s rights are protected in the country’s constitution. "To reduce the actions, beliefs and views of 1.7 billion people to a stereotype is stunning," Souaiaia said. Our ruling Ben Carson said there is not "one of the Muslim nations" that doesn't have "discrimination against women, discrimination against gays, subjugation of other religious beliefs." Carson has a point that many countries with a majority-Muslim population do have poor records on institutional discrimination against women, members of the LGBT community and religious minorities. However, his broad-brush statement glosses over the fact that such policies are not universal. Numerous Muslim countries offer freedoms in each category. We rate the claim Mostly False. CLARIFICATION, Nov. 24, 2015: We've updated this article in response to a reader's suggestion, clarifying that the list of Muslim countries that have had female leaders includes both heads of state and heads of government.

pomt-04332	"If Buehler were elected, our vote-by-mail system would be at risk."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/26/bill-bradbury/would-knute-buehler-shelve-oregons-vote-mail/	As is the trend in other states, Republicans in Oregon tend to argue for tighter security against potential voter fraud, while Democrats defend the system we have now. That message is nearly impossible to miss in the race for Oregon secretary of state. According to incumbent Kate Brown and other prominent Democrats, a vote for Republican candidate Knute Buehler is a vote for right-wing Republicans and a vote to kill our vote-by-mail system. This week, former Democratic Secretary of State Bill Bradbury, who was in office when Oregon became the first state to conduct a presidential election entirely by mail, chimed in with his thoughts on Buehler in a fundraising pitch: Republican Secretary of State candidate Knute Buehler is right on message with the Republican talking points trying to scare voters (out of) vote-by-mail. If Buehler were elected, our vote-by-mail system would be at risk." Sal Peralta, secretary of the Independent Party of Oregon, asked PolitiFact Oregon to check it out. Buehler also is the Independent Party’s nominee for this office. (The other candidates in the race, by the way, are Pacific Green Seth Woolley, Libertarian Bruce Alexander Knight and Progressive Robert Wolfe.) Voters approved the citizen ballot measure switching to mail-in voting by a 2-to-1 ratio in 1998, so we know it was well received. Is it true that Buehler has a beef against the system? As evidence of Buehler’s alleged hostility toward vote-by-mail, Democrats have cited language from a column written by Oregonian columnist Steve Duinabout Republican attempts in other states to introduce new ID requirements for voters. Brown is quoted as opposed to the "war on voting." The part involving Buehler, we offer in its entirety, because readers need the context. Knute Buehler, the Bend Republican opposing Brown in November, said he has no interest in ending vote-by-mail. The system is a popular element of the state's independent streak, he said, and he isn't hearing -- or pushing -- a move to return Oregonians to the polls. But Buehler does say, "There is some concern about the integrity of the process, where it takes more ID to rent a movie at Blockbuster than it does to vote. There are thousands of ballots floating around in various locations during the process. There are concerns about undue pressure to vote, because you don't have the privacy of a polling booth. "And I'm not sure we've done a thorough evaluation to see how we're dealing with these integrity issues." . See that part where Duin writes that Buehler said he has no interest in ending vote-by-mail? Democrats probably saw that too, but for some reason, chose instead to focus on the language about Blockbuster and ballots floating around and the privacy of a polling booth. Buehler, in an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, said he still thinks it takes more ID to rent a movie than to register to vote in Oregon. He supports the idea of an audit of the system. And Buehler repeated to us -- as he clearly stated to Duin -- that he does not want to end Oregon’s vote-by-mail system. "I love vote-by-mail," he said. "My point is that I just want to make it the best that it can be. Why are people so concerned about studying something?" We also talked to Bradbury. "My understanding is that he has stated that the vote-by-mail system has had many problems with fraud," Bradbury said. "If you’re convinced that vote-by-mail is a fraud-filled system, it’s very unlikely that you’re going to support strengthening vote-by-mail." We told Bradbury that Buehler didn’t say that the system was filled with fraud -- just that there were questions that he wanted to address. Bradbury’s response? "I don’t feel very comfortable with someone being in charge of vote-by-mail if their biggest concern seems to be that there is a fraud-riddled system, or they’re listening to friends who think it is." We also offered Brown’s campaign spokeswoman a chance to comment. "Knute questions the very nature of vote-by-mail by saying that there is 'undue pressure to vote because you don't have the privacy of a polling booth.' Knute’s statement fundamentally argues against vote-by-mail’s existence," said Jillian Schoene in an email. Briefly, let’s get back to the remark about Blockbuster. Buehler is interested in beefing up identification requirements to register to vote in Oregon, and that position definitely puts him to the right of Brown on the issue. But changing the requirements of registering to vote doesn’t mean the way we vote in Oregon would be at risk by electing Buehler. Democrats are hammering Buehler for raising questions. Raising questions about vote-by-mail -- even talking about the possibility that some people may feel pressured outside a polling booth -- is not the same as wanting to end vote-by-mail. Does Brown want to get rid of state agencies just because her Audits Division raises questions about them? We think not. That’s her job. PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t do predictions. Obviously, we don’t know what Buehler would do if elected. More important, Democrats don’t know either. When we look at the evidence they’ve provided for his alleged antipathy toward the system, we just aren’t convinced. In fact, the evidence indicates that he likes vote by mail just fine. We don’t know how many more times -- or in how many more ways -- he can say that he supports mail balloting. The statement is inflammatory and ridiculous. We rule it Pants on Fire.

pomt-00058	"Do you know that New York State pays out way more than they ever get back?"	true	/new-york/statements/2018/nov/02/nathan-mcmurray/new-york-giver-state-federal-treasury/	In the campaign’s final days, Democrat Nathan McMurray has discussed the Republicans’ recent tax bill, signed into law last year. McMurray seeks to unseat Republican Chris Collins in New York’s 27th Congressional District. As he criticizes Collins' vote for the bill, McMurray tells audiences that New York residents send more money to Washington than they get back in benefits. "Do you know that New York State pays out way more than we ever get back," McMurray said during a debate at St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute in Tonawanda. "We’re a giver state, while there’s other states that are taker states." Is McMurray right? Negative balance Several analyses in recent years have reached similar conclusions. Generally, states with high-income earners send more money to Washington than states with low-income populations. States that consume more federally taxed products, such as alcohol and gasoline, also send more money to Washington. Meanwhile, states with more federal workers and contracts, such as Maryland and Virginia, or those with higher health care costs and poverty rates, receive more in federal spending. There are other drivers of how much states get in federal funds. Florida, with a lot of retirees, receives more Social Security payments than other states. State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli issued a report on the balance of payments between New Yorkers and the federal government in October. DiNapoli, an elected Democrat whose office reports on state finances, concluded that for every dollar New York sent to the federal government in federal fiscal year 2017, it received just 90 cents in benefits. The average return for all states was $1.19 for every dollar they send to Washington, D.C., DiNapoli said. DiNapoli’s latest findings are consistent with what he has found in analyses conducted in two prior years. In 2013, the state received 91 cents for every dollar it sent to Washington, and in 2016, it received 84 cents for every dollar it sent. In fiscal year 2017, New York sent $24.1 billion more in tax payments to Washington than it received, DiNapoli found. New York sent nearly $250 billion to the federal government, while federal funds spent in New York totaled $225.7 billion. New York’s high per-capita payment to Washington relative to other states is driven by its higher-than average contributions in corporate taxes, individual income taxes, and social insurance taxes, such as Social Security and unemployment, the comptroller found. Meanwhile, New York receives less per capita than other states when it comes to federal workers’ wages and defense spending, but more than other states for Medicaid. New York is just one of 11 states that sends more to the federal government than it receives, DiNapoli said. New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut fared worse than New York when it comes to federal taxes paid and benefits received. New Mexico has the most favorable balance of federal taxes and received benefits. The Rockefeller Institute for Government, a nonpartisan public policy think tank in Albany, prepared an analysis during the debate about President Trump’s tax bill. "New York’s negative balance of payments was the largest of any state by far, roughly equaling the combined shortfalls of #2-ranked New Jersey and #3-ranked Illinois," according to a Rockefeller analysis of fiscal year 2015, published in September 2017. On a per-capita basis, New York had the third-worst balance of payments. More than a decade ago, an analysis from the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank, found that in 2005 New York received 79 cents for every dollar it sends to Washington. Should it matter? In a system of progressive taxes, where wealthier people pay more in taxes, it’s not surprising that some states pay more to the federal government than they receive, analysts said. "Because one goal of the federal system is redistribution, it is not surprising that some states ‘give’ far more than they ‘get,’ while the opposite is true for other states," according to an analysis from the SUNY-affiliated Rockefeller Institute of Government. An economist from the Tax Foundation, which raises about a third of its support from businesses, wrote in 2006 that strictly considering whether a state gets as much as it pays in isn’t "a very civic minded view of federal government. Presumably citizens pay federal taxes to provide for the common defense and to support other national programs that benefit the nation as a whole." Our ruling McMurray said that New Yorkers send "way more" money to the federal government than the federal government sends to New York. Whether it is a good idea or not that every state receives back from the federal government what its residents and businesses paid to Washington, McMurray’s statement is accurate, based on the latest available data and analyses.

pomt-00144	"Stacey Abrams burning the flag of the state she seeks to serve as Governor."	half-true	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/25/blog-posting/did-stacey-abrams-burn-georgias-flag/	With Democrat Stacey Abrams in a deadlocked race with Republican Brian Kemp for Georgia governor, some of her opponents are casting doubt on her loyalty to the southern state. "Stacey Abrams burning the flag of the state she seeks," reads a Oct. 21 post shared on Facebook. "Do we really want someone who would desecrate the flag of our beloved Georgia in our Governor’s mansion? I don’t think so. This should disqualify her from consideration by anyone who loves Georgia." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post shows what appears to be a black-and-white newspaper photo of four people. "Burning Georgia’s ‘racist past’ is how Lawrence Jeffries (right) described the flag-burning Sunday at the capitol," the caption says. "From left are Ina Solomon, Jeffrey Harris and Stacy Abrams." The woman identified as Abrams is standing in the background with her arms crossed, though her face is obscured. The post also includes an apparent news article clipping with the headline: "AUC students burn state flag in protest at Capitol." The story describes 10 students from the Atlanta University Center—members of its Students for African American Empowerment student group—who wanted the Confederate symbol removed from the state flag. Speakers said that "the Georgia flag symbolizes a brutal time in the history of African Americans, and they demanded that the Legislature restore the original Georgia flag: the state seal superimposed on a field of blue," the story says. "The current state flag — the Confederate battle flag alongside the state seal — was adopted in 1956 by defiant Georgia lawmakers who were angered by court-ordered integration." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has claimed the article and photo as its own; they appeared in the newspaper in June 1992. (Abrams’s name is misspelled in the story.) Another story that ran in the paper that month identifies Abrams as one of three students who helped lead the Atlanta University Center’s protests after the Rodney King verdict. She was an 18-year-old freshman who was working on a congressional campaign, according to the article. The story also quotes Abrams and her father, a United Methodist minister named Robert Abrams. "‘Stacey is not going to stop what she’s doing because of other people,’ Mr. Abrams said, just days after his daughter received abusive phone calls because she helped lead the rally where Georgia’s flag was burned." "It’s been unsettling," Stacey Abrams is quoted as saying. "I got a call from one woman who said her family died in the Civil War, and the flag was a symbol of Southern heritage. She said if black people didn’t like the flag, get the hell out. It’s really strange to have someone call your house, ask for you by name, and call you a nigger. I’m used to stuff like that. When I was in the 10th grade, I had a police escort because my dad spoke out against the KKK. But I have to tell my parents what we’re [SAAE] going to do beforehand. I told them we were going to a demonstration, and we were going to have a rally. I kind of left out the flag burning part." In a statement sent to PolitiFact from Abigail Collazo, director of strategic communications for Abrams’s campaign, the spokesperson describes Georgia at a crossroads during the candidate’s college years. The state was "struggling with how to overcome racially divisive issues, including symbols of the Confederacy, the sharpest of which was inclusion of the confederate symbol in the Georgia state flag," the statement says. "Stacey was involved with a permitted, peaceful protest against the Confederate emblem in the flag. This conversation was sweeping across Georgia as numerous organizations, prominent leaders, and students engaged in the ultimately successful effort to change the flag." While it’s true that Abrams was at a protest where Georgia’s state flag was burned, context matters. It wasn’t the flag that the state flies today, because the Confederate symbol that Abrams was protesting has been removed. We rate this statement Half True.

We wondered, did Trump get involved in picking Cleveland? If he did, we couldn’t find a trace of it. We asked the Trump campaign for details, and we’re still waiting to hear back. Trump’s statement seems odd because of the timing. The Republican National Committee named a site selection committee in January 2014. Cities submitted proposals to show that they had a big enough venue, enough hotel rooms, the organizational heft to pull all the pieces together, and activities for the delegates. By April, the committee had winnowed its choices down to Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, and Las Vegas. On July 8, 2014, the Republican National Committee announced it had picked Cleveland. At the time, Trump not only wasn’t a candidate, he didn’t seem to be a likely candidate. An Associated Press rundown of the potential contenders didn’t include Trump, but it did have Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Rand Paul, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, Rick Santorum and Scott Walker. With the exception of Paul Ryan, everyone on the list ultimately threw his hat into the ring. We looked to see if Trump had any reaction after Cleveland was picked, but there was no sign of him in the convention coverage. Instead, all we found were articles about the closure of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. Trump said more closures might be on the way. We spoke to Steve Duprey, a member of the site selection committee, and he told us he doesn’t recall Trump’s name coming up in any meeting. "It’s possible he said something to somebody, but I never heard of it," Duprey said. We did not hear back from the committee chair. A search of the Nexis database of newspapers, transcripts and wire reports going back long before Cleveland was announced produced no statement from Trump. His name and the Republican convention didn’t appear together in the first half of 2014. Our ruling Trump said he liked having the convention in Cleveland and that he had recommended Ohio. It’s possible that he put in a good word for either Cleveland or Cincinnati (both are in Ohio), but there’s no record of him saying anything about either one. He was not a candidate when Cleveland was picked in 2014, and he made no public statement at the time. The Trump campaign hasn’t published any evidence of an early recommendation, nor could we find any in a Nexis search. Plus, a member of the site selection committee has no recollection of Trump having voiced a preference. The selection of Cleveland was conducted by the party in 2014, when it wasn’t known who would ultimately win the nomination. We rate Trump’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/44939ce5-14be-4a28-8aa9-24b69bd5f3e9	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-18T23:57:37	2016-07-18	['Ohio', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-00065	Say Socialist candidate Norman Thomas said in 1944 that the Democratic Party had adopted the Socialist platform.	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/02/blog-posting/no-evidence-norman-thomas-quote-democrats-embracin/	Eighty-three years after the Social Security Act was signed into law and 53 years after the enactment of Medicare, fears of socialism continue to define American politics A Facebook post quoting prominent socialist Norman Thomas is making the rounds, garnering about 31,000 shares since Oct. 12. It suggests that the Democratic Party has been using the Socialist Party agenda of the 1940s. It claims that Thomas, in a 1944 speech, said, "The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But, under the name of 'liberalism,' they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation, without knowing how it happened." The meme goes on to quote Thomas as saying, "I no longer need to run as a Presidential Candidate for the Socialist Party. The Democratic Party has adopted our platform." Thomas was a Presbyterian minister, social worker, pacifist, prolific author, and co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union. He ran for president six times. The meme being spread says, "If you aren't scared, you're not listening." The author of the Facebook post, Vincent Schmuki, says (in all caps), "IT WAS ALL PART OF THEIR PLANNED TAKEOVER OF AMERICA!" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact often checks on whether famous people actually uttered the words attributed to them. In this case, the lack of evidence suggests the answer is no. We found plenty of places on the Internet that were using the quotation, but none cite a checkable source. Many say it comes from a Thomas speech in 1944, although no day or venue is offered. Another says it was during a 1948 interview during one of Norman's presidential campaigns but, again, with no reference and indication where the interview was published. Ronald Reagan, 20 years before he became president, used the first part of the quote in a 1961 radio address attacking Medicare as socialized medicine and asserting that Norman said it in 1927. Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, editorial advisor at the State Net Capitol Journal, wrote in "Governor Reagan: His Rise to Power," that the quotation was one of his favorites. "This is a suspect quotation, and Reagan gave no reference for it," Cannon wrote. "If Thomas said this, I have been unable to find evidence of it, and Reagan told me in 1968 that he did not know its origins," Cannon said in a footnote. "Thomas often did say, however, that both major political parties had borrowed items from the Socialist Party platform, including Social Security." More to the point, Cannon said, "Reagan was vulnerable to using bogus quotes in his speeches because he clipped so many items out of newspapers in which such quotations abound." One example Cannon cited was a fake quote from Alexis de Tocqueville about the goodness of America. Cannon reported in that 2003 biography that, "By the 1960s, the deeply pacifist Thomas was more of a social democrat than a socialist, and the United States was not then or every close to 'going socialist.'" Two of Thomas' best-known biographers have died: W.A. Swanberg (author of "Norman Thomas: The Last Idealist") in 1992 at the age of 84 and Harry Fleischman (a prominent socialist in his own right and author of "Norman Thomas: a biography") in 2004 at the age of 90. Our attempts to track down Thomas biographer Raymond F. Gregory though his publisher were unsuccessful. We also looked for the quote in some of the Thomas writings available online, including, "How Can the Socialist Party Best Serve Socialism" (1949), "What's Behind the 'Christian Front'" (1939), "Democracy versus Dictatorship" (1937) and "Why I am a Socialist," (undated). None included the quote. The same was true of Murray B. Seidler's 1961 biography of Thomas, "Norman Thomas: Respected Rebel." Finally, we contacted the New York Public Library, which has a collection of Thomas' writings that fills the equivalent of 193 boxes. Thomas G. Lannon, assistant director for manuscripts, archives and rare books wrote to say that among the transcripts from radio broadcasts and stump speeches from 1944, the quote in the Facebook meme "cannot be found. In fact, there are many speeches in which Norman Thomas suggests people should vote Socialist up until election day, Nov 7, 1944. Many if not all of his speeches before the November election in 1944 were opposed to the two party system. The idea that Norman Thomas would have said the Democratic Party had adopted the Socialist Party platform runs counter to all the text of speeches that still exist from those Thomas delivered in 1944." Until someone -- anyone -- can offer evidence that the quote came from Thomas, we rate this post False. Update: This story was updated after publishing to include comment from Thomas Lannon at the New York Public Library. The rating remains unchanged."

pomt-12543	"A trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 million, according to a Government Accountability Office report."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/18/center-american-progress-action-fund/how-much-do-donald-trumps-trips-mar-lago-cost/	In his first 13 weeks as president, Donald Trump spent more than half of his weekends away from the White House. Trump’s frequent visits to his Palm Beach, Fla., club inspired a liberal political nonprofit to create a website with a catchy URL: IsTrumpAtMarALago.org. The website, built by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, allows users to compare the steep cost of Trump’s trips to the cost of providing various public services, like school lunches. The fine print appears, at first blush, to back up the eye-popping amount. "A trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 million, according to a Government Accountability Office report," the website says. We’ve seen similar estimates of Trump’s travel costs pop up on various news and media sites. Nearly every one can be traced back to a single GAO report from October 2016. The GAO is an independent, reputable federal agency that researches how the government spends money. But this report doesn’t exactly back up what the critics are saying, even if it’s the best available estimate of a presidential trip to Palm Beach. The report did not estimate the specific costs of Trump’s weekend escapes to the so-called Southern White House, though a reader would get that impression. Instead, the report, titled "Presidential Travel: Estimated Costs for a Specific Presidential Trip to Illinois and Florida," found that a four-day trip President Barack Obama took to Chicago and Palm Beach in February 2013 cost approximately $3.6 million. It’s not fair to assume that those costs are typical for presidential travel, the author of the report told us. Nor should we assume that Obama’s 2013 trip and Trump’s 2017 trips have similar price tags, even though both presidents went to Palm Beach. "We wouldn’t recommend substituting the numbers from President Obama’s trip to any other trip," said Brian Lepore, director of defense capabilities and management at GAO. Here’s why. When the president travels, generally several military aircraft are involved. These include Air Force One, carrying the president, his entourage and guests, cargo planes packing motorcade limousines and other equipment, and aircraft to transport personnel who conduct security sweeps before the president arrives. This is the main driver of presidential travel costs. Air Force One alone costs nearly $180,000 per hour of flight as of 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service. The GAO report found that total air and boat support accounted for more than 85 percent of the $3.6 million spent on Obama’s 2013 trip. But these costs change significantly from trip to trip, so it’s hard to nail down the average cost. For example, a president could take two identical weekend trips to Palm Beach, both trips requiring a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. But one trip could cost a good deal more than the other depending on where the C-130 has to fly in from. Military logistics could mean that one week it comes from Delaware, the next from Texas. Or, if the president’s event schedule for one of the Palm Beach weekends requires a helicopter, an additional or bigger plane might be necessary to transport the helicopter. Other details can, on a smaller scale, affect the cost to taxpayers from trip to trip, such as the number of staff traveling with the president or the number of venues that need a security sweep. Or if the trip is for a non-official political event or vacation, the president and others traveling with him reimburse the government for some of the costs. This is not all to say that Trump’s traveling isn’t expensive or unusual. And as of week 13, Trump has spent 25 days away from the White House at another private residence, while past presidents spent far less at the same point in their term. Obama spent four days away; George W. Bush, 14 days; and Bill Clinton, zero days, according to the New York Times. And beyond Trump himself, the government is spending at least hundreds of thousands of dollars protecting Trump’s family, including first lady Melania Trump who’s currently living in New York City with their son Barron, and sons Donald and Eric as they travel around the world on business. But it’s wrong to assume that the Mar-a-Lago trips cost the same as a specific trip Obama took to two cities over four days in 2013, based on this one GAO report. Corey Ciorciari, policy and research director at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, acknowledged this but said he’s still comfortable with $3.6 million as a reasonable, if not conservative, estimate for the cost of one of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago trips. He said some of the Mar-a-Lago trips could cost even more than $3.6 million because they involved foreign leaders, like Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, while the 2013 Obama trip did not. Unfortunately, this GAO report is the only recent official report on presidential travel costs. The next-best thing we came across was a GAO report from 1999 about trips President Bill Clinton took to Africa, Chile and China. Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning organization that has sued both Democratic and Republican administrations, estimated that the Obama administration spent more than $96 million over his eight years on presidential travel, based on records they obtained from the military and Secret Service. The group’s director, Tom Fitton, has said they’re also examining how much Trump’s travel is costing taxpayers. The GAO recently accepted a request from Democratic lawmakers to examine the costs of Trump’s Mar-A-Lago trips. Lepore said the investigation will likely get under way in a couple weeks, but he didn’t have a time frame for when it would be complete. Our ruling The Center for American Progress Action Fund said, "A trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 million, according to a Government Accountability Office report." No doubt, a presidential trip out of Washington is expensive. It's reasonable to assume that Trump's multiple weekends at Mar-a-Lago cost taxpayers millions. But the GAO report in question, one of very few available estimates of the cost of presidential travel, did not say exactly that a trip to Mar-a-Lago cost $3.6 million. The report covered a specific trip Obama took in 2013 covering two cities including Palm Beach. To say each Trump Mar-a-Lago visit costs the same as the Obama trip is imprecise. There are too many unknown variables to say for sure. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11912	"And over the last six years, Chicago’s economy has grown faster than the economies of New York City, Washington, D.C., or the national average."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2017/oct/20/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-plays-fast-and-loose-fast-growth-boast/	Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s 2018 budget address included a series of statements highlighting the city’s economic growth under Emanuel’s leadership. Emanuel noted the building boom that has dotted the city’s skyline with "58 cranes" and a surge in corporate relocations as well as heavy foreign investment in Chicago. He topped it with a claim about the city’s economy as a whole. "And over the last six years," Emanuel said, "Chicago’s economy has grown faster than the economies of New York City, Washington, D.C., or the national average." This has become a standard talking point that Emanuel has repeated often in interviews and public settings. We’ve heard it often, yet we’ve never heard an explanation of what constitutes the economic growth Emanuel claims. We thought it was time for a closer look. Economics 101 Emanuel’s claim covers a lot of ground, so we contacted his office to find out whether it’s based on specific data, studies or reports. Despite several attempts and an assurance that we’d hear back with an answer, we never did. So our next stop was the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is the official source for measuring economic growth nationally and regionally. The numbers there present a mixed bag on Emanuel’s statement. Using gross domestic product as a yardstick from 2011 through 2016 (the most recent year available), Chicago’s economy grew 7.4 percent, which was better than Washington, D.C., (3.8 percent) but lower than that of New York (7.6 percent) and the U.S. as a whole (10.9 percent). Chicago also led Washington but trailed New York and the nation when using growth in personal income as a standard, said BEA economist Jeff Newman. Geoffrey J.D. Hewings, emeritus director of the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory at the University of Illinois, found largely the same results but offered a caveat to judging Emanuel’s statement. "The main problem is that generalities like this depend upon context. Clearly, there is little appreciable difference in the economic performance between Chicago, (New York) and the U.S. as a whole; Chicago does do better than D.C.," Hewings said in an email. "However, given the fiscal problems in Illinois, it is surprising that Chicago has done as well as it has and of course, the city of Chicago has faced significant fiscal challenges as a result of rather creative accounting manipulations in the last decade." Another potential measure of economic growth is unemployment, the standard measure of which is gauged by Metropolitan Statistical Area rather than by individual cities. Using the latest full-year average unemployment figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found metropolitan Chicago reduced its unemployment by 41 percent -- from 9.9 percent to 5.8 percent -- between 2011 and 2016. That’s better than Washington’s 37 percent but behind New York’s 44 percent and the United States’ 45 percent reduction in unemployment during that time. In September 2017, greater Chicago’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.1 percent and its year-to-date average is 4.7 percent, according to the Illinois Department of Employment Security. But a report by Moody’s Analytics in June noted that Chicago’s declining unemployment, which this year dipped "below the national rate for the first time in a decade," may not be cause for celebration. "The decline over the past year is larger than that in all but a handful of metro areas and divisions in the country. However, it occurred only because the labor force is contracting," wrote Moody’s analyst Sarah Crane. Crane cautioned, however, that Emanuel’s claim still has some merit. "Chicago’s economy is advancing," Crane said in an email, "but its relative performance to New York, D.C. or the U.S. depends on which economic measures are considered." Our ruling Emanuel said that "over the last six years, Chicago’s economy has grown faster than the economies of New York City, Washington, D.C., or the national average." We don’t know exactly what criteria Emanuel bases this statement on because his office did not respond to repeated requests for specifics. But the most obvious benchmarks for judging economic growth don’t back him up. Chicago did better than Washington, D.C., on certain metrics, but we found no evidence of it out-performing the New York or national economies over an extended period. We find this statement Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Rahm Emanuel	None	None	None	2017-10-20T05:58:00	2017-10-18	['New_York_City', 'Washington,_D.C.', 'Chicago']

pomt-01097	The CIA paid two psychologists $81 million "to develop and run their torture program."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/12/doonesbury/doonesbury-cia-paid-81-million-torture-program/	With North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., now in charge of Senate oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency, it’s unclear how much the CIA’s torture legacy will remain in the spotlight. But leave it to Doonesbury to pipe up with a reminder that enhanced interrogation came with an enhanced price tag. In Sunday’s Jan. 11 strip, the debauched character Duke, now a K Street lobbyist, looks up from his newspaper in surprise. "It turns out that before 9/11, the CIA didn’t have any real torture experience," Duke says. "So they hired these two psychologists, Dr. Jessen and Dr. Mitchell, to develop and run their torture program. For which they were paid $81 million!" A reader asked us if that was accurate, and we can report that in large part, it is. When asked for his source, Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau told PunditFact "this one is an easy Google," and sent us a Wikipedia link. We looked at the report from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and found the key details on page 18. "The CIA contracted with two psychologists to develop, operate, and assess its interrogation operations," the report said. "In 2005, the psychologists formed a company specifically for the purpose of conducting their work with the CIA. Shortly thereafter, the CIA outsourced virtually all aspects of the program. In 2006, the value of the CIA's base contract with the company formed by the psychologists with all options exercised was in excess of $180 million; the contractors received $81 million prior to the contract's termination in 2009. In 2007, the CIA provided a multi-year indemnification agreement to protect the company and its employees from legal liability arising out of the program. The CIA has since paid out more than $1 million pursuant to the agreement." The Senate report did not name the two psychologists, but many news reports did. The Los Angeles Times reached James Mitchell at his home in Land O’ Lakes, Fla. The paper reported that Mitchell rejected the committee’s description of his work. "Go ahead and smear me if you want," Mitchell told the Los Angeles Times. ‘A lot of what's written in the Senate … report is just flat-out wrong. It's taken out of context." (We're attempting to reach Mitchell; if we hear from him, we'll let you know.) The Los Angeles Times described how Mitchell’s colleague Bruce Jessen was on hand in 2002 when an Afghan detainee was stripped and dragged down a hallway. The detainee was later found dead in an unheated cell and an autopsy concluded that he likely froze to death. There are some details the cartoon doesn't go into that are worth noting. First, Mitchell and Jessen’s company had a total of seven owners. So presumably the two men weren't the only people receiving money. Second, the $81 million isn't pure profit. According to the Los Angeles Times, the money covered a range of expenses. Mitchell and Jessen's company "provided interrogators, operation psychologists, debriefers and security guards" to CIA secret prisons. The final payments included $75 million for services and $5 million in case the company faced criminal prosecution or other legal liability, the Los Angeles Times said. Our ruling Doonesbury, aka Garry Trudeau, said that the CIA paid two psychologists $81 million to develop and run its torture program. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report confirms the amount of money spent on a variety of things. Other news organizations revealed the actual names of the two men -- though in reality seven people owned the company. The claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-07286	"A gallon (of gasoline) delivered to the front lines for our troops in Afghanistan cost more than $400."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/may/23/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-says-gasoline-troops-afghanistan-/	When President Obama announced that Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta would replace Robert Gates as Defense secretary, Rep. Marcy Kaptur took the the pages of "Politico" to offer him advice. In suggesting that the Defense Department needs to cut back on its use of petroleum products, the Toledo Democrat said: "Even before the oil companies and Wall Street speculators drove up the price of gasoline close to $4 a gallon, the landed cost of a gallon delivered to the front lines for our troops in Afghanistan cost more than $400." PolitiFact Ohio already thought gas prices in Ohio were outrageous, but the idea of spending $400 per gallon boggles the mind. So we decided to look into the claim by Kaptur, a member of the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Pentagon. We started with Kaptur’s office. Her staff said she gleaned her information from testimony delivered to her subcommittee. A 2009 report in The Hill, a Washington publication, recounted some of that testimony. The Pentagon comptroller’s office gave appropriators that statistic to explain the high cost of keeping troops in Afghanistan. It factors in the transportation and security costs of transporting the fuel into areas with a lack of infrastructure, challenging geography and increased roadside bomb attacks. "It turns out that when you factor in the cost of transportation to a coastal facility in Pakistan, or airlifting it to Kandahar - and then you add the cost of putting it in a truck, guarding it, delivering it to the battlefield, and then transferring that one gallon into a piece of equipment that needs it - in extreme cases that gallon of gasoline could cost up to $400," Navy Secretary Ray Mabus told a 2009 Naval Energy Forumin Virginia. One U.S. Army official has said the "fully burdened" cost of transporting fuel into remote areas can be as high as $1,000 per gallon. "In some places you have to fly it in by plane or by helicopter and drop off bladders of fuel," Kevin T. Geiss, program director for energy and partnerships in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment told Army News Service. "Those costs can be an additional $20, $40 or even $200 a gallon." High fuel costs in military battlegrounds predate U.S. military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. A May 2001 Defense Science Board report cites the true cost of military fuel at "$17.50 per gallon for USAF worldwide tanker-delivered fuel, and hundreds of dollars per gallon for Army forces deep into the battlespace." Retired Army Brigadier General Steven M. Anderson, who handled military logistics operations for Gen. David Petraeus in Iraq during 2006 and 2007, offers a slightly different picture -- that the cost of bringing gasoline to troops in Afghanistan actually works out to be at least $30 per gallon, and is possibly as high in the mid-40s. He told a Capitol Hill Briefing on fuel convoys in Afghanistan and Iraq that it cost about $13.88 per gallon to transport a gallon of gas to troops in Iraq when he worked there in 2007, and the amount has risen since then to $17.44 cents per gallon. He explained that it’s more expensive to bring gas to Afghanistan because "Iraq is a land of six lane highways from one end to the other" while "Afghanistan is perhaps the most isolated country in the entire world." He said the $400 per gallon figure for gas that others have cited for Afghanistan applies only when fuel must be brought by aircraft to the most remote areas. "If we’re flying water up there, it’s $400 per gallon, or toothpaste or whatever," Anderson said. "Anything that flies is expensive." Retired Air Force Lt. General Norman R. Seip, who spoke at the same event, described the $400 per gallon cost as a "worst case scenario," that accounts for a tanker providing airborne refueling to a cargo plane. He said the lower figures are more reasonable. So where does that leave Kaptur’s statement? Numerous sources have said it can cost as much as $400 per gallon to provide gas for troops in Afghanistan. That the statistic seems to be a high end number is a piece of information that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate her statement Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-13722	Says "Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to gamble with your retirement benefits in the stock market."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/jul/27/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-trump-pence-want-gamble-americans-/	Retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid spent what is likely his last turn in the national spotlight throwing shots at the Republican presidential ticket. Reid, speaking at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 27, warned that the ticket of Donald Trump and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence would roll back Democratic accomplishments and de-stabilize Social Security. "Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to gamble with your retirement benefits in the stock market," Reid said. "Republicans want to tear down the pillars of middle-class security." Democratic warnings about Republicans meddling with Social Security benefits are a well-trodden line of attack, and one we’ve fact-checked before. But does it apply to Trump and Pence? Strange bedfellows Trump has been somewhat unusual among major Republicans in flatly rejecting any calls for entitlement reform, including Social Security. "We're gonna save your Social Security without making any cuts," he told a crowd in Georgia in February. "Mark my words." He responded to a June AARP questionnaire on making Social Security solvent in the future by essentially focusing on economic reforms, and didn’t mention any proposals to change the structure of the entitlement program. "If we are able to grow the economy, increase the tax base, bring capital and jobs back to the United States and encourage foreign direct investment, we will shore up our entitlement programs for the time being," he said. Though he’s been consistent on the issue during this presidential run, Trump sung a different tune back in 2000, when he called for privatizing the entitlement program and compared it to a Ponzi scheme. Entitlement reform, including changes to Social Security, is one of the major policy areas where Pence’s past record hasn’t matched up with Trump’s promises on the campaign trail. Pence has strongly supported several attempts to modify Social Security, but it is an exaggeration to call it "gambling" with benefits in the stock market because the choice would be up to workers. While in Congress, Pence backed the 2005 Social Security reform proposal, which would have allowed workers to invest some of their payroll taxes into private accounts and reduced the benefit growth rate for future high-income retirees. Pence even sent a letter to President George W. Bush in 2005 asking him to avoid compromising on the proposal. He told a CNN interviewer in 2010 that he’d be open to cutting the existing program and raising the retirement age, saying, "We need look at everything on the menu." Our ruling Reid said Pence and Trump "want to gamble with your retirement benefits in the stock market." Pence may have a record of supporting Republican proposals to change Social Security to allow for more investment into private funds, but Trump has clearly and repeatedly said this campaign cycle he has no plans to modify Social Security or introduce elements similar to the Bush’s failed 2005 attempt to restructure the entitlement program.

pomt-02408	Austin is "a city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded."	true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/07/lee-leffingwell/austins-population-has-doubled-every-25-years-or-s/	Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell, set to relinquish his office after this year, warned in his last "State of the City" address that growth continues to pinch. Setting up his pitch for voter approval of an inner-city rail line, Leffingwell said Austin is "a city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded." Take that, all ye who bemoan how much the city has grown (oh-so crowding the roads) just since you arrived. To our inquiry, mayoral spokesman Reyne Telles told us by email that Leffingwell was referring to population growth, not geographic expansion. Telles added that Leffingwell based his declaration on a chart posted on the city’s web page devoted to local and regional demographics as overseen by Ryan Robinson, the city demographer. The chart shows the city’s population in many of the years from 1840 through 2013. That would cover Austin’s lifetime. An Austin History Center web page says the city, originally Waterloo, was purchased to be the capital of the Republic of Texas in March 1839 and renamed in honor of Stephen F. Austin. The city was incorporated on Dec. 27, 1839. In Austin’s early years, the chart indicates, the population doubled even more frequently than Leffingwell said. Specifically, the population surged six-fold from 1840 to 1860, going from 553 to 3,493, according to the chart, while over the next 20 years, the number of residents increased three-fold, to 11,013. The population doubled in the next 20 years, reaching 22,258 in 1900, the chart shows, before nearly doubling over the next 25 years, reaching 42,174 in 1925, up 90 percent from 1900. It took 15 years for the population to double afresh; it reached 87,930 in 1940, according to the chart. Twenty years later, the chart shows, Austin’s population of 186,545 was more than double its 1940 population. It took 23 years for another doubling, according to the chart, with the 1983 population reaching 373,541. Some 25 years later, in 2008, the city’s population of 750,525 was double its 1983 population, the chart shows. To get the most up-to-date sense of growth from the chart, we also looked at whether the mayor’s claim holds up if we look back in time starting in 2013 when Austin had 842,750 residents. That 2013 tally was almost double the city’s population 25 years earlier. Gauged another way, the 2013 population was more than double Austin’s population of 417,033 in 1985. So, that doubling took 28 years. Telles of the mayor’s office also pointed us to a city report featuring a graphic (below) showing Austin’s population growth since 1900. "Austin’s growth has been very close to doubling every 20 years," the report says. Our ruling Leffingwell said Austin is a "city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded." That's right per changes in population, making this historical statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-14459	The wives of the 9/11 hijackers "knew exactly what was happening" and went back to Saudi Arabia two days before the attacks to watch their husbands on television flying the planes.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/03/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-false-claim-about-911-hijacke/	When the subject turned to terrorism during the March 3 Republican presidential debate in Detroit, Donald Trump called for being tough on the families of terrorists, not just the terrorists themselves. As an example, he resurrected a claim he has made before — that the wives of the 9/11 terrorists knew what was going to happen and fled the United States to Saudi Arabia just before the attacks. "A man flies in the World Trade Center and his family gets sent back to where they were going — and I think most of you know where they went and, by the way, it wasn't Iraq. But they went back to a certain territory. They knew what was happening. The wife knew exactly what was happening," Trump said. "They left two days early with respect to the World Trade Center and they went back to where they went and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon and probably trying to fly into the White House except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane." During part of the response it sounds like Trump is talking about one wife, but he subsequently makes it clear that he's talking about all of the planes involved in the attack — actually there were four. So in the same breath he seems to be talking about multiple wives. Trump was clearer during the December 15 GOP debate in Las Vegas when he said that friends, family, girlfriends "were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia. They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television." Regardless, Trump’s account of what happened in September 2001 doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Of all the hijackers, not one had a wife, girlfriend or family member in the United States during the days or months leading up to the hijackings, according to the 9/11 Commission report. Not all were pinpointed, but "they sure weren’t living in the United States," Philip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission, told PolitiFact in mid-December. In fact, only two of the 19 hijackers were married and only one had a girlfriend, and she was living in Germany. The commission concluded that most of the 19 hijackers had "broken off regular contact with their families" long before the attacks, except for the hijacker with the girlfriend in Germany. He was on the plane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania. Investigators concluded after extensive interviews that she knew nothing about the plot. Trump’s words might reflect some confusion with the hastily organized departures of members of Osama bin Laden’s extended family -- not any wives or girlfriends of bin Laden himself -- a few days after the attack. Most of the bin Laden relatives were in high school or college in the United States. In an interview with the New York Times, Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan said that with the help of the FBI, his government arranged for these people to assemble in Washington where a chartered plane would take them back to Saudi Arabia. But it seems clear Trump wasn't talking about them. And the fact that some of those relatives were evacuated from the United States for their protection doesn't make what Trump said during the Fox debate any more accurate. Trump's claim is False.

pomt-08468	"(Strickland) raised taxes last year to the tune of $840 million."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/13/john-kasich/gop-challengers-labels-ohio-gov-ted-stricklands-ta/	Over the past month of their hotly contested race for governor, Republican challenger John Kasich has accused Gov. Ted Strickland of raising taxes on Ohioans, a charge the Democratic governor has vehemently denied. Kasich has leveled the tax hike charge in his public speeches, during both gubernatorial debates and in campaign commercials. He says the governor’s decision last December to halt a scheduled 2009 income tax cut essentially took away $844 million in refunds earmarked for Ohioans and instead gave it to the government. A television ad from the Republican Governor’s Association released this month features still photographs of Strickland with a woman speaking: "Ted Strickland promised not to raise taxes. He broke that promise." Strickland says he didn’t raise taxes, he only temporarily froze a planned income tax cut to fill an unexpected budget hole. Strickland’s running mate Yvette McGee Brown certainly feels comfortable with that explanation. "They had the nerve to say, the Republican Governor’s Association, that this governor (Strickland) raised taxes $800 million on Ohioans. Not true," Brown said during a rally on Sept. 27 in Cleveland with Strickland standing behind her. "And I wish PolitiFact would go check that." So, we are. The tax issue Kasich is referencing is Strickland’s decision last year to halt the final year of a five-year, 21-percent across-the-board income tax cut that started in 2005. The move saved the state approximately $840 million, money the governor used to fill a budget hole. The only alternative, Strickland insists, was to cut the equivalent amount of cash out of primary and secondary education. Strickland is careful to characterize his move as having frozen the final year of that tax cut and not having eliminated it altogether. The difference: what’s frozen can be thawed and used, but it might not be possible to replicate what has been completely erased. "We have cut the state income tax 17 percent since 2005," Strickland said during his Oct. 7 debate against Kasich, taking credit for the first four years of the tax cuts. Strickland became governor in January 2007. And the governor notes that the postponed final year tax cut is scheduled to be reinstated next year after the current budget cycle expires. Also, the decision to freeze the tax cut required legislative approval, which means the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate had to OK the deal and it did — narrowly. But having received the first four years of the tax cut, Ohioans were already looking forward to the final year, 4.2 percent reduction, Kasich said, until the governor snatched it away. "He raised taxes last year to the tune of $840 million," Kasich said on Oct. 4 during a press conference at the Ohio Republican Party headquarters. To be fair, Strickland had to find a source of revenue or would have had to slash programs. Ohio law requires the state budget be balanced. And part of the reason for the shortfall can be pinned on Republicans, who increased spending in seven consecutive budgets while they controlled the General Assembly while also cutting taxes. And the truth is Ohioans didn’t pay any more in taxes for 2009 over what they paid in 2008, and maybe less once you factor in some inflationary indexing. So, this was not a tax hike in that sense, which Kasich concedes. But he argues it is an increase when residents are forced to pay more in taxes than they had been promised, or to look at it another way, get back less in their state income tax refund than they anticipated. Those who owed the state after filing their 2009 taxes, owed a little bit extra thanks to Strickland’s tax freeze. Strickland’s decision cost a family of four earning $60,000 a year about $78 last year. Strickland prides himself on having made tough decisions in rough economic times. One of those decisions was postponing the income tax cut which meant taking money out of the pockets of Ohioans. But while the freeze is expected to be lifted next year, there are no guarantees that will happen in what is still a rough economic landscape for Ohio. And state taxpayers, who had to pay more in income taxes than what had been promised, may continue to pay at the higher rate. We rate Kasich’s statement Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-06019	Says over the last two years, New Jersey Schools Development Authority employees "have not started or completed one single school project, and I’m not talking about major school renovation. I’m talking about replacing boilers, roofs."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/16/david-sciarra/education-attorney-claims-state-officials-have-not/	Public school students are "trapped" in unsafe buildings, but state officials have been doing "nothing" to address the needed repairs. Even broken-down boilers and collapsing roofs are not being fixed. David Sciarra, executive director of the Newark-based Education Law Center, made that claim while criticizing the New Jersey Schools Development Authority during his Jan. 5 testimony before the Assembly Budget Committee. "These kids are trapped in dangerous, unhealthy, unsafe schools every day, because (of) the school construction shut down now entering its third year. And even worse, the SDA has now – I have to say this – two years of shut down, the SDA is close to spending $90 million over the last two years on staff and overhead, many high-priced employees sitting down the street, literally doing nothing," Sciarra told the legislators. "Nothing. They have not started or completed one single school project, and I’m not talking about major school renovation," Sciarra continued. "I’m talking about replacing boilers, roofs." There’s no doubt that school officials across New Jersey have been frustrated with the SDA over stalled projects, but PolitiFact New Jersey found that Sciarra is still out of line to claim that "nothing" has been done to address emergency repairs. The authority, which manages most projects in the 31 former Abbott districts, substantially completed 27 SDA-managed emergent projects during the past two years, including repairs on roofs, exterior masonry and boilers, according to SDA spokeswoman Andrea Pasquine. "Mr. Sciarra’s statement is patently untrue," Pasquine said in an email. Kristen MacLean, the authority’s director of communications, said those 27 projects were first identified by districts prior to Gov. Chris Christie taking office in January 2010, but the administration expedited the work. Sciarra, whose organization represents students in the former Abbott districts, acknowledged in an email that projects started before the Christie administration have been completed. But he said it’s "a virtual ‘drop in the bucket’ when compared to the hundreds of health and safety emergency projects and the major projects stopped by the Governor's shut down." Sciarra accused us of putting a "political spin" on his statement and advancing a "political agenda." Now, let’s mention some specific projects in Newark and Camden. In Newark, construction was substantially completed in 2011 on nine SDA-managed emergent projects, according to Steve Morlino, executive director of facilities management for Newark Public Schools. Those projects included roofing work at BRICK Avon Academy; Dr. William H. Horton School; and South Street School, according to a list provided by Morlino. Wendy Kunz, Director of Abbott Facilities Construction for the Camden school district, also pointed to a few emergent projects completed during the past two years, including replacing the roof and Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning units in 2011 at R.C. Molina Elementary School. But those and other former Abbott districts have not received approval for hundreds of other proposed emergency repairs. Newark school officials proposed work on more than 130 emergent conditions, but they have not been approved yet to go to construction, Morlino said. Following site visits, state officials are reviewing 300 emergent conditions identified by the former Abbott districts, Pasquine said. The districts identified more than 700 emergent conditions, but 400 of them were preliminarily rejected by the state Department of Education for not meeting the established criteria, she said. "The results of the site visits are currently under review to identify which conditions warrant advancement as emergent projects," Pasquine said in the email. "Additionally, SDA and DOE are developing a strategy for advancing those emergent conditions that require attention." Our ruling Sciarra claimed authority employees "have not started or completed one single school project," including "replacing boilers, roofs." Hundreds of emergency repairs proposed by school officials have not been approved yet, but the authority has substantially completed other projects during the past two years, including work in Newark and Camden. Of course, Sciarra and school officials want more done, but claiming "nothing" has happened is wrong. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-08385	"There currently are 825,000 student stations sitting empty across Florida in every district and at every grade level."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/24/yes-8/group-favor-amending-class-sizes-says-there-are-82/	Parents fed up with overcrowded classrooms helped pass an amendment in 2002 to limit class sizes in Florida. Now that school districts face the full effects this year of that amendment, the Legislature put another amendment on the ballot to ask if voters want to change the first one. This ballot issue is Amendment 8, which would tweak the rules to allow class sizes to be measured based on school averages rather than on classroom caps -- though there are also caps in terms of how many students assigned per teacher. To pass, the amendment needs 60 percent of the vote. Supporters of the amendment say the 2002 rules are too rigid and expensive to implement. According to the Florida Department of Education, districts have spent about $15.8 billion through the 2009-2010 school year on class size implementation statewide and are on track to spend an additional $2.9 billion for the 2010-2011 school year. But opponents say it's crucial to limit class sizes as the previous amendment intended. In a related Truth-O-Meter, we examined a claim from the opponents about the maximum number of students allowed in each class. We rated that claim Half True. As part of the argument in favor of changing the rules, the Yes on 8 group points out that there are hundreds of thousands of empty student stations statewide, meaning desks -- raising the question of why districts should need to make changes to limit class sizes. The group states on its website as of Oct. 20, 2010, "New class size caps in 2010 are forcing school districts to tax and spend huge sums to construct additional classrooms - even though there currently are 825,000 student stations sitting empty across Florida in every district and at every grade level." We wanted to check, are there 825,000 empty student stations in every district and at every grade level? First, some background. The 2002 amendment was intended to limit classrooms to 18 students per teacher in kindergarten through third grade, 22 for fourth through eighth grade, and 25 for high school classes. The rules apply to core courses, and don't include some courses such as gym or band. The amendment was phased in over time -- last year schools could go over the limit as long as they met average class sizes for the school. This school year was the first time that districts must meet the caps in each classroom. The Florida Department of Education has a handy website that explains how the rules would change if voters approve the constitutional amendment on Nov. 2, 2010. The new rules state that the maximum class size would be calculated based on a schoolwide average in core classes: • 18 students in prekindergarten through grade 3; • 22 students in grades 4 through 8; • 25 students in grades 9 through 12. Also, the new rules would set the maximum number of students assigned to each teacher while not exceeding the schoolwide average: • 21 students in prekindergarten through grade 3; • 27 students in grades 4 through 8; • 30 students in grades 9 through 12. Now back to the group's claim. We asked the Yes on 8 group if they actually meant 825,000 student stations in total across the state of Florida rather than the way they wrote it as "in every district and at every grade level." "Yes, we are talking about a total statewide number, not in every district,'' said Yes on 8 spokesman Ryan Banfill in an e-mail. The Yes group sent us a chart on Oct. 18 showing there were 845,044 additional student stations in kindergarten through 12th grade across Florida -- note that is about 20,000 higher than the group claimed on its website. The group said it obtained the chart from the Florida House of Representatives K-12 Appropriations Committee, which obtained it from the Florida Department of Education Office of Educational Facilities. Thomas Butler, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Education, confirms that the data came from the state DOE. He said that even though the chart states July 1 in the corner, the data was from September 2010 and is the most current available number of additional student stations statewide. All 67 districts showed additional student stations in the category of K-12. However, when broken down by age level, three districts had negative additional student stations -- overcrowding -- in either the K-3 range or 9-12 grades. We asked Banfill why the group listed 825,000 on its website but relied on data that showed 845,044. He said 825,000 was the figure from the state in February at the time when Republican lawmakers were pushing for the change. We found a Feb. 2 blog item in The Buzz from the St. Petersburg Times that cited the 825,000 figure. We asked the Florida Department of Education directly to provide information showing the number of additional student stations statewide. Butler sent us a link to a chart, dated June 30, 2010. That chart didn't state the number of additional student stations, but Butler said we could calculate it ourselves by subtracting the Capital Outlay Full Time Equivalent (full time equivalent student that needs facility space) line from the Total Student Station line to get 812,604. Note that is about 32,440 less than the September data but it's also not exactly the same data: the September data was for K-12 schools that must meet class size while the June data, Florida Inventory of School Houses (FISH), includes schools that don't have to meet class size requirements such as the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind and adult education classes. But the number of additional student stations statewide isn't the full story. Just because there are empty seats somewhere in the district -- or even in a particular child's school -- doesn't mean there aren't some classrooms that are overcrowded in that district. For example as of Sept. 15, Flanigan High School in Pembroke Pines, Broward County's second-largest city, was over-enrolled by 207 while Coconut Creek High School, in northern Broward, was under-enrolled by 856, according to James Kale, coordinator of educational specifications for Broward. Nor does it mean that students in the crowded schools could be transferred easily to the open seats to balance the classes and meet the size requirements. A district could face significant transportation and salary costs, not to mention parental blowback, if students were moved to new schools just to hit the average. So how does the Yes on 8 group's claim stack up? The group claimed "There currently are 825,000 student stations sitting empty across Florida in every district and at every grade level" based on data cited in February. We have a few quibbles with that. First, there is more recent data from September, and the number is even higher at 845,044. Second, the way the statement is written literally suggests that each school district has 825,000 empty seats. Common sense tells you that would be impossible so we think it was just poor word choice, not an intentional exaggeration. We must note that the 825,000 figure statewide still doesn't give a true picture of class size because it implies that districts can shuffle students around as needed to meet the requirements, and common sense tells you that's difficult, too. Still, the number we're ruling on is close enough. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Yes on 8	None	None	None	2010-10-24T16:23:59	2010-10-18	['None']

pomt-06235	In Iraq, "violence is down to an all-time low" since the start of the war.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/02/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-iraq-violence-down-all-time-low-sta/	On the Dec. 1, 2011, edition of NBC’s Today, Ann Curry sat down with Vice President Joe Biden while on a trip to Baghdad. Curry asked Biden, "How secure can Iraq really be when you as a vice president still must arrive under the cloak of darkness, under heavy security?" Biden responded that there are "still concerns here in Iraq, but if you take a look at it, Ann, violence is down to an all-time low, to all the way back to 2002. We're in a situation where it's been that way for the last year and a half, but there's still the one-off jobs that can occur." Indeed, during Biden’s trip, there were two separate attacks in northeast Iraq, killing 20 people and wounding 32, according to the Associated Press. A reader asked us to check whether violence is in fact "down to an all-time low" since the start of the war. We turned to two sources: the "Iraq Index: Tracking Variables of Reconstruction & Security in Post-Saddam Iraq," a project of the Brookings Institution that assembles a wide array of data about Iraq, and icasualties.org, an independent accounting of casualty statistics in Iraq and Afghanistan. We found that by most metrics, Biden is correct. But there are a few that show violence has increased -- though not dramatically -- from post-2002 lows. First, we’ll list the data that supports Biden’s claim. • U.S. troop fatalities. The number of U.S. troop fatalities in 2011 -- 53 -- is on pace to roughly match, or perhaps slightly fall short of, its level from 2010, which was 60. That was easily the lowest level since the war began, compared with the peak of 961 in 2007. There have been no troops killed by IEDs for three months running; none killed by mortars, rockets or rocket-propelled grenades for four months running; and none killed by car bombs since April 2009. • U.S. troops wounded in action. Citing Defense Department statistics, the Brookings study shows a steady decline in the number of U.S. troops wounded in action. Through the end of August 2011, there were 213 U.S. troops wounded, which is on a pace to fall short of the total for 2010, which was 389. That compares with a peak of 8,005 in 2004. • Estimated number of Iraqi civilian fatalities. The chart in the report shows this number at less than 250 per month for roughly the past year. The number peaked at about 3,700 per month in late 2006, and was 1,000 a month as recently as mid 2008. • Non-Iraqi civilians killed. This number -- which includes civilian contractors -- has been in the low single digits per month since mid 2008, after peaking at 31 in a single month in mid 2004. • Foreign nationals kidnapped in Iraq. There was one kidnapping in 2008, none in 2009, and one in 2010. This number peaked at 149 in 2004. • Journalists killed in Iraq. The total so far in 2011 is five, the same as the number for 2010. This number peaked with 32 in 2006 and 2007. Here are three areas for which today’s numbers are not the lowest since 2002. • Iraqi military and police killed. In June, July and August 2011, at least 50 Iraqi military and police were killed each month, which had been below 50 for most months since fall 2008. • Multiple-fatality bombings. This number has jumped around more than most. From the start of 2008 to the spring of 2011, the number has ranged from eight to 26 per month, with no discernible pattern. • Insurgent attacks in Baghdad. While the current level is far below its peak in mid 2007, the trendline has been edging slowly but consistently upward since early 2009. The researcher who put together the Brookings report told PolitiFact that Biden generally has the evidence on his side. "There’s little doubt that violence – while considerable still – has been lower over the past year or two" despite the exit of many American troops, said Ian Livingston, who works with fellow Brookings scholar Michael O’Hanlon on the report. Still, while current levels are "many, many-fold lower than the peak," Livingston said, bombings "are still pretty much a daily occurrence." Our ruling Not every statistic supports Biden’s statement that in Iraq, "violence is down to an all-time low" since the start of the war. But most of the statistics do.

pomt-10581	"(Romney's) record was that he raised taxes by $730-million."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/01/john-mccain/one-mans-fees-are-anothers-taxes/	Not willing to concede the True Tax Conservative mantle to Mitt Romney, John McCain reiterated in a Jan. 30, 2008, debate a claim he has made frequently about Romney's tax record as governor of Massachusetts. "His (Romney's) record was that he raised taxes by $730-million," McCain said. Bill Clinton once famously said, "It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is." Here, it depends upon what the meaning of "taxes" is. Romney says he never raised taxes. And in fact, he never raised the state income tax or sales tax rates as governor of Massachusetts. We addressed a related claim by Romney in a TV ad here. But he did raise "fees." And he did make changes to tax codes to close "loopholes" that resulted in some businesses having to pay more taxes. Here was Romney's take on McCain's charge during the Republican debate: "Now, why did we raise fees $240-million? We had a $3-billion budget shortfall, we decided we were not going to raise taxes, and we found that some fees hadn't been raised in as many as 20 years. These were not broad-based fees for things like getting your driver's license or your license plate for your car, but instead something like the cost of a sign on the interstate and how much it was going to cost to publish a McDonald's or a Burger King sign on the interstate. We went from, like, $200 a sign to $2,000 a sign to raise money for our state in a way that was consistent with the what the market had done over the ensuing years." Romney also raised fees for getting married, buying a house, bringing a case to court and using a public golf course. The amount raised by the increased fees is a matter of some dispute. Romney said during the debate that they came to just $240-million (previously, Romney has said the fees came to $260-million. It's unclear if he simply misspoke.). In a lengthy analysis of Romney's gubernatorial record, the Boston Globe said the $260-million, raised in 2004, ignores at least $71-million in new fees implemented shortly after Romney took office. In a 2006 fiscal policy report card on America's governors, the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, estimated the cost of the fees at $500-million and gave Romney a C. So when is a fee actually a tax? According to some tax groups, it's when the cost of a fee exceeds the cost of services rendered. Romney noted that the impetus for increasing fees was to pay down some of the massive debt he inherited as governor. So presumably some of the increased fees were used to subsidize unrelated parts of the budget. But other fees were simply antiquated. Said McCain: "He called them 'fees.' I'm sure the people that had to pay it, whether they called them bananas, they still had to pay $730-million extra." While McCain's campaign did not return calls for clarification, it appears McCain was referring not just to fees, but also to some corporate tax "loopholes" Massachusetts closed while Romney was governor. Some of them require a degree in accounting to follow. According to a Massachusetts Department of Revenue report, the "loophole" changes have brought the state an additional $377-million. "The governor at the time tried to say he was eliminating tax loopholes, not increasing taxes," said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. "But it's not in dispute that he raised taxes on corporations. We don't see it as 'closing loopholes.' " Romney was a Republican governor with a Democrat-controlled state legislature. For three years, he proposed cutting the sales tax from 5.3 percent to 5 percent, and all three times, he was rebuffed by the legislature. He was able to secure a one-time $250-million capital gains tax rebate. But was McCain right, did Romney raise taxes $730-million? Depends on what your definition of "taxes" is. If you include fees and the elimination of corporate tax loopholes, McCain is at least close to accurate. Here's the math: You take $377-million from closing the so-called corporate tax loopholes and add at least $260-million from fees (Romney's calculation). That puts the total at $637-million. Other estimates on the fees — $500-million, according to the Cato Institute — would put the total well above $730-million. The elimination of corporate tax "loopholes" clearly resulted in some businesses paying more taxes and to those businesses, fair or not, it sure must have felt like a tax increase. As for fees, it's nearly impossible to measure with precision how much of the increases were appropriate or simply a revenue-generating measure. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02012	The Chamber of Commerce says new carbon regulations will kill "244,000 jobs a year" and cost average families "$1,200 a year."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/09/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-epa-carbon-rules-will-kill-244000-j/	The White House on June 2 unveiled tough new regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. Moments after the long-awaited announcement, many Republicans panned it as the latest escalation in President Barack Obama’s so-called "war on coal" and said it would kill jobs, raise electric prices and hurt the economy. Among the GOP critics was U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie, who was campaigning that day in Southwest Virginia -- the heart of coal country. Gillespie, who is hoping to unseat Democratic incumbent Mark Warner this fall, was interviewed by WCYB-TV. "These new regulations on carbon emissions will kill, according to the Chamber of Commerce, 244,000 jobs a year, every year, for the next 15 years and will cost the average family of four $1,200 a year on higher energy costs," he said. Gillespie was referring to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that was released May 28 and became the basis for much of the GOP criticism of Obama’s carbon-reduction plan. The national goal of the regulations is to cut carbon emission from existing power plants by 30 percent by 2030 -- compared to 2005 levels. This is to be achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional "cap and trade" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many coal plants. But the chamber study that Gillespie and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030. That’s a significant difference when it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, a point that the chamber acknowledges. "We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward," Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told PolitiFact National. "Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study)." Why can’t the numbers simply be converted? In assuming Obama would set a higher goal, the chamber also postulated that the Environmental Protection Agency would be forced to change other policies to meet the 42 percent threshold. The goal would be attainable, the chamber concluded, only if the EPA by 2022 required new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology. The actual proposal, however, does not require plants to have such capabilities. This is important because, as the chamber report noted, plants with carbon capture technology are far more expensive to build and operate than traditional ones.Therefore, the chamber’s conclusion that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown. The chamber report said power companies would significantly increase their electricity rates to recoup the costs of building new plants with carbon capture technology. Businesses would recoup their increased energy expenses, the report said, by paring jobs. The EPA was highly critical of the chamber’s report and on the day of its release, blogged that the study was "irresponsible speculation based on guesses of what our draft proposal will be." It noted that the chamber failed to consider significant health and climate savings that would come from lowering carbon emissions. And the EPA tipped its hand, five days prior to Gillespie’s TV interview, by announcing its soon-to-be-revealed regulations would not require carbon capture. We also should note that Gillespie, in his TV interview, overstated two figures in the flawed report: He said an average family would spend $1,200 a year more on electricity; the actual figure was about $200. We asked Gillespie’s campaign for an explanation and spokesman Paul Logan said the $1,200 figure actually came from an analysis by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. Heritage’s estimate, released in March, incorrectly assumed that the EPA would phase out all coal-fired energy plants. Gillespie said the chamber predicted an annual loss of 244,000 jobs; the actual number was 224,000. In addition to his TV interview, Gillespie posted a tweet that applied estimates in the chamber report to the administration’s proposal. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said defended his boss’s comments by saying the chamber study "looked at a similar regulatory scheme" to what Obama proposed. As we noted, Gillespie was hardly the only Republican who used chamber statistics to denounce the White House proposal. Similar comments were made by U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th; Pat Mullins, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia; and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is using the statistics in a robocall attack against incumbent Warner, whom Gillespie is challenging. Our ruling Gillespie, during a visit to coal country, said new EPA "regulations on carbon emissions will kill, according to the Chamber of Commerce, 244,000 jobs a year, every year, for the next 15 years and will cost the average family of four $1,200 a year on higher energy costs." Gillespie refers to a May 28 chamber study that wrongly assumed the White House would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030 -- a standard that the report said could only met by requiring the construction of natural gas plants with expensive carbon capture capabilities. The regulations, released June 2, actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber says its estimates do not apply to the goals as announced. There was opportunity for Gillespie to realize the chamber’s assumptions were unreliable. Five days before his comments, the EPA announced that carbon capture would not be part of its upcoming proposals. Gillespie not only continued to use numbers from the report, he overstated some of them. We rate his statement False.	None	Ed Gillespie	None	None	None	2014-06-09T00:00:00	2014-06-02	['None']
pomt-03660	"Do you know those former Soviet Bloc countries have all moved to flat taxes?"	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/29/rob-woodall/rep-overstates-popularity-flat-tax-ex-soviet-state/	U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall is passionate about the Fair Tax – a plan to replace the patchwork of federal income taxes with a "flat" 23 percent sales tax – so it’s not surprising that it was on his mind when he took to the well of the House earlier this month. Woodall introduced a Fair Tax bill in January, after which it was assigned to the House Ways and Means Committee, where it sits today. Woodall wanted to dislodge it. The two-term Republican from Lawrenceville calls the Fair Tax a "plan of hope." "It is a plan to remove the heavy hand of government from your personal pocketbook and put you in charge of your finances and your life," he says on his congressional website. In his 7,400-word speech, Woodall made his case for ditching our current system for a flat tax. If we did, we’d actually be playing catch-up, Woodall said. "I look at what's happened in those former Soviet Bloc countries, Mr. Speaker," Woodall said April 16 in a House speech. "Do you know those former Soviet Bloc countries have all moved to flat taxes?" It is particularly galling to Woodall that the countries of the late Evil Empire have adopted this Reagan-era notion ahead of the United States. That is, of course, if it’s true. A small problem with checking Woodall’s claim is his terminology. There is the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is one set of countries, and there’s the Eastern Bloc, which included much of Eastern Europe. "Soviet Bloc" is a kind of hybrid of the two, but out of caution, we will assume Woodall was talking about the 15 countries left behind when the USSR dissolved. Many of those countries have adopted the flat tax, but five – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan – have not. Woodall declined to elaborate on the speech when PolitiFact contacted his office. His office pointed PolitiFact to a story in The Economist listing the 10 former Soviet republics with flat taxes. Daniel Mitchell, a flat tax advocate and senior fellow at the Libertarian Cato Institute, said Woodall was mistaken when he claimed every former Soviet nation had adopted the flat tax, but he said the idea has been "amazingly pervasive" in that part of the globe. Mitchell suspects their experiment with communism may be a reason. The former Soviet states have been governed by people that are less susceptible to class warfare ideology. That's been a big factor, he said in an email exchange. "After suffering for decades under communism, there's less sympathy for a redistributionist agenda." That outlook made it easier to embrace a flat income tax, rather than a system that is graduated by income level, Mitchell said. Estonia, a country of 1.3 million, was the first of the former Soviet republics to pass a flat tax in 1994, with Lithuania and Latvia close behind. Since then, Russia and six other former Soviet countries have joined suit. Mitchell said competition for international investment has been a factor. "Among the policy elite, the flat tax was seen as leading to more domestic growth, but I think they mostly saw the flat tax as a shortcut way of attracting capital from the outside," he said. "Sort of a shortcut to more prosperity." The trend is not restricted to the former Soviet states. Some former satellite states have instituted a flat tax and some, such as Slovakia, had it and then scrapped it. A final bit of context: Those nations with a flat tax still tax income. Woodall’s Fair Tax would tax sales, which is a different conversation. So Woodall was mistaken when he said all "Soviet Bloc" countries have embraced the flat tax. Many former communist countries, however, have adopted flat taxes, which was his larger point. We rate the congressman’s claim Half True. Staff writer Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this article.

pomt-05389	Says Gov. Scott Walker "has caused Wisconsin to lose more jobs than any other state in the country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/06/tom-barrett/dem-recall-candidate-tom-barrett-says-gop-wisconsi/	Even if Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had never promised that 250,000 private-sector jobs would be created during his first term in office, critics would have castigated him once the state’s monthly jobs losses began to mount. A direct attack was launched April 26, 2012, by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the Democratic frontrunner in the gubernatorial recall election, who said in a tweet: "Governor Walker has caused Wisconsin to lose more jobs than any other state in the country." Let’s address the two parts of the claim separately. Wisconsin lost most jobs Barrett’s tweet linked to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article published the same day, making it clear the period he was referring to in his tweet. In the article, Barrett cited a federal report that showed Wisconsin lost 23,900 jobs from March 2011 to March 2012 - the most in the country. That included 17,800 government jobs and 6,100 private-sector jobs. So Wisconsin did lose more jobs than any other state during the period Barrett cited. (For those of you keeping score on Walker’s private-sector jobs promise, they are up 5,900 during Walker’s tenure, according to the latest installment in our Walk-O-Meter.) Now to the second part of Barrett’s claim. Walker ‘caused’ job loss Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak made four points in arguing that Walker caused Wisconsin’s job losses: Economist prediction: A Wisconsin State Journal article published the same day as Barrett’s tweet noted that University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Steven Deller, in March 2011, predicted that spending cuts in Walker’s budget proposals would result in the loss of nearly 22,000 jobs in one to two years. But as Deller himself has noted, some economists believe that job losses are caused by tax increases, which Walker would have needed to balance the budget had he not relied on spending cuts. So one prediction does not make it a settled issue. Walker’s jobs bills: Walzak said Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature approved pieces of legislation that were touted as jobs bills, but the job losses indicate those policies failed. Here, too, there is no proof that the measures caused the job losses; indeed, it could be argued by Republicans that if not for the bills, the job losses in the period cited might have been worse. Walker claims credit: Walzak said Walker has touted his policies in response to good news - such as when jobs increased in a month or when the unemployment rate dropped - so he should be blamed for job losses. That’s a fair point, from the politics point of view. But just as the credit is not entirely due to an incumbent executive, neither is the blame. Indeed, in a May 2012 news article that Walzak himself sent us, Barrett said he agreed that presidents and governors get too much credit and blame for job creation, saying, "obviously, there are many, many factors." Lack of focus: Walzak said Walker’s focus has strayed from job creation to issues such as curbing collective bargaining for public employees. But that does not address how Walker has "caused" the loss of jobs over the past year. In that vein, we rated as Half True two similar, if less blunt, claims made in TV ads by the Republican Governors Association, which blamed Barrett’s policies for driving up unemployment in Milwaukee and blamed policies of Kathleen Falk, the other leading Democrat in the recall election, for doing the same in Dane County while she was the county executive. As we stated in those items, a chief executive such as a governor has influence over jobs, but so do a host of other factors, such as national trends, that are beyond a governor’s control. The national recession has certainly had a wide impact. Indeed, in 2008 and 2009, amid and immediately after the recession - while Democrat Jim Doyle was Wisconsin’s governor - the state lost 164,000 jobs, although it added 12,000 in 2010. Our rating Barrett said Walker "has caused Wisconsin to lose more jobs than any other state in the country." He is accurate on the job losses but overstates Walker’s role in causing them. We rate Barrett’s statement Half True. (You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentine's web page.)

pomt-11896	"The city (of St. Louis) is no stranger to violence. There were 5,762 violent crimes in 2015 alone, including 188 homicides. The highest rate per capita in the country, according to FBI crime statistics."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/oct/24/pete-hegseth/pete-hegseth-gives-correct-statistics-st-louis-cri/	The city of St. Louis made national headlines in September. After a judge acquitted former police officer Jason Stockley in the 2011 shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith, protests ensued. In a news segment on Sept. 17, 2017, Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth said, "The city (St. Louis) is no stranger to violence. There were 5,762 violent crimes in 2015 alone, including 188 homicides. The highest rate per capita in the country, according to FBI crime statistics." Did Hegseth get that right? We decided to find out. ‘Near the top’ Fox News did not respond to requests for comment or evidence to back up Hegseth’s claim. Experts we talked to suggested St. Louis most likely has one of the highest crime rates per capita in the country, but they didn’t give us a definitive answer. "I’m certain that St. Louis was near the top, but figuring out its exact rank requires arraying all cities of a certain size by their violent crime rate," said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. The data Hegseth cited in his claim is readily available, so we did the math ourselves. The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) collects and compares reported crime data by city, county, state and nation. A violent crime is defined as a murder, rape, robbery or aggravated assault. According to the 2015 Missouri crime statistics, there were 5,762 violent crimes and 188 murders in the city of St. Louis. We checked Hegseth’s claim by creating a new database using UCR’s data, which lists 2015 crime data for every state and city. Using cities with a population over 100,000, we calculated the rate per 100,000 people, for violent crime and homicide for each city. St. Louis had the highest violent crime rate and the highest homicide rate per 100,000 in the country in 2015, among cities with a population of 100,000 people or more. Though Hegseth referenced the 2015 data in his statement, the most recent UCR data available is from 2016. That year, St. Louis came in second for violent crimes per 100,000. Detroit ranked No. 1. We ran the same calculations on the most recent data, too. As for the homicide rate, St. Louis held its No. 1 spot in 2016. A USA Today article also breaks down the per capita statistics, citing 24/7 Wall Street. "Adjusting for population, the city’s murder and violent crime rates, at 59 murders and 1,817 per 100,000 city residents, are each the highest in the country," the article states. In cities with a population of at least 100,000 people, St. Louis had both the highest violent crime rate per capita and murder rate per capita in the country in 2015. Detroit, Michigan is directly behind St. Louis with 1,759 violent crimes per capita and 43 murders per capita. Understanding St. Louis Looking at the city of St. Louis, however, is particularly challenging, because it does not include the small suburbs near the downtown area. The city of St. Louis is independent from St. Louis County. For a previous fact-check, Sam Dotson, the ex-police chief of the St. Louis Metro Police Department, told us UCR statistics are "absolutely not" reflective of crime in the region. He said if you combined the county crime data with the city’s, St. Louis’ crime rate would drop drastically. Experts say Dotson has a point. James Alan Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University, told us previously that suburbs have a moderating effect on crime data, so crime rate can depend on whether and how many suburbs are included in the city’s jurisdiction. In this case, the city’s crime rate does not reflect any of the 90 municipalities or unincorporated parcels that make up St. Louis County. Our ruling Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth said St. Louis had the highest crime rate and highest homicide rate per capita in the country in 2015, according to UCR data. Hegseth cites the data correctly. But experts caution against using crime data to compare cities. In St. Louis’ case, its high crime rate is at least partially explained because the St. Louis suburbs are not part of the city proper. Hegseth’s claim is accurate but needs that point of clarification. That meets our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-10646	"Sen. Obama's chair in New Hampshire is a lobbyist. He lobbies for the drug companies."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/hillary-clinton/lobbyists-live-in-obamas-glass-house/	Hillary Clinton highlighted an accurate inconsistency in Barack Obama's rhetoric and reality during the Democratic debate in New Hampshire on Jan. 5, 2008, three days ahead of the state's primary. "You know, when it comes to lobbyists ... Sen. Obama's chair in New Hampshire is a lobbyist," Clinton said. "He lobbies for the drug companies." As Clinton talked, Obama shook his head no as if he disagreed. "He was shaking his head because her implication was that it violated our lobbyist pledge and his role quite clearly does not," Obama spokesman Bill Burton said afterward. The Democrat has pledged not to take money from federal lobbyists or from federal political action committees. The man on the hot seat is Jim Demers, a veteran New Hampshire strategist and early Obama supporter who is one of the campaign's four state co-chairs. In the May 20, 2007, announcement of his position, the Obama campaign kept its distance, labeling Demers a "former lobbyist" and saying he "will act in a VOLUNTARY role as part of the statewide team." And for good reason. On the campaign trail, Obama frequently assails lobbyists' influence in Washington, rejecting their campaign contributions and vowing not to let them work in his White House. (We previously found his antilobbyist policy has a few loopholes that allow him to accept money from well-connected state lobbyists.) Records at the New Hampshire secretary of state's office show Demers currently is a registered lobbyist. He is president of the Demers Group, a lobbying firm based in Concord, N.H. In fact, he filed forms Dec. 28, 2007, to lobby for 20 organizations — including drugmaker Pfizer and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). Demers, a University of Miami alum, is an experienced political player in New Hampshire. He served three terms in the state House and in 2004 was named the most influential lobbyist by PoliticsNH.com, according to biographies listed on various Web sites. Records show he is not currently a registered federal lobbyist. Confronted by Clinton's statement, the Obama campaign once again drew a line between lobbyists who seek to influence the federal government and those like Demers who work at the state level. "A ban on lobbying money and PACs is far from perfect," Robert Gibbs, Obama's communications director, said in a statement. "There is a difference between a college football player and professional football player." By noting Obama's lobbyist ties, Clinton is trying to deflect the barrage of criticism she has received for taking the most money among all presidential candidates from lobbyists and the health care industry. (Claims we previously found Mostly True .) Despite the Obama campaign's contention that there is a difference between lobbyists at the federal level and lobbyists at the state level, Clinton's charge was unspecific. It simply says Obama's chair in New Hampshire is a lobbyist. He is. We find Clinton's claim to be True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-01-06T00:00:00	2008-01-05	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-08988	"We're spending $1 trillion a year on our foreign policy."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/15/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-us-spends-1-trillion-foreign-policy/	Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sparked a political frenzy recently when he alleged that President Obama is responsible for the war in Afghanistan and questioned the prospects of a U.S. victory in the region. "Keep in mind again, federal candidates, this was a war of Obama's choosing. This was not something that the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in, but it was the president who was trying to be cute by half by building a script demonizing Iraq, while saying the battle really should be in Afghanistan. Well, if he is such a student of history, has he not understood that you know that's the one thing you don't do, is engage in a land war in Afghanistan?" said Steele. The comments prompted several calls for Steele's resignation among Republicans and conservative pundits. Steele does, however, have at least one defender: Ron Paul, an outspoken Republican representative from Texas and a former presidential candidate. Asked about the comments in a July 5, 2010, CNN interview, Paul talked about what he sees as widespread public disapproval of the war, including its detrimental financial impact on the U.S. "We're spending $1 trillion a year on our foreign policy," Paul commented. That caught our attention, so we decided to look into it. Paul's office sent us an article written by Robert Higgs, a scholar at The Independent Institute, a libertarian-leaning economic research organization. Higgs argues that looking at how much money goes to the Department of Defense is insufficient. One also has to include the appropriations for the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons program, the Department of State, the Department of Veterans affairs, and the interest payments attributable to past debt-financed defense spending, among other expenses. Crunching the numbers for 2009, Higgs came up with a total that's slightly over $1 trillion. We consulted numerous defense budget experts on the issue. They all agreed that it depends largely on how one defines "foreign policy." Changing the definition means changing the programs that one includes in the calculation, which impacts the total amount. Winslow Wheeler from the Center for Defense Information sent us a table which details the "U.S. security" expenses for 2010. The total comes out to $1021.3 billion, slightly over $1 trillion. The calculation includes the interest on the Department of Defense Retiree Health Care Fund and on debt-financed defense spending. Cindy Williams, a principal research scientist at the MIT Security Studies Program told us to check out her presentation on historical U.S. defense and foreign affairs spending trends. Looking at projected spending for the year 2010, summing up national defense programs, homeland security programs, and international affairs initiatives totals $841 billion. Add in the VA budget of $125 billion and we get $966 billion. Williams said that she wouldn't include the interest payments attributable to past debt-financed defense spending in her own analysis, "since there is no good way to judge whether debt accumulated because we spent too much on security, or because we raised too little in taxes." We also checked with Stephen Donahoe from the Friends Committee on National Legislation, an anti-war lobby. Donahoe told us that their own calculations do not include the entire State Department budget. Still, taking into account Pentagon spending and money that goes into nuclear defense programs, Veterans Affairs, interest payments on defense-related debt, and other related expenses that are scattered throughout the budget, the group arrives at about $1 trillion. The committee acknowledges on its website that the number varies across groups that track defense spending. Finally, the folks at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget crunched the numbers for us. They came up with a total of $935 billion for the year 2010 and $950 billion for 2011 based on estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. Those totals include the Department of Defense, overseas contingency operations, the State Department and other international programs, and "a few other agencies and programs typically included in a 'security' budget." Ron Paul claims that the U.S. spends $1 trillion a year on foreign policy. Our experts acknowledged that the figure largely depends on one's definition of "foreign policy." Changing the definition means altering the expenses that one includes in the calculation. There was disagreement, for example, on whether to include the interest payments on debt-financed military spending and how to calculate that debt. Still, give or take, most of the numbers that the experts threw at us come relatively close to, or even exceed, the $1 trillion mark. We find that Paul's underlying point is valid, and rate this one True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2010-07-15T12:16:12	2010-07-05	['None']
pomt-13282	Says Patrick Murphy wrongly conveyed Rubio's stance on abortion for women infected by Zika.	false	/florida/statements/2016/oct/11/marco-rubio/rubio-mischaracterizes-his-own-position-abortions-/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio misrepresented his stance on abortion for pregnant women with Zika in a new Spanish-language campaign ad trying to discredit his Democratic challenger. In the ad, released Oct. 4, 2016, a speaker says U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy "lies about Marco Rubio, when Marco has been there for us." The screen lifts an image from a prior Murphy campaign ad showing a woman standing on a beach with the words, "Marco Rubio: 'No abortions for Zika-infected women.' " It then shows Murphy with a stamped "FALSE." Murphy and groups that support abortion rights have repeatedly attacked Rubio for saying he didn’t believe in allowing abortions for pregnant women with the Zika virus, which has been linked to microcephaly in newborns. And the reason they’ve attacked him is because that’s what Rubio said. On the record In an Aug. 8, 2016, story in Politico, Rubio told reporter Marc Caputo he did not believe infected women had a right to an abortion, even if they suspected their child might be born with the birth defects associated with microcephaly. The quotation in the commercial refers to the story's headline. "I understand a lot of people disagree with my view — but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws," Rubio said. "And when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition, it’s a difficult question and a hard one. But if I’m going to err, I’m going to err on the side of life." The comments came as Congress struggled over funding emergency relief for the disease, which has spread in Florida and nationwide over the summer. Politico’s story was widely cited by other outlets afterward. Murphy and Rubio have batted attacks on Zika funding back and forth during the Senate campaign. Murphy has attacked Rubio’s stance on potential abortions in statements and a campaign ad. But this is the first time Rubio has said the Jupiter Democrat is misrepresenting him. There hasn’t been an English-language counterpart repeating Rubio’s claim. His campaign did release an ad in September accusing Murphy of not telling the truth, but that ad omitted the Zika claim. Rubio’s campaign did not respond when we asked them why they said Murphy was lying about the subject. Spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas did not specify to the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald Tallahassee bureau, either, only telling reporter Kristen Clark that Murphy has "repeatedly distorted Marco's record." Just to be sure Rubio wasn’t misquoted, we double-checked with Politico’s Caputo, who said he had ensured Rubio knew what he was going to write about the senator’s opinion. He said Rubio did not object. Caputo also noted the campaign had not disputed the story after it published. "They never said it was false," Caputo told PolitiFact Florida. "They never expressed any doubt whatsoever." Murphy’s campaign stood by their characterization of Rubio’s position. "Either Rubio is silently flip-flopping on his pro-life stance and forgot to let voters know, or he is blatantly lying in this ad," Murphy spokeswoman Galia Slayen said in a statement. Our ruling Rubio said Murphy wrongly conveyed Rubio's stance on abortion for women infected by Zika. In a Spanish-language ad, Rubio disputed the notion that he does not believe in allowing pregnant women to get an abortion if they suspect their baby may suffer from Zika-related birth defects. Rubio confirmed that stance in an August story in Politico, which Murphy has subsequently cited. Unless Rubio has changed his position, which he hasn’t stated publicly, the ad is wrong about Murphy misrepresenting Rubio’s stance. We rate the statement False. Editor's note, Oct. 17, 2016: This story has been updated to clarify the quotation. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4574bb68-c116-4562-9d5f-ac7ce20e741a	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-10-11T18:04:21	2016-10-04	['None']
pomt-06227	Says the unemployment rate for college graduates is 4.4 percent and over 10 percent for noncollege-educated.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/05/rick-santorum/did-santorums-unemployment-numbers-add-time/	So what’s a college degree worth? Apparently a lot if you want to keep your job, according to numbers relayed by one Republican running for president. Rick Santorum came to the Atlanta area last week to convince grass-roots party activists that his candidacy -- despite low poll numbers -- is ascending. The former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania castigated "Obamacare," among other topics. What caught our attention was that Santorum offered some very specific statistics on college education in relation to unemployment. "We need to create the hope and opportunity for those who in this economy have been left behind, and that’s a lot of blue-collar workers," the candidate told an audience of about 75 people at a hotel in Duluth. "The unemployment among those who are college-educated in America is 4.4 percent. Among blue-collar and noncollege-educated, it’s over 10 percent." The comments were made to the Georgia Republican Party’s 7th District Committee, which has invited the GOP candidates for president to speak. Santorum has talked about this subject before. During a Nov. 9 debate, the candidate said: "The unemployment rate among [the] noncollege-educated is well into the double digits in America. It's 4 percent or 5 percent for people who have college degrees." Our friends at PolitiFact National checked out that statement and rated it Half True. In Georgia, Santorum offered a more detailed claim. So did Santorum do better this time on the Truth-O-Meter? We used a table by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that tracks unemployment rates for Americans older than 25 by their educational level. In October, the unemployment rate for high school graduates with no college education was 9.6 percent, according to the BLS. The unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma was 13.8 percent. There was no breakdown for "blue-collar" workers. Since Santorum said "noncollege-educated," we decided to combine workers with and without high school diplomas. There are a combined 49.2 million Americans in the workforce who fit that description, according to the BLS. About 5.2 million of them are unemployed, which equals an unemployment rate of 10.6 percent. That is over 10 percent, which Santorum told the audience in Gwinnett. And what’s the unemployment rate for workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher? In October, it was 4.4 percent, according to the BLS. In this category, the numbers haven’t changed much in the past 12 months. Santorum’s numbers were on target for college-educated workers. The former senator apparently did his homework this time about the unemployment rate for noncollege-educated workers. We rate his statement True.

pomt-05620	The CBO says the cost of health care reform will rise to $1.8 trillion, "increasing the price to far greater than the $900 billion" originally projected.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/26/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-900-million-health-reform-price-t/	U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt says Americans can’t afford the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Commonly called ObamaCare, the 2010 law that expands Medicare eligibility and requires all legal U.S. residents to have some form of health care insurance. In a March 19 posting on his web site Hurt, R-5th, called the law "budget-busting." He cited a March 10 report from the Congressional Budget Office and reeled off potential problems with the reforms. "Additionally, the report projected that the cost of this health care law will increase to nearly $1.8 trillion – increasing the price to far greater than the $900 billion than was projected when it was enacted – raising costs for American taxpayers at a time when we can least afford it," he wrote. We wondered if the new CBO report really did project a 100 percent increase in the cost of health care reform. When President Barack Obama proposed the health care legislation in September 2009, he said, "Now, add it all up, and the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over 10 years -- less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration." In March 2010, the CBO calculated the gross cost at $938 billion for 2010 through 2019. But that figure did not take into account revenues the law would produce by imposing taxes on top earners, levies on high-cost insurance plans and penalties on individuals and employers who remain uninsured. The net cost of health care reform was projected at $788 billion for the decade. It’s important to remember that the law phases in over the decade. From 2010 to 2013, the CBO projected the gross and net costs of the law at less than $10 billion a year. The gross cost estimate swelled to $54 billion and the net to $49 billion for 2014, when major reforms begin, such as expanded eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, as well as subsidies for insurance exchanges. For 2019, the CBO estimated the gross cost at $214 billion and the net at $172 billion. Now, let’s look at the CBO’s latest report. It provides updated figures but looks at different years than the first study. The new gross cost is $1.762 trillion from 2012 to 2022, which Hurt accurately rounded up. The net cost is $1.252 trillion. But the total numbers are for an 11-year period, whereas the earlier report’s figures were for 10 years. And the new timespan, 2012 to 2022, adds three years at the end when reforms are fully implemented and removes two years at the beginning, when costs were minimal. So has the CBO doubled its original projections on the cost of health care reform, as Hurt suggests? We compared the years both reports have in common -- 2012 through 2019 -- and came up with these results: *The total gross cost in the first report was $931 billion, compared with $1.011 trillion in the second study. That’s an 8.6 percent increase. *The total net cost in the first report was $777 billion, compared with $772 billion in the second study. That’s an 0.6 percent decrease. Our ruling Hurt said the CBO has estimated that the cost of health care reform will rise to $1.8 trillion, "increasing the price to far greater than the $900 billion projected" when the law was signed in 2010. The Republican correctly rounded off numbers contained in two CBO reports, but then he made a misleading comparison between them. The first estimate covers a 10-year period -- from 2010 to 2019 -- including four early years when costs for the phased-in reform are minimal. The second projection covers an 11-year period -- from 2012 to 2022 -- that adds three years when the program is in full force and drops the first two low-cost years of the law. Hurt did not mention these key differences. When you compare the years the reports have in common -- 2012 to 2019 -- gross-cost projections in the the latter study are 8.6 percent higher than in the initial work. So there’s some truth in Hurt’s claim that estimates for the cost of health care reform have increased. But his statement implies he projections have doubled, and that’s plain wrong. We rate Hurt’s statement Mostly False.	None	Robert Hurt	None	None	None	2012-03-26T06:00:00	2012-03-19	['Congressional_Budget_Office']
pomt-02371	Says he has supported "George Bush more than I have Barack Obama."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/18/nick-rahall/rep-nick-rahall-west-virginia-says-he-supported-ge/	Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1976, but this fall, he will be fighting for his political life. Rahall -- whose district supported Mitt Romney over Barack Obama by a 33-percentage point margin in the 2012 presidential race -- is deemed no better than a tossup for re-election this fall against Democratic-turned-Republican state Sen. Evan Jenkins. A Republican poll in March 2014 had Jenkins up by a whopping 14 points. Given that in 2012 West Virginia gave Obama his fifth-worst showing of any state in the nation, it’s understandable that Rahall has been seeking to put some distance between himself and the president. During a March 12, 2014, interview with The Hill newspaper, Rahall said he will support Obama "when he’s good for West Virginia" and will "oppose him when he’s bad for West Virginia." Asked if Obama had been good for his state overall, Rahall said, "Probably not." He continued, "I probably have supported George Bush more than I have Barack Obama, Am I going to switch parties because of that? No. I’m a Democrat, born a Democrat, am a Democrat and will die a Democrat." Was he correct about his support for the last two presidents? We took a look. (Rahall’s office did not respond to two inquiries for this article.) So what do Rahall’s vote patterns look like? We turned to Congressional Quarterly, which has tracked House members’ voting records since the 1950s in a number of ways, including how close they are to the president's stated policy stances. Year President Rahall’s presidential support 2013 Obama 58 percent 2012 Obama 64 percent 2011 Obama 65 percent 2010 Obama 88 percent 2009 Obama 94 percent 2008 Bush 18 percent 2007 Bush 9 percent 2006 Bush 47 percent 2005 Bush 33 percent 2004 Bush 45 percent 2003 Bush 35 percent 2002 Bush 28 percent 2001 Bush 33 percent Average during Obama’s tenure 74 percent Average during Bush’s tenure 31 percent So Rahall’s memory was decidedly faulty. His "presidential support" score has been more than twice as high during Obama’s tenure than it was under George W. Bush. In fact, Rahall’s highest support score for Bush (47 percent) was lower than his lowest support for Obama (58 percent) by a double-digit margin. In the unlikely event that Rahall was referring to former President George H.W. Bush, we checked that possibility as well. As it turned out, Rahall’s average presidential support for the elder Bush was even lower -- 30 percent. Christopher Plein, an associate professor in the public administration department of West Virginia University, said that while it is important to look at the raw metrics, it’s also important to look at the substance of the votes themselves. He said that on issues of urgent importance to his constituents, such as regulations that are perceived to be a threat to coal mining, Rahall has not been hesitant to vote at cross purposes to Obama. "My sense is that you would find Rep. Rahall’s positions showing variation across policy areas that might not align with common assumptions about Democratic stances on these matters," Plein said. However, while Rahall's level of voting support for Obama was lower than it was for all but 10 other Democrats in 2013, even that weak level of support is more than 27 percentage points higher than the most pro-Obama Republican in the House -- Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina, who supported Obama about 31 percent of the time in 2013. So it's a stretch for Rahall to portray his voting record as being virtually Republican. Our ruling Rahall said, "I probably have supported George Bush more than I have Barack Obama." He’s wrong: According to Congressional Quarterly, his average voting support for Obama has been 74 percent, compared to just 31 percent for George W. Bush, and his weakest support for Obama exceeded his strongest support for Bush by double digits. We rate his claim False.

Featured prominently near the top was a graphic that touted job gains on Trump’s watch. The graphic said, "Over 500,000 new jobs -- with a surge in female employment last month." Is that accurate? Not exactly. 'Over 500,000 new jobs' The number of new jobs does exceed 500,000 if you include the monthly job reports from January, February, and March -- the most recent three months for which data has been released. The net gain in jobs over that period was 533,000. However, there’s a problem with Trump claiming credit for all 533,000 jobs -- namely, the January report isn’t based on job gains that occurred on his watch. "The jobs report is a snapshot reflecting conditions in the calendar week or pay period that includes the 12th of the month," said Jed Kolko, chief economist with the jobs site Indeed. Since Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, "the information in the January report preceded President Trump's first 100 days," Kolko said. Using just the two months on his watch -- February and March -- the U.S. economy created 317,000 jobs, not 500,000. A fair approximation, Kolko said, would be to include job growth reported in the February, March, and April reports. But the April jobs report hasn’t been released, so we don’t know the final number yet. For the sake of comparison, overall job creation under Trump actually hasn’t been turbo-charged yet. The average monthly gain for February and March -- the two months for which we currently have data for Trump -- was 158,500. By contrast, the average monthly gain for Obama’s final full year -- January 2016 to December 2016 -- was 187,000. Here’s a chart showing monthly job gains since January 2016. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "Job gains so far this year are not exceptional by the standards of job growth in the recent past," said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. "My assessment is that not much has happened so far in the job market, in either a favorable or unfavorable direction, since the start of the year." We’ll also add our usual caveat that that no president deserves full credit or full blame for economic performance on their watch, since no president is powerful enough to singlehandedly shape the economy. Other forces, from technological advances to developments overseas, can have significant effects. 'A surge in female employment last month' As for the "surge" in female employment, there is evidence in the statistics, but it’s not clear how significant or durable the increase is. The number of employed women rose by 475,000 between February 2017 and March 2017. That’s bigger than all but one month-over-month increase in 2016, when Obama was in office, and it followed a January-to-February increase of 319,000. There’s uncertainty, however, about what, if anything this means. For starters, most economists warn that it’s vastly preferable to draw conclusions from more than one month. One month’s statistics could be thrown off balance by random quirks; this shortcoming would dissipate if you looked at a longer run of months. In addition, the month-to-month data for men’s and women’s employment tends to bounce around -- a lot. During the final full year of Obama’s presidency, the monthly change in women’s employment ranged from a decline of 179,000 to an increase of 487,000, and the monthly change in men’s employment ranged from a decline of 94,000 to an increase of 402,000. This is part of why economists favor a different Bureau of Labor Statistics measurement for month-to-month changes in employment -- a survey of company payroll records, rather than of households. The payroll-survey data did not vary as widely under Obama in 2016 -- it ranged from a gain of 43,000 to a gain of 291,000. Indeed, the payroll data showed a gain of 98,000 jobs in March, which doesn’t align at all with the supposed 475,000-job increase for women seen in the household survey. It’s also worth noting that the March gain for women was partially offset by a loss of 5,000 jobs for men. "We’ll have to wait a while longer before knowing whether the big March employment gains for women are significant or sustainable," Burtless said. "Most informed observers agree that the month-to-month and even two-month employment changes recorded in the household survey seem awfully variable compared with the numbers in the employer survey." Our ruling Trump said he created "over 500,000 new jobs -- with a surge in female employment last month." Actually, he can stake a claim for a boost of 317,000 jobs at most, not 500,000 -- and that comes with the usual caveats about how much credit presidents deserve for job growth during their tenure. Meanwhile, the data does show a two-month surge in female employment, but it’s too soon to know whether this is a lasting achievement or just statistical noise. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-08249	Has created 60,000 net new jobs since taking office.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/12/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-has-gained-60000-jobs-/	It’s all about jobs, Gov. Bob McDonnell says. During an Election Day interview, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough hailed McDonnell as the "Elvis" of the job creation message that moved voters this fall. "You started this in 2009 before anyone got this," Scarborough told the governor, referring to McDonnell’s pledge to create jobs during his successful campaign last year. McDonnell replied that since taking office in January, "we’ve been able to create about 60,000 net new jobs" in Virginia. We checked the governor’s claim. Stacey Johnson, McDonnell’s press secretary, said the number comes from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our next call went to the office of Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who heads McDonnell’s jobs team. Randy Marcus, Bolling’s chief of staff, compiles the job-creation figures for the administration. Marcus said he takes the most current BLS monthly figure for non-farm jobs in Virginia. Then he subtracts the number of non-farm jobs in Virginia in February, McDonnell’s first full month in office. The remainder is what the administration considers to be Virginia’s net job gain under McDonnell. It encompasses full and part-time jobs in the public and private sectors. We ran the computation, based on the latest BLS numbers that had been posted more than a week before McDonnell’s appearance on MSNBC. Here’s our result: Virginia Workers, Sept. 2010 3,637,200 Virginia Workers, Feb. 2010 3,581,800 Net job gain under McDonnell 55,400 The governor’s claim of creating about 60,000 new jobs was a tad inflated, but certainly in the ballpark. In July, McDonnell claimed 71,500 new Virginia jobs had been created since he took office. We checked those numbers and found them dead on. Much of the job loss since then can be attributed to the layoff of federal census workers. McDonnell also said on MSNBC that only Texas has gained more jobs than Virginia since February. He’s right, according to BLS statistics. Texas has added 128,800 jobs since February. Virginia has experienced a 1.55 percent increase in jobs since February. That ranks sixth, with the District of Columbia leading everyone with 2.38 percent growth. McDonnell’s statement "we’ve" created about 60,000 jobs suggests all the new slots are the result of his administration’s actions. "It’s not unique to the Governor, but it bothers me how all politicians take credit for creating jobs," said John Knapp, senior economist for the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at The University of Virginia. "Barack Obama is not president of the economy and Bob McDonnell is not governor of the economy. Of course, what they do can have a marginal effect on things, but there are many other elements involved in creating jobs." Cooper added that state policies affect job creation development over the long run. "But as year or two out, new state policies are not going to have a major impact on the economy." Johnson said it is not the McDonnell’s intention to claim credit for all new jobs under his watch. "It’s a cumulative effort," she said. It’s the private sector that creates jobs; government can merely help set a conducive climate." Johnson said that when McDonnell said "we’ve" created about 60,000 net new jobs, "he was referring to Virginia." So let’s review. Has Virginia created "about 60,000 new jobs" since McDonnell came to office, as the governor claimed on Nov. 2? It depends how you measure "about." The correct number at the time was 55,400. The governor was a little bit off, but he wasn’t blowing smoke. For that reason, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2010-11-12T18:00:00	2010-11-02	['None']
pomt-08175	Obama's position on nuclear arms is a "march toward global zero."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/30/jon-kyl/sen-jon-kyl-says-obama-nuclear-arms-police-march-z/	In a discussion of the new START treaty on NBC's Meet the Press on Nov. 29, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) outlined several reservations he has with the proposed treaty to control nuclear arms. Kyl said he had concerns with provisions related to such things as missile defense and modernization of the nuclear arsenal. But more than that, Kyl said he has a major philosophical difference with President Barack Obama's administration with regard to arms control -- namely whether the goal should be for a world free from all nuclear weapons. "You have questions extraneous to the treaty but within the context, which is, is this all that's standing between us today and the administration trying to negotiate even deeper, further cuts, which it's indicated that it wants to do in its march toward global zero, something that a lot of us disagree with," Kyl said. We looked into several comments made by Kyl about the new START treaty, but here, we are weighing whether it's accurate to characterize the Obama administration's position on nuclear arms as a "march toward global zero." There's little question that Obama's stated goal -- even before he became president -- has consistently been a world free of nuclear weapons. Some examples: * A presidential campaign position paper on foreign policy promised that Obama "will make the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide a central element of U.S. nuclear policy." * In his defining speech on nuclear weapons as president, Obama on April 5, 2009, told an audience in Prague, "So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons." * And in remarks at the United Nations Security Council Summit on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Disarmament on Sept. 24, 2009, Obama said, "The historic resolution we just adopted enshrines our shared commitment to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. And it brings Security Council agreement on a broad framework for action to reduce nuclear dangers as we work toward that goal." In that United Nations speech, Obama quoted former President Ronald Reagan, who said, "A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. And no matter how great the obstacles may seem, we must never stop our efforts to reduce the weapons of war. We must never stop until all -- we must never stop at all until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of the Earth." "That is our task," Obama said. "That can be our destiny. And we will leave this meeting with a renewed determination to achieve this shared goal." So there is no debate that a "march toward global zero" has been Obama's stated goal. But just how fast does Obama plan to march? In every case, Obama's statements about working toward a world without nuclear weapons are closely followed by a major qualification: "America will not disarm unilaterally," Obama stated in the campaign literature. "Indeed, as long as states retain nuclear weapons, the U.S. will maintain a nuclear deterrent that is strong, safe, secure and reliable." "I'm not naive," Obama said in Prague. "This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, 'Yes, we can.'" That's why, in 2008, PolitiFact gave a False rating to a claim in a chain e-mail that Obama wants to "unilaterally disarm our nation." In fact, Obama's nuclear policy closely mirrors that espoused by George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn in two opinion pieces published in the Wall Street Journal in 2007 and 2008. In the second piece, titled "Toward a Nuclear-Free World," they wrote that, "Progress must be facilitated by a clear statement of our ultimate goal. Indeed, this is the only way to build the kind of international trust and broad cooperation that will be required to effectively address today's threats. Without the vision of moving toward zero, we will not find the essential cooperation required to stop our downward spiral. In some respects, the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons is like the top of a very tall mountain. From the vantage point of our troubled world today, we can't even see the top of the mountain, and it is tempting and easy to say we can't get there from here. But the risks from continuing to go down the mountain or standing pat are too real to ignore. We must chart a course to higher ground where the mountaintop becomes more visible." The authors have significant foreign policy experience: Shultz was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan; Perry was defense secretary under Bill Clinton; Kissinger was secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford; and Nunn was chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. And their policy was supported by numerous foreign policy experts at the time. But not all. Some foreign policy experts argued that their proposal would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement. Kyl's statement about Obama's "march toward global zero" may have been a bit of a bumper sticker slogan, but it was also "completely accurate" and an "unusually candid" assessment of the differing philosophies on nuclear arms reduction, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security. "There are two different churches that people go to on this issue," Pike said. "I think Kyl worships at the church that nuclear weapons are a good thing," he said. Kyl's position is that nuclear weapons can't be uninvented, he said, and that the U.S. wouldn't be as safe without them. "And that's not the church that Mr. Obama attends." Some may argue over how quickly Obama intends to "march toward global zero" -- Obama has said he's not even sure it's possible in his lifetime. Obama has always noted that as long as other countries retain nuclear weapons, the United States will maintain a strong nuclear arsenal. Nonetheless, Obama has consistently and repeatedly stated that his ultimate goal is to enact policies that bring the world closer to his ultimate goal: a world without nuclear weapons. And so we rate Kyl's statement Mostly True.	None	Jon Kyl	None	None	None	2010-11-30T16:47:12	2010-11-28	['None']
pomt-06881	"Harry Reid’s plan is basically giving the president a blank check."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/29/eric-cantor/cantor-says-reid-debt-proposal-gives-blank-check-o/	In a recent television interview, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor boldly predicted that Republicans in his chamber would unite to pass Speaker John Boehner’s plan to lift the nation’s debt ceiling. Cantor, R-7th, said House Republicans were concluding that Boehner’s plan is their best option to cut federal spending while ensuring, at least temporarily, that the U.S. continues to pay back its loans. Cantor dismissed as "unacceptable" the option of not increasing the $14.3 trillion debt limit by Aug. 2, when the nation will start running short of funds to pay its obligations. He was scornful of a proposal by Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to raise the debt limit. "Harry Reid’s plan is basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants," Cantor said during a July 26 interview on Fox News. We wondered whether Reid’s plan really would present President Barack Obama a blank check -- a claim repeatedly made by Cantor and Boehner. First, a little background. Reid’s proposal would raise the debt ceiling by $2.7 trillion, enough to last until 2013. Boehner’s two-step plan would allow the limit to increase by $900 billion now and force Obama to seek a second hike before next year’s elections. Both proposals claim to cut spending by $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Neither plan seeks a tax increase. Boehner would require Congress to vote on a balanced budget amendment; Reid would not. We asked asked Megan Whittemore, Cantor’s deputy press secretary, to explain the majority leader’s factual basis for calling Reid’s plan "a blank check" for Obama. "We are confident that your readers will understand the common meaning of the metaphor of a `blank check,’" she e-mailed back to us. "However, to help you along we first turn to About.com in the grammar section where you will find the following helpful." Whittemore pasted in a three-paragraph definition that began, "A figure of speech is a rhetorical device that achieves a special effect by using words in distinctive ways." It said, among other things, that sometimes people rely on "hyperbole to emphasize a point (`I’m starving!’)." She also sent us two definitions of "blank check." One, by Dictionary.com, defines it as "unrestricted authority; a free hand." Another, by Wikipedia, says blank check "in the figurative or metaphoric sense, is used (especially in politics) to describe a situation in which an agreement had been made that is open-ended or vague, and therefore subject to abuse." Whittemore noted that Boehner’s two-step plan would require Congress to hit spending-cut goals before Obama could ask Congress for the second increase in the debt. That, Republicans say, would put more pressure on Washington to reduce spending than Reid’s proposal, which would allow a larger, longer-lasting hike in the debt cap. We ran Cantor’s "blank check" analogy by four Washington policy analysts who are closely watching the debt ceiling debate. They were all perplexed by the statement and pointed out a simple reason why Reid’s plan would not give Obama carte blanche: Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can appropriate money. "Congress has to authorize new spending and changes in taxation," said Norman J. Ornstein, a political scientist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "The president can sign or veto those bills. He can’t do anything without congressional authority." Ornstein added, "Cantor is being totally, deliberately misleading." Steve Ellis, vice-president of the non-partisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, had a similar take. "Rep. Cantor’s comment isn’t really correct," he said. We were also given a second reason why Cantor’s statement is inaccurate: Raising the debt limit will pay for past obligations made by the U.S. government, not new ones. "The need to raise the debt limit is a factor of past spending and tax decision (in addition to the recent economic downturn) enacted by previous congresses and presidents pushing borrowing needs up," said Jason Peuquet, an analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road, budget-hawk group. Let’s review: Cantor said Senate Majority Leader Reid’s proposal to raise the debt ceiling would be "basically giving the president a blank check, giving him what he wants, a blind increase of the debt ceiling to spend the money the way he wants." A number of policy analysts told us Cantor’s statement is simply incorrect. Only Congress can appropriate money. Obama can only spend what he’s given. Reid’s plan does not change that constitutional requirement. Cantor’s office failed to provide a single fact to back the Republican’s contention that Reid’s proposal would give the president a free hand in spending. Cantor’s spokeswoman said he was speaking metaphorically and people understand that. We find that logic hard to accept, particularly at a time of great public divide when the financial integrity of the nation is at stake. We rate Cantor’s statement False.

"Obama did in fact unconstitutionally spy on Trump throughout the presidential election," stated a Feb. 1 article by The Global Headlines, a fake news website that bashes Democrats. The clickbait article declares at the conclusion: "Share this story if you want to see Obama behind bars for the rest of his treasonous life!" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no evidence that Obama is poised to be indicted or that he wiretapped Trump. A similar, shorter version of this story appeared on freedomnewscenter.com in September and follows a pattern of fake news stories over the past year that said that Obama wiretapped Trump’s phones during the election. Some photos included a doctored photo of Obama in handcuffs in court. On March 4, 2017, Trump tweeted that Obama ordered surveillance on him during the election. As we explained following his tweets, it’s possible the Trump White House is privy to investigative activities that aren’t in the public record. However, it appeared more likely that Trump took several media reports about legitimate intelligence investigations into his associates’ possible Russia ties and wove them into a new, unsubstantiated theory that Obama himself did something illegal. The New York Times and Washington Post reported — based on anonymous sources — that FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department to publicly refute Trump’s tweets because they wrongly imply the FBI broke the law. Additionally, an Obama spokesman has categorically denied that the Obama White House ordered any wiretapping. The Global Headlines story focused on comments by former CIA analyst and retired Army Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, who was interviewed following Trump’s tweets. Shaffer, who is frequently interviewed on Fox News and works for the conservative London Center for Policy Research, told Newsweek in 2016 that the incoming Trump administration asked him to apply for a job. The Global Headlines mentioned a "recent" interview by Shaffer on the radio show "Trending Today USA," but that interview was actually 11 months ago. The interviewer asked Shaffer if Obama should be arrested: "This could be first time a former president could be indicted for a felony, because I think that it’s very possible that he acted outside the scope of his duties, responsibilities and authorities to turn the resources of a nation’s state on a candidate," he said in a clip of the interview. "This is, as I said before, Soviet dictator-level wrongdoing." There is no evidence that Obama himself ordered wiretapping to spy on Trump during the election and is now headed toward an indictment. Trump tweeted in 2017 that Obama had ordered surveillance on him. While there have been media reports about intelligence investigations into Trump’s associates’ possible Russia ties, there is no proof that Obama himself ordered wiretapping of Trump.

abbc-00116	With five by-elections slated for July 28, the Coalition has been spruiking its achievements and vision for the country, including freshly legislated personal income tax cuts.	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-25/fact-check-is-the-government-spending-record-amounts-on-health/9989808	Mr Turnbull's claim is a fair call. Spending on health was higher in 2016-17 than in any other year since at least 1985-86. The final budget outcome is not yet available for 2017-18, but on the most recent estimate spending on health was higher again. However, that year's health funding was boosted by a number of one-off items in the budget, including nearly $1 billion in retrospective adjustments or top-ups for underspending on public hospitals in previous years, chiefly in 2015-16. Then, in 2018-19, the financial year now underway, the most recent estimate shows health spending will decrease slightly from the previous year — though it will drop by less than the 2017-18 top-up amount. Looking at this term of office overall, spending in each of the three years on health is or is estimated to be higher than the previous record set in 2015-16. This is also the case when measured in spending per person. The picture is similar for public hospitals: higher spending in both 2016-17 and 2017-18 — including the retrospective adjustment — and then a dip forecast for 2018-19. Again, this is also the case when measured in spending per person. However, the later numbers are only estimates and, as the adjustment in 2017-18 shows, they are open to change. One expert told Fact Check that the budget figures might be underestimates, and noted that spending on Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not under the Government's control, but depends on patient demand. Taking into account differences in how the various data sources report spending, Mr Turnbull can justifiably say federal spending on both health and hospitals was expected to reach a fresh peak around the time he made the claim. But while that sounds impressive, "record spending" is a claim most governments could make. That's because funding almost always increases from the previous year. In fact, between 1985-86 and 2015-16, total health funding went backwards only once — or, in per capita terms, just four times. Between 1989-90 and 2015-16, total spending on hospitals by the Commonwealth decreased six times, or eight times on a per capita basis. Of these, the two largest decreases (2009-10 and 2012-13) came immediately after the largest relative increases.

pomt-01937	"NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/25/steve-doocy/foxs-doocy-nasa-fudged-data-make-case-global-warmi/	On climate change, Gallup pollsters say Americans divide into three groups -- the "Concerned Believers," the "Mixed Middle," and the "Cool Skeptics." Believers have a slender plurality at 39 percent but skeptics make up a solid 25 percent. They think there’s little to worry about and that media reports on the topic are exaggerated. Fox News host Steve Doocy gave the doubters some ammunition on June 24, 2014. In a segment on Fox and Friends called "News by the Numbers," Doocy drew viewers’ attention to the year 1934. "That's the hottest year on record in the United States," Doocy said. "At least until NASA scientists fudged the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of global warming. The 1930s were by far the hottest decade in the United States." A reader wondered if NASA really did cook the books (we love reader suggestions!), so we are checking Doocy’s claim about fudging the numbers. We asked Fox News for their source and while they didn’t respond, a number of conservative news outlets have made much in recent days of a blog post from a man who writes under the pseudonym Steven Goddard. Goddard charged that until 2000, NASA reported that in the United States, 1934 was hotter than 1998 and that the country has been cooling since then. "Right after the year 2000, NASA and NOAA dramatically altered U.S. climate history, making the past much colder and the present much warmer," Goddard wrote. He provided this animated chart to prove his point (the chart marked "a" is the old version): Climate science experts say not so fast Doocy exaggerated the findings in this blog post when he applied it to global warming. The post itself only talks about U.S. land temperatures and what happens in the United States is separate from global shifts. As far as what the blog actually claimed, while it accurately copied the changes in the government charts, experts in U.S. temperature measurement say it ignores why the charts shifted. There were major changes in how the country gathered temperature information over the decades. Zeke Hausfather is a data scientist with Berkeley Earth, a research group that has expressed doubts about some of the reports on climate change coming from Washington and international bodies. Hausfather took Goddard to task when Goddard made a similar claim about numbers fudging earlier this month. The missing piece in Goddard’s analysis, Hausfather said, was he ignored that the network of weather stations that feed data to the government today is not the one that existed 80 years ago. "He is simply averaging absolute temperatures," Hausfather wrote. "Absolute temperatures work fine if and only if the composition of the station network remains unchanged over time." Weather stations that once were in a valley might now be on a hill top and vice versa. But the shift could be greater than simple elevation. Stations were moved from one part of a state to another. The number of stations within a given area shifted. All these differences, Hausfather and other experts said, will alter the typical temperatures gathered by government meteorologists. Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said the raw data used in the blog post suffered from an equally troubling flaw. The temperatures were not measured at the same time of day. "Over time, the U.S. network went from recording max/min temperatures at different points of the day, to doing it at midnight," Schmidt said. In fact, volunteers staffed many of the stations. Before 1940, most followed Weather Service guidelines and recorded the temperature at sundown. Through the second half of the century, there was a gradual shift to recording morning temperatures. This change produced the appearance of a cooling trend when none existed. Comparing apples to apples Better instruments and more consistent methods have allowed scientists to collect more reliable data. But for climate studies, long-term trends are key and the challenge has been how to make the best use of the older readings. In the mid 1980s, the government settled on a list of about 1,200 stations across the country to track temperature trends. Around 1990, climatologists began delivering computer programs to factor in the artificial changes that systematically pushed the readings one way or the other. Over time, they accounted for the impacts of equipment, location, the time of day of measurements and urbanization (more asphalt leads to higher surface temperatures). There is no question that running the raw data through these programs changes the graphs of average temperatures. However, multiple researchers from a variety of institutions have fed into this process and come up with their own computer models. Results from different teams largely match up. John Nielsen-Gammon is a researcher at Texas A&M University and is the Texas state climatologist. Nielsen-Gammon finds nothing nefarious in the government analysis of temperature trends. "It is reasonable to expect the adjusted data record to change over time as the technology for identifying and removing artificial changes improves," Nielsen-Gammon said. "If there are any biases, they are caused by the quality of the underlying data, not by any biases intentionally introduced into the adjustment process." All of the experts we reached or whose work we read rejected Goddard’s conclusions. Mark C. Serreze, professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder, said no fabrication has taken place. "Goddard's results stem from an erroneous analysis of the data," Serreze said. Anthony Watts, a popular skeptic of most climate change data, posted his objection to Goddard’s claim. "I took Goddard to task over this as well in a private email, saying he was very wrong and needed to do better," Watts wrote. Our ruling Doocy with Fox News said NASA scientists fudged the numbers to overstate the extent of global warming. This exaggerated the thrust in the underlying blog post. It accused government scientists of altering the U.S. temperature record, not the record for the entire earth. As for what the blog said, we found that experts across the spectrum found fundamental flaws in its analytic methods. By relying on raw data, it ignored that the number and location of weather stations and the methods of measuring temperatures across the United States have changed greatly over the past 80 years. The experts we reached or whose work we read generally agree that the corrections for flawed data produce valid results. The bare bones approach used in the blog post provides no solution to the issues of weaknesses in the raw data. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-13515	California’s Prop 60, which would require condom use in adult films, would put "workers in the adult film industry at risk for lawsuits and harassment."	half-true	/california/statements/2016/sep/02/no-60-campaign-against-condom-requirement-adult-fi/would-californias-prop-60-expose-adult-film-perfor/	Opponents of California’s Proposition 60 — which requires adult film performers to wear condoms — say it’s not the protective measure it’s touted to be. "This law pretends to protect workers in the adult film industry, but in fact it's putting them at risk for lawsuits and harassment," says a recent advertisement on YouTube by the No on 60 campaign. The claim at the center of this fact check is at the :40 minute mark. That ad was paid for by Californians Against Worker Harassment which was founded by the Free Speech Coalition, a trade association for the adult entertainment industry, to oppose Prop 60. We wondered: Does Prop 60 — a measure intended to curb sexually transmitted diseases among porn workers — really expose those same people to legal action? We decided to fact-check that provocative claim. Our research Here’s some background on Prop 60 before we jump into the claim about lawsuits. California law has required condom use in adult films since 1992. Supporters of Prop 60 say the initiative would strengthen the existing law, which they say is rarely enforced. The measure is sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has long pushed for greater safety standards in adult films. In 2012, voters in Los Angeles County approved a similar condom requirement for adult films made in that county. It is considered a model for Prop 60, which applies its condom mandate to scenes with anal and vaginal intercourse. Prop 60 would also require adult film companies to obtain a health license and pay for the costs of vaccinations and health tests for sexually transmitted diseases for their performers. We asked the No on 60 campaign for evidence backing up its claim that performers would be open to lawsuits under the measure. A spokesman pointed to the initiative’s section 6720.6, on enforcement, whistleblowers and private rights of action. It allows those who witness violations of the proposed law -- including performers, prosecutors or anyone who is a California resident -- to file a complaint with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. If the agency declines to pursue the case within 21 days, the witness could then file a civil lawsuit against anyone with a financial interest in the film, which could include some performers. There’s no mention in the No on 60 advertisement, however, that only performers with a financial interest would be liable. Nor does the ad mention the complaint process that must precede a lawsuit. Robert Elyov / Flickr More porn workers with financial stake Still, opponents of the measure say making performers liable is significant because many have a financial stake in the content. "You see, in today’s adult film industry, the majority of performers are also producers," Eric Paul Leue, executive director of the Free Speech Coalition, wrote in an opinion piece about Prop 60 in the Advocate, a LGBT news publication, this month. "In addition to shooting for studios, most porn stars regularly create their own content -- either for their own websites, on webcams, or in partnership with studios." Prop 60 would apply to any commercial pornography produced in California, in traditional films and on the web. Dr. Chauntelle Tibbals, a sociologist who studies the adult film industry, said the percentage of workers who have a financial stake in adult content they contribute to "is certainly very high," though she said there’s no accepted estimate. Advances in technology and distribution, she said, have allowed more workers to share in the financial success of their content. "Everyone from webcam models to agents may have a financial stake in a single piece of content," Tibbals added. Supporters of Prop 60, however, maintain the claim about workers being exposed to lawsuits is deceptive. "The only people who can get sued (under Prop 60) are producers," said Rick Taylor, who manages the Yes on 60 campaign. "Some actors and actresses are producers. If they’re breaking the law, they’re going to potentially get sued." Taylor said the measure’s goal is to bolster worker protections and public health, and that it doesn’t matter what percentage of performers have a financial stake in the films. Our ruling Opponents of California’s Prop 60, which would require condom use in adult films, recently claimed it would put "workers in the adult film industry at risk for lawsuits and harassment." The statement is partially accurate: Some adult film workers, and perhaps a growing share, could face lawsuits if they have a financial interest in the content they work on. But Prop 60 does not specify what constitutes a financial interest. Ultimately, it may be up to the courts to decide. Importantly, the claim by the opponents makes no mention that only workers with a monetary stake in the films would be liable and only after a complaint process plays out. Those who are independent contractors would face no legal action. The statement leaves out this key context and gives the impression that any or all workers could face lawsuits. We rate the claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-02646	Obama unilaterally announced he was delaying employer mandate "through a blog post by a mid-level bureaucrat at the Department of Treasury."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/16/ted-cruz/blog-posts-broke-news-administration-was-delaying-/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz sees a "consistent pattern of lawlessness from this president and this administration"-- unilaterally altering laws and choosing which to enforce, Cruz said in Austin on Jan. 10, 2014. One example, the Texas Republican said, came last summer, when President Barack Obama delayed by a year the Obamacare law’s requirement that companies with 50 or more employees provide coverage to their workers. "The president’s a big fan of saying, ‘It’s the law of the land. We need to follow the law of the land.’ Oh, really? Let’s see, that law of the land says on Jan. 1, 2014, the employer mandate shall kick in for big business," Cruz said at a Texas Public Policy Foundation conference. "And yet the president just announced unilaterally, ‘No, we’re not enforcing this. I’m granting an exemption to all of big business.’ And by the way, this was done -- was this done through a big formal announcement, through an address to the American people: ‘There’s a problem in this law; we’re going to have to change it’? "No. It was done through a blog post by a mid-level bureaucrat at the Department of Treasury on July 3, right before the Fourth of July break." We’re not getting into whether laws were broken; not our purview. But we wondered if Cruz accurately captured how the change was revealed. Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton told us by email that Cruz was referring to a July 2, 2013, blog entry on Treasury.gov attributed to Mark Mazur, assistant secretary for tax policy. The post said, "The administration is announcing that it will provide an additional year before the ACA mandatory employer and insurer reporting requirements begin." News coverage that day said the Treasury and White House websites broke the news. The New York Times reported: In a significant setback for President Barack Obama's signature domestic initiative, the administration on Tuesday abruptly announced a one-year delay, until 2015, in his health care law's mandate that larger employers provide coverage for their workers or pay penalties. The decision postpones the effective date beyond next year's midterm elections. Employer groups welcomed the news of the concession, which followed complaints from businesses and was posted late in the day on the White House and Treasury websites while the president was flying home from Africa. The Washington Post’s Wonkblog said: The Obama administration will not penalize businesses that do not provide health insurance in 2014, the Treasury Department announced Tuesday. … "We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively," Mark Mazur, Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, wrote in a late Tuesday blog post. In a July 3, 2013, news story, Bloomberg News described the White House website announcement: Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, said in a blog post announcing the move that the administration decided on the delay so officials could simplify reporting requirements and give employers a chance to adjust their health-care coverage. Some months later, it looks to us like the Treasury announced the change shortly before the White House did. Jarrett’s post is time-stamped 6 p.m. Eastern; the Treasury blog entry does not have a time stamp. But the earliest news accounts we saw solely cited the Treasury post: the Washington Post news blog entry, stamped 5:51 p.m., a Business Insider news story stamped 5:41 p.m., and a Huffington Post item stamped 5:50 p.m. Eastern. With the announcements, the government put in motion one-year delays for businesses to report certain information to the IRS and related penalties. The Obamacare law, approved in 2010, essentially requires affected employers and other health coverage providers to report whether their insurance plans meet the law’s minimum coverage standards and whether employees are enrolled in them. There were more notification steps: A July 9, 2013, IRS notice formalized the change, and Treasury and the IRS published proposed versions of the rules for comment Sept. 9, 2013, in the Federal Register. When we called in January 2014, IRS spokesman Eric Smith told us by phone that the final rules had not yet been issued. Debate has swirled over whether the administration had the authority to unilaterally make this change. Rushton emailed us a link to a July 8, 2013, blog post by the libertarian Cato Institute saying the Affordable Care Act gives Treasury the authority to collect penalties, not to waive them or the reporting requirements. In contrast, a Treasury official told a House subcommittee on July 17, 2013, that the department generally may delay effective dates in some circumstances -- such as easing the transition to new requirements -- because of a law stating the IRS can "prescribe all needful rules and regulations" to enforce relevant laws. So: The news was announced on two government blogs. And was the originator a mid-level bureaucrat? John Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that studies the federal workforce, told us by email, "The assistant secretary for tax policy is far from a mid-level Department of Treasury employee. "Of the approximately 2.1 million civilian employees in the executive branch of government (not counting the Postal Service), Mr. Mazur is one of only 1,217 Senate-confirmed, political employees in government paid at executive-level IV," which in 2013 was $155,500 a year. On the other hand, a University of North Carolina constitutional law professor who wrote a book on federal appointments told us by email, "He could be described as ‘mid-level’ but, because he is Senate-confirmed, not a bureaucrat. "Under the Constitution, officials requiring Senate confirmation are thought of as officers of the U.S." – a term, Michael Gerhardt said, that "has been defined by the Supreme Court as someone who wields some substantial policymaking authority." A bureaucrat "sounds as if it is someone who does not have much authority or discretion," he said. Gerhardt said "mid-level" typically means "ranking somewhere within the middle of the hierarchy of the department. It is not unusual for Senate-confirmable officials to be in such posts." Our ruling Cruz said that Obama unilaterally announced he was delaying the employer mandate "through a blog post by a mid-level bureaucrat at the Department of Treasury." The announcement was also made on a White House blog, and "mid-level bureaucrat" isn’t necessarily accurate. We rate his statement as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. Correction, 4:10 p.m. Jan. 21, 2014: We revised this story, which originally overstated the salary of executive-level IV government employees. This correction did not affect our rating of the claim.

pomt-03477	"It's expressly prohibited by law that you can read and wholly surveil domestic email traffic in the United States."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/13/mike-rogers/rep-mike-rogers-says-its-expressly-prohibited-law-/	So, is the NSA reading your email? News reports from the Guardian and the Washington Post in June raised questions about just what data the National Security Agency collects about Americans, and how it’s used. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who chairs the House committee that oversees intelligence agencies, argues the data-collection programs are effective and operate under strict limits. "The National Security Agency does not listen to Americans' phone calls and it is not reading Americans' emails. None of these programs allow that," he told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s Sunday talk show This Week. "As a matter of fact, the Patriot Act, part of that, 702, says it's expressly prohibited by law that you can read and wholly surveil domestic email traffic in the United States." With new, leaked information swirling about broad data collection under secret court orders, we wondered: Does the law expressly prohibit the government from reading and engaging in surveillance of Americans’ domestic email? The news Rogers was responding to discussion prompted by leaks from Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old former NSA contractor who left his job in Hawaii for Hong Kong. Rogers mentioned both phone calls and emails. While we’re focusing on his claim about American email, it’s helpful to understand that Snowden’s leaks revealed details about two separate programs that function under different areas of the law. First, a June 5 story in the Guardian by Glenn Greenwald disclosed a secret court order requiring Verizon to turn over "all call detail records" on an "ongoing daily basis," such as phone numbers and length of calls — but not their content. Second, stories published June 6 by the Washington Post and the Guardian revealed top-secret PowerPoint slides that describe a data-collection program code-named Prism. The slides, dated April 2013, outline a program to collect email, chats, videos, photos, stored data and files from nine technology and social media companies, including Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Apple. The programs are authorized under different — but related — pieces of legislation, both tied in some way to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, or FISA. The phone-records order relies on U.S. Code amended by Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which updated provisions of FISA. By contrast, the Prism program falls under FISA’s Section 702, according to a response to news articles from the director of national intelligence, a part of the law added in 2008. Rogers had mentioned both the "Patriot Act" and "702." We asked Rogers’ office what part of the law he was talking about when he said it’s "expressly prohibited" to "read and wholly surveil domestic email traffic in the United States." The communications director for the House intelligence committee clarified he was talking about FISA’s Section 702. (The section was added by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, renewed under President Barack Obama in December 2012, so Rogers misspoke when he mentioned the Patriot Act.) Section 702 allows the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to authorize targeting of people "reasonably believed to be outside the United States" for "foreign intelligence information." Under the section’s provisions, the government isn’t allowed to "intentionally target" citizens or people inside the United States, or to target someone outside the country for the purpose of getting information about a specific person who’s in the U.S. Committee spokeswoman Susan Phalen highlighted, in particular, the requirement that the government "may not intentionally acquire any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States." But while Rogers was right that under Section 702, the government can't "wholly surveil domestic email traffic in the United States," his statement didn't tell the whole story, said several experts, including analysts for activist groups concerned about privacy. They say that in the process of gathering information about foreigners, the government might be sweeping up vast amounts of American email. As long it’s not gathered for the purpose of targeting a "particular, known person" in the United States, that would appear to be acceptable under the law. Meanwhile, American email might be read with authorization under different parts of FISA. "The government is expressly prohibited from intentionally targeting any person known at the time of the surveillance to be located in the United States," said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor who once worked for the Justice Department representing the United States on terrorism-related matters before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. "But that doesn't mean the government can never surveil people in the U.S.; it just means they can't do it under Section 702." Officials could instead get permission to read emails under other parts of FISA, which require showing that a person is an agent of a foreign power. Meanwhile, experts note that the government might be collecting vast amounts of Internet traffic that happens to include data from Americans. "It's illegal to target domestic email traffic, but nothing at all stops the government from intercepting emails between U.S. persons as long as it's an ‘incidental’ byproduct of surveillance that is specifically authorized under Section 702," said Steve Vladeck, an American University law professor. "So if the government targets an email server in British Columbia that happens to have a lot of Seattle-based email traffic, odds are pretty good they'll pick up a bunch of ‘domestic’ emails. Then the question becomes what they do with them." The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 that included Section 702 made that kind of incidental pickup of American email more likely, experts told us. Before that legislation, the government needed to seek a warrant to surveil a specific person. But under the law now, "they can target groups of people," said Trevor Timm, a digital rights analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "It's really unclear about the scope of how much Internet traffic they are sucking up," he said. "By targeting those foreigners, they are naturally vacuuming up Americans' emails." Our ruling Rogers suggested Americans are protected against NSA eyeballs on their email, claiming, "It's expressly prohibited by law that you can read and wholly surveil domestic e-mail traffic in the United States." He’s right that surveillance authorized under Section 702 of FISA prohibits targeting Americans or intentionally collecting domestic email. But it doesn’t explicitly protect against gathering up records as a byproduct of foreign surveillance. The government can also seek authorization for surveilling an American’s email if it can show that person is an agent of a foreign power. Rogers’ claim is accurate, but it needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Mike Rogers	None	None	None	2013-06-13T16:10:25	2013-06-09	['United_States']
pomt-02424	Says she made an "accurate prediction" that if Barack Obama were elected it would encourage Russia to invade Ukraine.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/04/sarah-palin/palin-i-predicted-obama-win-would-trigger-russian-/	Plenty of people criticized Sarah Palin as a foreign policy lightweight in 2008. But do the developments in Ukraine vindicate the former Republican vice presidential candidate? That’s at least what Palin suggested in a Facebook post to her audience of 4 million people. "I could see this one from Alaska. I'm usually not one to Told-Ya-So, but I did," she posted on her Facebook page Friday. Within a few days, more than 71,000 people had "liked" the post. Palin went on to describe her "accurate prediction," quoting herself from the 2008 campaign trail: "After the Russian Army invaded the nation of Georgia, Sen. Obama's reaction was one of indecision and moral equivalence, the kind of response that would only encourage Russia's (Vladimir) Putin to invade Ukraine next." Palin also took a victory lap Monday on Fox News. "Anyone who carries the commonsense gene would know that Putin doesn't change his stripes," Palin, the former governor of Alaska, told Fox News host Sean Hannity. "He hearkens back to the era of the czars, and he wants that Russian empire to grow again. He wants to exert huge power and dominance. So he has to get to those border areas and he has to capture them." A reader on reddit asked us to look into Palin’s prediction and to see if things played out as she said they would in 2008. We did not hear back from Palin, but we'll update this item if we do. Palin’s 2008 statement in context Palin’s comments about Ukraine came during an Oct. 21, 2008, speech in Reno, Nev. (You can watch them for yourself here.) Palin first mockingly thanked Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden, who days earlier said that Americans need to "gird your loins" for an international crisis if Obama was elected. "Watch, we’re gonna have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy," Biden said. Palin then turned to Obama’s foreign policy positions, criticizing Obama for: Saying he would negotiate with Iran without preconditions; Saying that he was ready to send American forces into Pakistan without that country’s approval; Wanting to withdraw American troops out of Iraq, "meaning our troops would have to go back to Iraq." At that point Palin turned to Ukraine, and uttered the quote she referenced in her Facebook post. "After the Russian Army invaded the nation of Georgia, Sen. Obama's reaction was one of indecision and moral equivalence, the kind of response that would only encourage Russia's Putin to invade Ukraine next." Palin said that day, "I want a president with the experience, judgment, wisdom and truthfulness to meet the next international crisis, or better yet, to avoid it." A prediction? And the connection between Georgia and Ukraine It is clear Palin suggested Russia might invade Ukraine. But did she predict it? And did it happen because of Obama’s reaction to Russia’s incursion into another former Soviet republic, Georgia, in 2008? Back then Obama wasn't president, George W. Bush was. "Palin did not predict anything; she laid out a possibility," said Mark Beissinger, director of the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies at Princeton University. "Her exact words are not exactly a prediction, but a comment that suggests it raised the probability that Putin would act against Ukraine in the future," said Mark Brawley, professor of international relations, McGill University. Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, a Washington academic center, had similar reservations. But he doesn’t quibble that she pointed to Ukraine as a geopolitical flash point. "She did raise the scenario," O’Hanlon said. "So I'd give her half credit." Trickier, our experts said, was Palin’s 2008 words linking Obama’s "indecision" about Georgia and forthcoming aggression in Ukraine. It’s a point where a definitive answer is not possible. When fighting broke out between Russia and Georgia, both Obama and his Republican opponent, Arizona Sen. John McCain, condemned the violence. Obama told reporters, "Russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of Georgia. There is no possible justification for these attacks." McCain was quicker to blame Russia than Obama. At first, Obama left room to criticize both sides in the conflict, largely because Georgia had been the first to attack, which then drew an overwhelming Russian response. However, Obama soon toughened his rhetoric against Russia. Setting aside Palin’s desire to characterize Obama’s words to the advantage of the McCain campaign, Beissinger told us that Palin could have just as easily aimed her words at Bush as at Obama. "Bush was president at the time of the August 2008 Russian invasion of South Ossetia and Abkhazia," Beissinger said. "The U.S. essentially did nothing at the time." If Putin was thinking of Georgia before he sent troops into Ukraine, it wasn’t necessarily due to anything Obama had said or done. The pattern of the American response in 2008 might have spoken louder than any policy pronouncement. The topic was debated Monday on Erin Burnett OutFront on CNN between liberal political pundit Peter Beinart and Mark Wallace, who served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Bush. Wallace was critical of Obama for some of his moves vis a vis Russia. But he said, "Certainly we're not responsible for Putin's intractable actions in Russia and invading Crimea." Beinart, a political science professor at City University of New York, said the relevant history goes back a lot further than Georgia. "When the Soviets went into Budapest in 1956, Dwight Eisenhower did not risk U.S. lives. When the Soviets went into Prague in 1968, Lyndon Johnson did not risk U.S. lives," Beinart said. "This is a tragic situation. We have to do whatever we can for Ukraine. But it has been a long-established fact that the United States is not going to risk significant U.S. casualties to fight a war with Russia near Russia's soil. And that fundamental reality, as much as we can try sanctions, as much as we can try diplomacy, is a fact before Barack Obama and after Barack Obama." Still, this has happened on Obama’s watch and there is the question of how to characterize his foreign policy. O’Hanlon sees two faces in the Obama record. "(It) included some elements of resolve, such as troop increases in Afghanistan and killing bin Laden, and some of restraint or passivity, as in Syria," O’Hanlon said. Finally, Palin’s statement has little to do with the particular events that led up to the Ukrainian crisis. Putin firmly backed his political ally, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, and faced a stinging defeat when protests and broad dissatisfaction led the Ukrainian parliament to unseat him. Keith Darden, a professor at the School of International Service at American University, said Palin turned out to be correct but for the wrong reasons. In Ukraine, Darden said, Russia’s vital interests are at risk. "It was not a lack of U.S. credibility that is implicated here, certainly not because of our actions on Georgia," Darden said. "Indeed, if the Georgian war had never happened, we would still see what happened this week." One last note, while Palin was eager to celebrate her Ukraine "prediction," the other items on her check list have not materialized as she warned. Among other things, Iran now is working within a 6-month pilot treaty to back off its nuclear program and when the U.S. did send troops into Pakistan, it was to kill Osama bin Laden, a move generally supported across the American political spectrum. Iraq remains violent and unstable, but American forces have not returned. Our ruling Palin said she predicted that Obama’s response to Russian military action in Georgia in 2008 would encourage Russia one day to invade Ukraine. The outside experts we reached did not find her words in 2008 to be a clear prediction, but they give her credit for accurately highlighting a place where a crisis in fact emerged. They did not agree with the logic behind her claim, however, and said there's a lot more to the story -- namely a history of America avoiding confrontation with Russia in its direct spheres of influence. Ultimately, whether Obama's actions somehow encouraged Putin and Russia to invade Ukraine is something Palin cannot prove. Her claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

pomt-11717	"Officials at Hyperloop One have referred to the route as one of the best they've ever seen."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/15/patrick-mckenna/missouri-has-competitive-hyperloop-route-maybe-not/	Imagine never having to make the monotonous drive on Interstate 70 again to get from St. Louis to Kansas City, or vice versa. Imagine taking less than 30 minutes out of your day to make the trip. If Hyperloop One builds a routein Missouri, that’d be a reality. Hyperloop is a transportation system that functions like a high-tech train, moving people in tubes from city to city at speeds similar to air travel. Patrick McKenna, director of the Missouri Department of Transportation, said Missouri is an appealing candidate for a Hyperloop route. "Officials at Hyperloop One have referred to the route as one of the best they’ve ever seen," he told the Kansas City Business Journal on Oct. 19. But did Hyperloop One officials say the St. Louis-Kansas City route is one of the best they’ve seen? What is Hyperloop? Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, published a white paper for Hyperloop in 2013, which was presented to former President Barack Obama later that year. According to its website, Hyperloop Technologies Inc. was established in Los Angeles in 2014. Earlier this year, the company successfully tested its propulsion system with the car in the tube, and the company projects three Hyperloop systems will be completed by 2021. Essentially, Hyperloop utilizes magnetic accelerators in a low-pressure tube system in order to propel rotors in individual capsules. The vehicles hover slightly off the track in the tube through magnetic levitation. This special environment allows a blazing top speed of 670 mph. Missouri efforts In May 2016, Hyperloop One opened its Global Challenge, urging cities and regions around the world to submit their pitches for a Hyperloop network. More than 2,600 proposals were sent to Hyperloop. Missouri submitted its application that fall, and was named as one of the 35 semifinalists in February 2017. We reached out to Hyperloop One officials, who didn’t respond, and to the Missouri Department of Transportation. Special assignment coordinator Robert Brendel directed us to links about the challenge. On Sept. 14, 2017, Hyperloop announced its winners via a press release. Even though it didn’t win, the Missouri route was designated as one of 11 finalists invited to continue developing the proposal. In response to being named a finalist, state officials established the Missouri Hyperloop Coalition in October to continue the conversation. The coalition includes MoDOT, the University of Missouri System, St. Louis Regional Chamber and the KC Tech Council. Dan Katz, Hyperloop’s director of global public policy, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the creation of the coalition helped the Missouri route’s future chances. "They were on the edge in that competition," Katz told the newspaper. Now, he said, "they are as competitive" as any on the initial list. The company had previously weighed in as part of Missouri’s aggressive pitch for attracting Amazon to either St. Louis or Kansas City for its second headquarters. Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd is featured in a short video about the potential for the transportation system in the state, which is available on the state’s Amazon HQ pitch website. The video is sponsored by the state’s Department of Economic Development, but the praise comes from Lloyd himself. Our ruling McKenna said Hyperloop officials called the proposed route between Kansas City and St. Louis "one of the best they’ve ever seen." The Hyperloop One CEO said the coalition proposed a great route. Its director of global public policy said the St. Louis-Kansas City route is "as competitive" as any on the initial list. But there’s no public record that any Hyperloop official ever called the route the best they’ve ever seen. Hyperloop selected 10 winners of its global challenge. Missouri was not on that list.

pomt-05662	"We also have, in a park that’s not far from here, an ability to build a reservoir that can hold a 30-day water supply for the city of Atlanta."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/19/kasim-reed/mayors-math-reservoir-not-wet/	Atlanta has plenty to offer. Water, a scarce resource in these parts, isn’t one of the selling points. But don’t fear, Mayor Kasim Reed says. Atlanta has a place that could potentially hold a substantial amount of water. "We also have, in a park that’s not far from here, an ability to build a reservoir that can hold a 30-day water supply for the city of Atlanta," Reed said during a recent radio interview with WABE-FM’s Denis O’Hayer. The mayor was referring to the Bellwood Quarry, a 138-acre property in northwest Atlanta, near Marietta Boulevard and Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway. Many people, particularly zombie fans, may recognize the quarry as a backdrop for the hit AMC series "The Walking Dead." Reed was on the radio to sell Atlanta residents on voting for a 1 percent sales tax to fund an ongoing multibillion-dollar effort to improve the city’s sewer system and produce cleaner drinking water. The mayor and O’Hayer talked big picture about the city’s and state’s water challenges, a discussion that prompted Reed to talk about the quarry. Plans for a reservoir are in the early stages, city official said. For years, Georgia leaders have battled with their counterparts in Alabama and Florida over control of the limited water resources in the region. The "water war," it’s been called. Maybe, we wondered, Atlantans won’t have any new wrinkles on their foreheads worrying about where their water will come from with the quarry’s development. Atlanta officials say that’s a stretch because a reservoir won’t solve all the city’s water needs. Besides, they said, the reservoir would cost about $180 million to build, and there is no projected start date. More importantly to our fact-checking operation, we wondered whether the mayor’s claim about the quarry’s potential water capacity is a stretch? Atlanta bought the quarry for about $35 million in 2006, when Shirley Franklin was mayor. Franklin and city leaders, eager to provide more parkland and green space in Atlanta, wanted to convert the century-old quarry site into a park with a lake. The lake wouldn’t be used for recreational purposes because of the loose rock around the rim and its depth. The entire surface area of the park is 138 acres. The surface area of the reservoir is 40 acres and between 250 and 400 feet deep, according to a fact sheet the city put together in June 2010. Here’s how the city says creating the reservoir would work: "The reservoir will be filled with water withdrawn from the Chattahoochee River at the existing water supply intake and pump station facility. It will be designed to operate as an off-line storage reservoir -- where water may be held for an extended period of time before being pumped into the Hemphill or Chattahoochee water treatment plants." Atlanta is considering plans to build a deep tunnel to carry water from the reservoir to the Hemphill treatment plant. "We think [the reservoir plans are] a good idea," Sally Bethea, executive director of the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, a nonprofit group that works to keep the region’s waterways safe from pollution. Businesses and residents who use the Atlanta system currently consume 90 million to 95 million gallons of water a day, said Janet Ward, the communications director for the Atlanta Watershed Management Department. The usage can rise up to 100 million gallons a day in the summer, she said. The quarry has the potential to hold approximately 2.4 billion gallons of untreated water, Ward said. PolitiFact Georgia divided the potential of water it can hold by 90 million gallons of water a day. The result came to nearly 27 days of capacity. Ward explained to us why the mayor said the quarry could hold a 30-day water supply. "I think [the 30-day estimate] started when we were in the depths of the drought and our daily usage was more like 85 million gallons a day," she said. "If the mayor said 30, that’s because that’s the figure we’ve been using all along. Since the drought, people’s usage has gone back up slightly." Reed’s statement is very close. The 27-day calculation prompts us to provide some clarification to his statement. Our rating: Mostly True.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2012-03-19T06:00:00	2012-02-23	['Atlanta']
pomt-06037	The education tax burden for Shelby County -- and Tennessee -- is "one of the lowest in the country."	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/13/kriner-cash/memphis-schools-superintendent-says-county-state-t/	At the Nov. 3, 2011, meeting of Shelby County’s schools merger Transition Planning Commission, Memphis City Schools Supt. Kriner Cash responded to a statement made by a suburban commissioner, Tommy Hart of Collierville, about Shelby County having "the highest tax rate in the state of Tennessee." Cash didn't quibble with that but claimed the rate is still "one of the lowest in the country." In some ways, Cash and Hart were talking past one another. Hart, a real-estate developer, used the more general term "tax rate" but clearly was referring to property taxes, which produce 60.1 percent of county revenues, with 30.6 percent of the county’s budget going to public schools budgets. Hart was asking Cash and the merger transition team to keep in mind that people are concerned about keeping local taxes from rising, even as the county moves toward funding a consolidated school system. The transition team is charged with creating a plan for merging Memphis City Schools with suburban Shelby County Schools in time for the 2013-14 school year. Cash took the opportunity to push back with a larger point he has emphasized in other settings -- the county and the state actually have an overall education tax burden that is very low compared to the rest of the country. Is Cash correct? To sort that out, we looked at tax burdens at the state and local levels, as well as education spending at the per-pupil level. Education Counts, the research and data center for Education Week, includes a table that shows the percentage of total taxable resources spent on education. By that measure, Tennessee tied for fourth-lowest in the country in 2008, the most recent year included in the database. In terms of per pupil spending, Tennessee ranks sixth-lowest, according to Education Counts. The state also rates low in a 2011 U.S. Census Bureau publication that examines school finances from 2009. It is the third-lowest state in the country for per-pupil spending ($8,141 compared to national average of $12,250) ahead of only Idaho and Utah, and, again, third-lowest in terms of education spending per $1,000 of personal income ($36.90 per $1,000 in Tennessee vs. national average of $47.74), ahead of only Florida and Washington, D.C. In terms of total state-local tax burdens, the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation shows Tennessee as fourth-lowest in the nation, with 7.6 percent of Tennesseans’ incomes going toward local and state taxes. So clearly, Tennessee’s tax burden and spending on education rank among the lowest in the country. But what about Shelby County’s in particular? It actually ranks in the middle of pack nationally. The Tax Foundation built a database with census data showing that, in terms of median property taxes paid on owner occupied housing, Shelby County ranks 345th of the 792 U.S. counties with a population of 65,000 or more. The median property tax of $1,902 is just behind Williamson County’s $1,914 and well above the next Tennessee county, Davidson, at $1,562. So while property taxes in Shelby County may be high for the state, they fall in the middle nationally -- below many counties in states where residents also pay state income taxes and/or local payroll taxes to help fund public education. However, it’s important to note that the majority of education funding for Tennessee school districts comes from the state, not the county. Our ruling So Cash is right about the state's ranking. The county is more in the middle of the pack nationally, but it accounts for a smaller share of education funding. We rate his claim Mostly True.

"Japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales, 16 dead," shouts a horror-show headline on a Feb. 11, 2017, post on ReligionMind.com. Facebook brought the post to our attention as potentially being fake as part of its efforts to eliminate false stories from its news feeds. The story — which again, didn’t happen — recounts the fate of the hapless crew of the whaler MV Nisshin Maru, many of whom abandoned ship after a gas leak forced them to clear the deck. The ship was supposedly stranded in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, off the coast of South Africa. In a twist of irony too dark to be true (because it isn’t), 16 whalers were swallowed by killer whales within a half hour of hitting the water. The yarn cast a wide net, landing on several websites, with one version of the article posted as late as Feb. 12. But we didn’t take the bait. The origin of this fish tale (yes, we know killer whales are mammals) goes all the way back to July 28, 2014. That’s when WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a website known for posting contrived stories, first published the saga of the Nisshin Maru. The story was pretty popular back then, too, because several media outlets wrote articles to point out it was a made-up story. Nearly all of them made reference to the site’s disclaimer, which reads, "All news articles contained within worldnewsdailyreport.com are fiction, and presumably fake news." There’s no indication on the various posts we found identifying the story is fake. There’s also no mention that it is several years old. We’ve noticed here at PolitiFact that some fake news stories seem to come back into the social media consciousness after a couple of years in limbo. We don’t know why this one returned to port after so long adrift, but the story is still anchored in fiction.

pomt-07204	"Manufacturing is having its best employment year in almost 15 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/06/austan-goolsbee/austan-goolsbee-says-manufacturing-jobs-growing-fa/	On the heels of a disappointing jobs report, Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Barack Obama, shined the best light he could on the administration’s economic record during the June 5, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour. Two days before his appearance, the government announced that the economy had created a net of only 54,000 jobs in May -- a number well below expectations, and also below the number of jobs created in the previous few months. Amanpour pressed Goolsbee on the issue: "What would you do to get this off the slow burner?" she asked. Goolsbee responded, "Well, I would say two or three things. The first is, the president has never stopped talking about jobs. For him, the growth strategy is the No. 1 issue. Now, we must live within our means. We have a moment that we can talk about long-run deficit reduction. And the vice president's leading an effort to do that, that the president has asked him to. But the president is getting up every day -- on Friday, he's going out to Ohio to talk about jobs in manufacturing, (and) manufacturing is having its best employment year in almost 15 years." We thought we’d check whether Goolsbee was right about manufacturing employment. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source for employment numbers. There are two ways to look at the issue. One is to look at manufacturing jobs for the first five months of the year over the past decade and a half. The other is to look at the full-year totals for manufacturing jobs, which means determining the total for 2011 by extrapolating a full year from the first five months’ data. First, we’ll look at the January-to-May figures. For 2011, the manufacturing sector has gained 76,000 jobs. To find gains that robust, you have to go back to 1994, when manufacturing gained 107,000 jobs from January to May. So by this standard, it’s 17 years, and Goolsbee actually understates his point. Now the full-year figures. For 2011, manufacturing jobs -- if they continue at their current pace -- would increase by 182,000. That’s the most for any year going back to 1997, when 288,000 jobs were created over the full year. And that was 14 years ago, which fits Goolsbee’s statement of "almost 15 years." At this point, we should note three bits of context. First, despite the gains for the year, manufacturing jobs fell by 5,000 during the previous month, as Amanpour pointed out in the interview. (Goolsbee countered that durable goods manufacturing jobs went up, and they did, by 8,000. Durable goods are those designed to last for multiple years, such as cars and dishwashers.) Second, despite the recent gains, over the past decade and a half, the manufacturing sector has shrunk -- consistently and inexorably. Since January 1994, the manufacturing sector has shed 5,160,000 jobs, leaving today’s number of manufacturing jobs 31 percent lower than it was at the start of 1994. And the actual shrinkage is even more stark than this statistic shows. Since January 1994, the labor force has grown by 18 percent. That means that simply maintaining its share of American employment would have required the manufacturing sector to increase by almost one-fifth since 1994, when in fact it declined by nearly one-third. The continual slide means that when you look at figures for the past decade and a half, most periods have shown a net loss of jobs. Since 1994, manufacturing jobs only showed a net increase six times for the January-to-May period, and only five times for the full-year period. In other words, it didn’t take much for the manufacturing job gains under Obama to stand out. On the other hand, it also means that the administration has some justification for citing the accomplishment. Third, manufacturing jobs have increased for two years running (and two January-to-May periods running) -- but the combined gains haven’t come close to canceling out the manufacturing jobs lost during Obama’s first year in office. In 2009, the economy lost more than 1.1 million manufacturing jobs. Counting the projection for 2011, the manufacturing sector will have rebounded by the end of this year by only 282,000 jobs, replacing only about a quarter of those lost since the start of 2009. While Obama isn’t solely to blame for this hemorrhaging -- the recession did start under his predecessor, George W. Bush -- this does make the overall assessment of the sector under Obama more downbeat than Goolsbee indicated on the show. On balance, we feel that Goolsbee’s decision to highlight manufacturing jobs may be aimed at downplaying the otherwise disappointing jobs numbers for May, but his facts are mostly on target, though he didn't provide the context of the large manufacturing job losses in 2009. Since assigning responsibility for the 2009 losses is a complicated business, we’ll lower Goolsbee just one notch and rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-00294	"Fourth grade reading and math scores, first in the nation. Eighth grade reading, first. High school AP classes and college education, both ranked first in the nation."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/sep/26/rick-scott/florida-aren-first-facts-about-rick-scotts-educati/	Gov. Rick Scott says in a new ad for his Senate campaign that he likes it when "Florida is first." "Fourth grade reading and math scores, first in the nation," Scott says in the ad. "Eighth grade reading, first. High school AP classes and college education, both ranked first in the nation. And now, our highest education funding ever. I like it when Florida is first." The only problem is that Florida isn’t first in most categories Scott talks about in the ad. The idea Florida has the "highest education funding ever" is also misleading. (We rated a similar version of that claim Half True.) Wrapping up his second gubernatorial term, Scott, a Republican, has his eye on a Florida Senate seat this November. He’s up against Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. Reading and math scores As evidence of Florida’s reading and math performance, Scott campaign spokeswoman Lauren Schenone sent us the 2017 National Assessment of Education Progress report and a governor’s office press release. We opened the links expecting to see a bunch of No.1 rankings for the Sunshine State. Instead, we found out that the 2017 NAEP data ranks Florida fifth in fourth grade reading, seventh in fourth grade math, and 25th in eighth grade reading. "Florida is not No. 1 among any subject or in any grade," said Stephaan Harris, a spokesman for the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policy for the NAEP. "If you look at the categories, there are states that perform significantly higher, meaning there’s statistical significance that illustrates those states scored higher and had better performance." The NAEP, a congressionally mandated project administered by the National Center for Education Statistics, is given to fourth, eighth and 12th graders in each state to evaluate their skills in several subject areas and compare them to the rest of the country. The Scott campaign did not respond to a request for clarification. Back in April, the governor’s office spun the results favorably, saying, "The results show that Florida is the only state to have improved significantly in grade 4 mathematics, grade 8 reading and grade 8 mathematics between 2015 and 2017." Other states improved in fourth and eighth grade reading, as well, but Florida is technically the only state that improved across those three metrics specifically from 2015 to 2017. However, as any student athlete MVP will tell you, "most improved" does not mean "first" or "best." The scores had a bit of room to climb. Florida’s eighth grade math scores aren’t leading the nation — 29 percent of students were at least proficient in 2017, compared to the national average of 33 percent. That was an improvement from 26 percent proficiency in 2015, which was significantly below the national average. Florida’s average eighth grade reading score improved slightly from 2015 but was not significantly different than the 2017 national average. Florida’s fourth grade reading scores were above the national average, not the best in the country. AP performance The ad additionally claims high school AP classes in Florida are ranked first in the nation. Scott didn’t say for what. An education department’s 2017 press release was more specific, pointing to participation in AP exams and improved scores. "Florida ranks first in participation in the AP exams during high school and third in the nation for improvement over the last decade," the release said. Compared to other states, Florida did have the highest percentage of 2017 graduates who took an AP exam during high school, according to the 2017 Florida AP Cohort data report. "Florida in 2017 had the highest ‘Percentage of Graduates Who Took an AP Exam During High School’ when comparing Florida among the 50 states, which was 54.6 percent," Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Audrey Walden said. However, when the numbers include 11th graders, Florida ranked fourth in AP exam participation per 1,000 11th and 12th graders in 2017, according to the College Board data about the number of students who took and passed at least one AP exam. Massachusetts, Maryland and Connecticut had more success. Florida has improved its AP exam participation in the past decade. As more people take AP exams, however, overall success wavers. Florida had a 51.6 percent pass rate in 2017, lower than 42 other states. College education There is one bright spot for Scott’s ad: When it comes to college education, Scott’s claim that Florida is No. 1 holds up, according to the metrics of the 2018 U.S. News and World Report survey. U.S. News put the state at the top of its 2018 "Best States for Higher Education" list, released in March. U.S. News used metrics including the share of people in the state with college degrees, as well as the time it takes to complete two- and four-year college programs, tuition costs and fees state-by-state and debt after graduation. Florida was No. 1 in the higher education category in 2017, as well. Our ruling Scott said, "Fourth grade reading and math scores, first in the nation. Eighth grade reading, first. High school AP classes and college education, both ranked first in the nation." But Florida is not first in any of the reading or math categories assessed by a national exam administered to public school fourth and eighth graders. And while Florida has a high number of students taking AP exams, they are not the highest-scoring or even the highest-participating state when looking at all AP students in 2017, not just graduates. Overall, Florida is ranked No. 1 in higher education, according to the 2018 U.S. News and World Report survey. Scott’s claim shows a sign of promise but leaves a lot of room for improvement. In classroom terms, that’s a D-minus. On the Truth-O-Meter, it adds up to a Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2018-09-26T16:18:34	2018-09-11	['None']

pomt-13458	"Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/14/hillary-clinton/clinton-ad-trump-management-was-charged-discrimina/	Black Americans have "everything" to lose if Donald Trump becomes president, says a recent ad out of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. "Trump management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law," the ad’s narrator says. The Clinton campaign has run the ad on cable television in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. There has been a lot of reporting on the subject of the Republican nominee’s discrimination lawsuits, so we decided it was about time we looked, too. We found that the government did, in fact, charge Trump and his real estate company with discrimination, in violation of the Civil Rights Act. Back in 1973, Trump was president of his father’s realty company, Trump Management, which operated nearly 40 apartment buildings comprised of about 14,000 residences total, mostly in New York City. In October of that year, the federal government filed a complaint against Trump, his father Fred Trump, and Trump Management. The complaint alleged that the Trumps violated the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, by discriminating against tenants and potential tenants based on their race. "The defendants, through the actions of their agents and employees, have discriminated against persons because of race in the operation of their apartment buildings," the complaint reads. Trump and the government eventually settled the claim, so Trump never admitted guilt, but documents prepared by the government describe numerous allegations of race-based discrimination at more than 15 different Trump Management properties. Many of the incidents involved a black person being told the complex had no availability when apartments were in fact available. For example, one black man asked about two-bedroom apartments at Trump’s Westminster complex in Brooklyn, and a superintendent told him nothing was available. That was March 18, 1972. On March 19, 1972, the black man’s wife, who was white, visited the complex and was offered an application for a two-bedroom apartment on the spot. The government lawyers also interviewed several people who said executives for Trump Management discouraged rental agents from renting to black people. In one case, the government claimed the Trump Management comptroller instructed one rental agent to attach a sheet of paper that said "C" for "colored" to every application submitted by a person of color. Another rental agent said Fred Trump told him to encourage black tenants to find other housing in order to decrease the black population at that particular complex. Donald Trump called the charges "absolutely ridiculous," according to the New York Times article that originally reported the charges back in 1973. Trump and his company filed a countersuit the following December, claiming the government made baseless charges and asking for $100 million in damages. The court dismissed the countersuit. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment, but they have continued to deny the charges in recent comments to other news outlets. Trump and the government settled the case in 1975. Trump Management agreed to train employees about their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and to launch a two-year marketing program to inform the community about their fair housing practices, including giving a weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, among other requirements. Trump saw the settlement as a success, writing in his 1987 memoir, Art of the Deal: "In the end, the government couldn’t prove its case, and we ended up taking a minor settlement without admitting any guilt. Instead, we agreed to do some equal-opportunity advertising of vacancies in the local newspaper. And that was the end of the suit." Experts told us that settlements don’t mean the parties involved are innocent, though. The government settles "north of 98 percent" of these kinds of housing discrimination cases, and often fairly quickly, said Robert Schwemm, law professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert in housing discrimination law. And in every settlement, the agreement allows the defendant to say they’re agreeing to take voluntary action to remedy the problem without admitting guilt. "That doesn’t mean there wasn’t lots of evidence" against Trump, Schwemm said. The government brought their suit against Trump five years after the Civil Rights Act went into effect. There was plenty of race-based housing discrimination nationwide at that time, Schwemm said. But the government had limited resources dedicated to this issue, so government attorneys prioritized bringing complaints against big "pattern" cases that they believed would have a broader impact. Schwemm said of the 20 to 30 Fair Housing Act cases the government brought against fair housing providers in the first five years, he’s only aware of two in New York, including Trump’s, and very few others in cities outside the southern United States. A lot of the housing discrimination at that time was subtle — like taking a black person’s rental application and just never looking at it. The more blatant sort of discrimination alleged in Trump’s case, that they coded applications based on race, was "not unheard of" but "pretty extreme," Schwemm said. In 1978, the government wrote a letter to Trump’s lawyers saying they believed the company had violated the settlement by steering black tenants to specific properties, according to the New York Times. But the government ultimately didn’t pursue the case before the settlement terms expired. Our ruling Clinton said, "Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law." The government in 1973 accused Trump, his father and Trump Management of violating the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The case alleged Trump’s realty company discriminated against non-white tenants and potential tenants at numerous apartment complexes. The government settled the lawsuit, after Trump waged a years-long legal battle, so Trump never admitted guilt. But the company did agree to comply with extensive requirements intended to stop housing discrimination at its properties. Clinton’s claim is carefully phrased. For that, we rate her claim True.

pomt-10000	On the propriety of budget reconciliation.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/30/judd-gregg/judd-gregg-against-reconcilation-now-has-been-it-p/	When Democratic leaders said they wouldn't rule out a procedure called budget reconciliation to pass sweeping measures on health care reform and carbon emissions policy, Republican senators immediately objected. Little known outside Washington, budget reconciliation is a policy created in 1974 that essentially allows the Senate to pass legislation on revenue and spending levels with a simple majority — 51 votes rather than the 60 needed to beat a filibuster — and without amendments or the possibility of a filibuster by the minority party. The majority party sometimes attaches nonbudget legislation to a reconcilation measure to move it more expeditiously. For a fuller explanation, see the official definition here . Bottom line, when your party's in power, you probably like it. And when it's not, you probably don't. "It is interesting to see the views on reconciliation and how they've changed since, say, the Bush tax cuts in 2001," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on March 23. Sen. Judd Gregg, who was briefly under consideration to serve in Obama's Cabinet as commerce secretary, has been the loudest Republican voice opposing the possibility of reconciliation. And he's also been singled out as an example of how Republicans have been hypocritical on the issue. In remarks on the Senate floor on March 17 criticizing President Barack Obama's proposed budget, Gregg spent nearly half of his time railing against the possibility of reconciliation. "You're talking about the exact opposite of bipartisan," Gregg said. "You're talking about running over the minority, putting them in cement, and throwing them in the Chicago River. Basically, it takes the minority completely out of the process of having a right to have any discussion, say, or even the right to amend something so fundamental as a piece of legislation of this significance. ... So using reconciliation in this manner on this type of an issue would do fundamental harm, fundamental harm, to the institution of the Senate. I mean, why have a Senate if you're going to do reconciliation on something this significant? You might as well go to a unicameral body. Be like Canada. Have one body and have it be the House of Representatives because that will be the practical effect of using reconciliation here." Contrast that, as the New York Times did , with Gregg's position in 2005, when Democrats complained about the use of budget reconciliation to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Gregg called their objections "inappropriate" and said, "We are using rules of the Senate here. Is there something wrong with majority rules? I don't think so." So is that a simple flip-flop? Maybe not completely. First, it's important to recognize that in his statements about reconciliation over the past two weeks, Gregg has been upfront about his support of the policy in the past. But he has consistently said that what's different this time is that it is being talked about as a way to slam through major initiatives — health care reform and the cap-and-trade plan to limit industries' carbon emissions, which is likely to result in higher energy costs to consumers. "Sometimes over the years (reconciliation) has been used in an aggressive way," Gregg said. "It was used to adjust already existing programs, authorized programs, entitlement programs, and tax proposals. President Bush used it aggressively on taxes. In 1997, President Clinton used it aggressively along with a Republican Congress on everything — entitlement and taxes. But it was always directed at existing policy and adjusting that policy. In other words, raising the tax rate or dropping the tax rate, changing an entitlement program in some way that already existed or not changing an entitlement program. "Reconciliation has never been used for the purposes of putting in place a dramatic new federal program which will fundamentally shift the way the government functions in this country," Gregg said. "It has never been used in the sense as an initiating event. The carbon tax or the national sales tax on electric bills is a massive exercise in industrial policy, totally redirecting how energy is produced in this nation and affecting everybody in this nation. ... Obviously rewriting the health care system of this country is a dramatic exercise affecting absolutely everyone in this nation at all sorts of different levels, a brand-new major program. These are initiatives of significant size and import." Our review of the instances when reconciliation has been used indicates Gregg is correct and that it's been used for less dramatic policy changes. And so Gregg doesn't get a Full Flop. But we find his arguments — made repeatedly in several press conferences and political news programs — that the tactic "totally undermines the purposes of the two branches of government" a bit hypocritical in light of his prior statements in support of reconciliation. And so we rate it a Half Flip.	None	Judd Gregg	None	None	None	2009-03-30T14:53:55	2009-03-17	['None']

pomt-10008	Under Obama's budget plan, families making over $250,000 are "going to lose their mortgage deduction, their charitable deductions."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/24/cynthia-lummis/cynthia-lummis-claims-families-who-make-over-25000/	At the weekly Republican leadership news conference on March 24, members took turns taking shots at President Barack Obama's proposed budget. One of them, Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., took up the cause of a Kansas tumbleweed farmer to drive home her point. "Every small business in this country will be affected by the president’s budget," Lummis said. "I think of a couple in Kansas. The woman in the family sells tumbleweeds for a living to augment their family farming salary. But they better not make more than $250,000 a year or they’re going to lose their mortgage deduction, their charitable deductions, their taxes are going to go up. So there is a cap now on the American dream. Especially the American entrepreneurial dream for small businesses." We wondered if selling tumbleweeds was a path to the American Dream, but a quick check on the Web set us straight about the public appetite for the dried brush. Apparently, there are enough TV producers in need of props and home decorators with an affinity for the American West for some people to make good money selling tumbleweeds. But we digress. The issue here is whether the family of our tumbleweed farmer, or any other family that makes more than $250,000, would lose their mortgage and/or charitable deductions under Obama's plan. That would be a shocking change because the mortgage deduction enjoys sacred protection in American tax law, and the charitable contribution deduction isn't far behind. To check out her claim, we went right to the Obama administration's proposed budget. In a section that talks about offsetting the cost of lowering health care expenses and expanding health insurance coverage, there is a proposal to reduce itemized deduction rates for families with incomes over $250,000. The plan is to "limit the tax rate at which high-income taxpayer can take itemized deductions to 28 percent." So for families in higher tax brackets, say 36 or 39 percent, they'd only be able to write off 28 cents on the dollar (as opposed to 36 or 39 cents), said Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center. Say you are in a tax bracket where you pay a 36 percent rate; if you had $1,000 a year in mortgage interest payments, you'd currently be able to deduct $360. Under Obama's plan, you'd only be able to deduct $280. "You won't lose the deduction," Toder said. "It would be pared back. But it'd be inaccurate to say you'd lose it." Same thing with charitable deductions. They wouldn't be lost, as Lummis suggests, they would simply be scaled back. And judging by the less-than-enthusiastic reaction this proposal has received in Congress, Toder doubts it will be enacted anyway. (Now, Lummis is right that families making over $250,000 would see an overall tax hike under Obama's plan. That was a hallmark of Obama's campaign. Essentially, Obama would allow the Bush tax cuts for those earners to expire next year. That would raise the tax rates for some from 33 to 36 percent; for others from 35 to 39.6 percent.) We'll allow for a bit of hyperbole in Lummis' statement that raising tax rates for families making over $250,000 amounts to putting a cap on the American Dream. What we find egregious is her claim that these high earners would "lose" their mortgage and charitable deductions. She's alleging that Obama wants to eliminate a sacred cow, a cherished deduction for decades. But that is just patently false, alarmist, and a complete distortion of the administration's budget proposal. We rate her statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-13761	"Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-largely-right-household-incomes-are-d/	Donald Trump assailed the health of the United States economy in his acceptance speech Thursday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. "What about our economy?" he asked, rattling off a series of statistics. "Two million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That’s 16 years ago." Here, we’ll focus on the final part of that statement -- that household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. On the numbers, Trump is right. Once you adjust for inflation, median household income fell from $57,724 in 2000 to $53,657 in 2014, the last full year for which data is available. That’s a decline of $4,067 -- in line with what Trump said. This chart shows the trend since 2000. However, it’s worth noting one bit of context. While this statistic came amid a series of shots at President Barack Obama, the majority of the period Trump was referring to came under the presidency of George W. Bush, a Republican. During the first eight years of the span Trump referred to -- 2000 to 2008 -- Bush was president. And during Bush’s tenure, inflation-adjusted median household income declined by $2,411, which is more than half the total amount it fell between 2000 and 2014. Since Obama took office, it has fallen by $1,656. That’s not a great legacy, but it’s worth remembering that slicing the numbers this way puts all of the Great Recession on Obama’s watch while also denying Obama 2015, when there was a slow but steady recovery, because data is not available. Our ruling Trump said, "Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000." He’s right on the number. However, for a statistic embedded in a series of attacks on Obama, it exaggerates the income trend under the current president. A majority of the decline in real household income since 2000 actually occurred under a Republican president. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd9bd01f-4542-406b-b87e-313c218b1da3	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-21T23:47:53	2016-07-21	['None']
pomt-10602	"When the Fair Tax becomes law, it will be like waving a magic wand releasing us from pain and unfairness."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/23/mike-huckabee/magic-wands-dont-exist/	Mike Huckabee makes the Fair Tax sound lovely. But he's glossing over objections raised by a host of critics who say that the Fair Tax is unfeasible and unworkable. The Fair Tax would be a sales tax that would replace all income taxes. Legislation to create it, which Huckabee supports, is introduced annually in Congress; the latest version can be found here . It's true that if the Fair Tax were implemented, people would get all of their paychecks (unless their employers decided to cut wages and keep the tax savings for themselves). Getting all your taxes back certainly sounds like a nice release from pain. But there are other potentially painful implications down the road that Huckabee sidesteps. Proponents of the Fair Tax support a 23 percent tax rate that assumes most people would pay the taxes they owe. Economists say that when sales taxes reach that level, the incentive for people to cheat rises. People will try to buy things off the books, and underground economies will develop. To compensate for tax evasion, the tax would have to be raised even higher, which would lead to more evasion. Abolishing the Internal Revenue Service would exacerbate the problem of compliance, said economist Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C. "At the end of this story, when you add in some state sales taxes, we could be close to 50 percent." he said. "Almost all the economists who have looked at proposals for relying exclusively on a sales tax have concluded that it is unworkable because the tax rate would have to be very high." That sounds kind of ouchy to us. The transition process could also cause economic disruptions as people across the country stock up on goods before the sales tax takes effect. "The economy would experience a surge in demand for goods as the switchover date approached and then demand would collapse," wrote David Cay Johnston in his book on tax evasion and enforcement, Perfectly Legal . A change-over would also negatively impact people who've saved, especially senior citizens. Retirees, who already have paid taxes on their income, will be taxed again on purchases they make from savings they already paid taxes on. (For a longer discussion of the Fair Tax, read our article on it here .) Much of the Fair Tax debate depends on what will happen if the country switches from an income-based system to a consumption-based system, a major overhaul of U.S. tax policy that could have significant unintended consequences. To be clear, we're not ruling on what will happen if the Fair Tax is implemented. Rather, we're pointing out that Huckabee's statement blithely glosses over a number of highly credible objections. It's tempting to give him a pass on his statement as just more overheated campaign rhetoric. But it seems clear to us that such a massive overhaul of the U.S. tax system would not be an end to pain and unfairness "like a magic wand." So we find his statement False.

pomt-10549	"Hillary interned with Bob Treuhaft, the head of the California Communist Party."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/15/chain-email/shes-no-red/	In the heyday of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, associating with a known communist was grounds for intense suspicion and scrutiny. That was the early 1950s. A line in a widely circulated chain e-mail, from an article written by former Clinton adviser-turned-foe Dick Morris, seems like old times. "Hillary interned with Bob Treuhaft, the head of the California Communist Party," Morris wrote. "She met Bob when he represented the (Black) Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him." It sounds outlandish, but there's a little something to it. While at Yale Law School, Hillary Clinton did spend the summer of 1971 interning as a law clerk at the firm Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. "A small law firm in Oakland, California," Clinton succinctly refers to it in her autobiography. By all accounts it was a fairly radical left-wing law firm, known for taking on discrimination and social injustice cases. But senior partner Treuhaft was not "head of the California Communist Party" as Morris claimed in his article. It is true that Treuhaft was once an active member of the American Communist Party. Investigated and harassed by McCarthyites in 1950s, Treuhaft was listed by the House Un-American Activities Committee as one of the most dangerously subversive lawyers in the country, according to his 2001 obituary in the Times of London. But he became disillusioned with the party and left it in 1958, before Clinton started her internship with the firm. In her book, Clinton makes only passing reference to her responsibilities at the firm, stating, "I spent most of my time working for Mal Burnstein researching, writing legal motions and briefs for a child custody case." Burnstein, who was never a communist, is retired now. Reached at his home in California, Burnstein recalled that Clinton was one of the firm's better summer interns: smart and a hard worker. "She wasn't political at all, that I remember," Burnstein said. "The only politics that were discernible were probably liberal politics. ... She came to us because of the civil rights cases we did, the things we did with racial equity and other civil rights things. That was her interest." It irks Burnstein that some want to attack Clinton for her association with the firm, even though he doesn't support her run for president. "I think she did something that was relatively noble and altruistic when she was a young woman," Burnstein said. Burnstein couldn't recall what specific cases Clinton worked on, but at the time, he said, he had cases where landlords refused to rent to black people, and one in which a group of doctors took umbrage with being asked to sign a "loyalty oath" attesting that they were not communists. But they also did a lot of landlord-tenant, workers' comp, family law and personal injury cases. "We did poor people's law," Burnstein said. So why hasn't Clinton talked much about it? "I think you can figure out why," Burnstein said. In addition to Treuhaft's former association with the Communist Party, another partner in the firm, Doris Walker, was, and still is, an active member. "It was who they were," Burnstein said. "It didn't really have a lot to do with the way we practiced law." Clinton must have known about those associations, he said. "It's not like it was a secret." Clinton's campaign did not respond to Times inquiries. Walker, now retired, said she figured someone would try to make political hay out of it eventually. Reached at home in California, she said she "must be the only living Communist Party member of my generation." "It was sort of a left-wing firm," Walker said, but most of the lawyers were not communists. To dredge it up now, she said, amounts to little more than red-baiting. In his biography of Clinton, former Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein states that at Treuhaft's firm, "she would be working for one of the most important radical law practices on the West Coast, celebrated for its defense of constitutional rights, civil liberties and leftist causes." Bernstein quotes Treuhaft as saying, "The reason she came to us, the only reason I could think of because none of us knew her, was because we were a so-called Movement law firm at the time." It doesn't say so in Morris' article, but in his 2004 book, Rewriting History, — an acerbic rebuttal to Hillary Clinton's autobiography, Living History — Morris notes that, for the record, he doesn't think Clinton is a Communist and that he doesn't mean to imply that because she worked at the law firm she was. No, no, of course not. "But the fact that she chose this job out of all the summer jobs that might have been available, traveling 3,000 miles for it, tells something about her orientation at the time," Morris wrote. "Just as the fact that she does not describe the firm's work or reputation says something about her today." There's not only no evidence Clinton was a communist sympathizer, Morris doesn't have his facts right (at least not in the version in the FrontPageMag.com article that made its way into a chain e-mail). Treuhaft was not head of the California Communist Party, nor was he a member when Clinton worked for his law firm. But she did intern for Treuhaft's firm. And he was, at one time, a member of the American Communist Party. So we rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-02-15T00:00:00	2008-01-24	['None']

pomt-15321	"Thanks to the Obama administration’s negotiations, Iran’s nuclear program will be under lock, key and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/16/don-beyer/deal-puts-irans-nuclear-program-under-lock-key-and/	Now that the Obama administration has negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran, it’s time for Congress to see whether opponents can muster enough votes to scuttle the deal. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., came out early with an op-ed supporting the agreement. Published on July 14, 2015 -- just as the agreement was being announced in the United States -- Beyer’s column had a straightforward title: "Why I’ll vote in favor of the Iran nuclear deal." "Thanks to the Obama administration’s negotiations," Beyer wrote, "Iran’s nuclear program will be under lock, key and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The eyes of the international community are on every centrifuge, every ounce of uranium, in all of Iran’s nuclear facilities. Inspectors have ‘when needed, where needed’ inspection rights to any Iranian military site suspected of being involved in the nuclear program." We wondered whether it’s accurate for Beyer to say that "Iran’s nuclear program will be under lock, key and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year." So we checked the text of the agreement and asked a range of experts. We found that -- as might be expected for a lengthy agreement that has barely been available for scrutiny and that hasn’t yet been tested in practice -- there’s quite a bit of room for disagreement in interpretation. Beyer’s strongest argument concerns certain specific Iranian assets that will be under 24/7 monitoring by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA. According to the agreement, "for 15 years, Iran will permit the IAEA to implement continuous monitoring, including through containment and surveillance measures, as necessary, to verify that stored centrifuges and infrastructure remain in storage, and are only used to replace failed or damaged centrifuges." This round-the-clock monitoring will explicitly include "electronic seals which communicate their status within nuclear sites to IAEA inspectors, as well as other IAEA approved and certified modern technologies," according to the agreement. For instance, at an Iranian facility like Natanz, where more than 5,000 centrifuges will be operating, the IAEA will have cameras that provide 24-hour monitoring, said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School. In addition, the agreement says, "Iran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily access as requested by the IAEA, to relevant buildings at (the Iranian nuclear facility at) Natanz ... for 15 years." However, this sort of 24/7 surveillance will not be the rule everywhere in the Iranian nuclear archipelago. "At most locations, inspections will be every once in a while, on a schedule the inspectors judge to be sufficient based on the sensitivity of the activities at that location, how long it would take for Iran to do something there that would make a difference, and so on," Bunn said. For this reason,"I would not say it’s accurate that the entire program is under ‘lock, key, and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,’ " Bunn said. The other sites have "the potential to be inspected at any time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, but in reality there won’t be inspectors or cameras physically there all the time." In fact, even if Iran ultimately agrees to a contentious inspection, the wait could be as long as 24 days. The agreement spells out that if the IAEA and Iran can’t work out their differences over suspicions about undeclared nuclear materials or activities within 14 days, a joint commission empowered by the agreement would try to resolve the situation for another seven days. Once the commission decides what to do, Iran would have three more days to follow through. There is wide agreement that the inspection protocols are the most stringent devised for any country not defeated in war. But there is less agreement on whether that standard is sufficient to stop a country intent on getting nuclear weapons from getting them. Rick Brennan, a senior political scientist at the Rand Corp., a think tank, calls the protocol a "far cry" from the ironclad promises Beyer makes. "There are a number of provisions in the monitoring regime that enable Iran to delay, obstruct, and eventually prevent IAEA inspectors from effectively monitoring any portion of the Iranian nuclear program that it seeks to hide," Brennan said. Five of the eight members of the joint commission would have to agree to both the concerns of the IAEA and the protocols involving that specific inspection, he said, calling it "an extremely high hurdle because China and Russia will almost certainly side with Iran on most issues." Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, agreed. "The real problem is this: When inspectors get delayed, denied, hassled, bugged, followed, or pelted by stones from ‘spontaneous’ mobs, what do you do? We should recall that Clinton bombed Iraq in Operation Desert Fox in 1998. Will Obama do that? I very much doubt it," he said. However, other experts say that for many key sites, a 24-day wait is still sufficient, given the complexity of the nuclear process and the time required to construct and ramp up the needed infrastructure. At an Iranian facility known as Arak, for instance, a reactor "is years away from being able to operate -- it would be pointless to have inspectors there 24/7," Bunn said. Bunn also cited the experience of the secret 2007 bombing of a nuclear site in Syria. "The Syrians bulldozed the entire site and cleaned it up and blocked IAEA access until months later, but the IAEA still found uranium particles that couldn’t be easily explained," a discovery that led to the IAEA’s conclusion that it had been a nuclear site, Bunn said. This is the argument Obama is making. "As for the fact that it may take 24 days to finally get access to the site, the nature of nuclear programs and facilities is such, this is not something you hide in a closet," he said at a July 15 press conference. "This is not something you put on a dolly and kind of wheel off somewhere. And, by the way, if we identify an undeclared site that we’re suspicious about, we’re going to be keeping eyes on it. So we’re going to be monitoring what the activity is, and that’s going to be something that will be evidence if we think that some funny business was going on there that we can then present to the international community." Ultimately, the plan’s supporters and its critics both make fair points, said Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University. "It is true that there will be a process for granting access to some sites, and it is also true that this will take time and that critics think it is too much time," Nephew said. Our ruling Beyer said, "Thanks to the Obama administration’s negotiations, Iran’s nuclear program will be under lock, key and camera 24 hours a day, 365 days a year." Parts of Iran’s nuclear complex will indeed be under high-tech surveillance and monitoring around the clock. But for other parts of the country’s nuclear infrastructure, there will be no such direct surveillance, and inspectors won’t have the right to barge in whenever they want -- they could be delayed for as long as 24 days. While some experts say such delays won’t undercut the agreement’s effectiveness, others disagree. Beyer’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-11495	"It’s now constitutional to ban [assault weapons] in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity."	true	/illinois/statements/2018/feb/27/nancy-rotering/after-parkland-can-illinois-communities-ban-assaul/	As mayor of north suburban Highland Park, Nancy Rotering has been in the thick of the debate over gun control in recent years. Since 2013, her suburb has prohibited weapons like the semiautomatic rifle used to kill 17 Parkland, Florida, high school students and teachers on Valentine’s Day. The Illinois city’s gun ban has survived a court challenge, with the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 refusing to hear an appeal of a ruling that upheld the Highland Park law. The practical effect of that decision was to signal other local governments that they could legally impose bans on certain types of military-style guns without violating the Second Amendment. But Rotering, one of eight Democrats vying in the March 20 primary for their party’s nomination for Attorney General, said there’s still a catch in state law that prevents other Illinois towns from following Highland Park’s example. Just days before the Parkland shooting, Rotering told the Sun-Times this: "We in Highland Park banned assault weapons and were taken to the United States Supreme Court and we prevailed. It’s now constitutional to ban these weapons of war in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity." Nothing is ever simple when it comes to inevitably bitter disputes over gun restrictions versus gun rights, and that clearly is the case with the fate of assault weapons bans in Illinois. If the Supreme Court says Rotering’s Highland Park can impose a ban, why then does she say that other communities are prevented from doing the same? We decided to take a look. Gun law confusion In 2013, Illinois became the last state to allow the concealed carry of guns when the legislature approved it under pressure from a federal appellate court ruling. A few years prior to that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a blanket handgun ban imposed by Chicago. When it comes to even more lethal firepower, the gun debate can get especially perplexing, with those for or against gun controls often sounding as if they speak different languages. While the term "assault weapon" is commonly used to describe firearms used in mass shootings, advocacy organizations like the Illinois State Rifle Association (an affiliate of the National Rifle Association) refuses to refer to semi-automatic rifles that fire a single round each time a trigger is pulled as assault weapons. Nonetheless, ordinances like that in Highland Park that ban semi-automatics often refer to them as assault weapons. Similarly, the package of Illinois laws that allowed concealed carry also included a clause designed to block imposition of piecemeal weapons bans from town to town. "The regulation of the possession or ownership of assault weapons are exclusive powers and functions of this State," the statute reads. It was that language that stripped local governments of their authority to pass their restricting semi-automatic rifles, ammunition magazines and related weapons and devices. "Local control of certain things are bad," said Richard Pearson, executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association. "If they want to tax someone to death, I don’t care. They can build roads, but the Second Amendment is a fundamental right." Two lawmakers instrumental in passing the concealed carry legislation, Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, and Rep. Lou Lang, D-Skokie, said the local restriction language was the price gun-rights advocates insisted on to reach a compromise. "There was a constant battle between the pro-gun and gun-safety advocates," Lang said in an interview. The measures included a narrow loophole, however. They went into effect July 9, 2013, but gave local governments a 10-day window past that date to pass local assault weapons bans. Highland Park, Chicago, Evanston and Skokie were among the few local governments that took advantage of the opening. Cook County updated an existing ban, effectively extending it to all other suburbs in the county. Two years later, state Sen. Julie Morrison, D-Deerfield, introduced legislation to reinstate power to local governments to pass assault weapons, but it languished in committee and eventually died. Morrison said she is considering another try in the wake of the Florida shooting. Meanwhile, the Illinois House is expected this week to consider several different bills aimed at gun control, including a proposed state licensing system for gun dealers. Our ruling Rotering says: "It’s now constitutional to ban these weapons of war in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity." While there’s much disagreement about how to respond to the problem of gun violence, Illinois’ law on banning powerful rifles, commonly referenced as assault weapons, is clear. Only the state of Illinois — and not local governments — can pass an assault weapons ban, although local governments like Rotering’s Highland Park were granted a narrow and long-since expired window to approve their own bans. Those provisions were included by lawmakers in a 2013 law that allowed the concealed carry of weapons in Illinois. In claiming that the "Illinois General Assembly has failed" to reopen the door to local weapons bans, Rotering resorts to language that to some lawmakers seems over the top because she appears to be equating inaction with failure. But the essence of her claim is correct. Lawmakers inclined to back Morrison’s proposal acknowledge it has lacked the votes to pass up to now. Even so, the Legislature has had the opportunity to revisit the issue and did not do so. From that perspective, Rotering is accurate, which is why we rate her statement True.

pomt-10922	"Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/30/donald-trump/has-donald-trump-had-highest-poll-numbers-any-gop-/	President Donald Trump is known for tooting his own horn. In recent weeks, one of the accomplishments he’s been trumpeting is his standing with Republican voters. In a July 29 tweet, Trump wrote, "Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. There must be something wrong, please recheck that poll!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It wasn’t the first time he’d said something similar. On July 10, he said in a tweet, "New Poll says Trump, at over 90%, is the most popular Republican in history of the Party." And three days later, in an interview with the British newspaper The Sun, Trump said, "You know, a poll just came out that I am the most popular person in the history of the Republican Party. Beating Lincoln. I beat our Honest Abe." Trump has reason to crow about his popularity among Republicans: His approval rating within his own party has ranged from 84 percent to 90 percent since mid April 2018. The ratings for approval among Republicans "are moving in a narrow range," said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. "They are very high and pretty stable." And the media has taken note. Around Trump’s 500th day in office on June 4, there were a flurry of articles that noted how Trump’s approval ratings at that point in their tenure were higher than those of most previous Republican presidents, at least among respondents in their own party. For instance, the Daily Mail cited Gallup — the longest-running source for presidential approval ratings – to report that Republicans’ support for Trump, then at 87 percent, was higher on his 500th day than any post-war president except for George W. Bush, who was at 96 percent with Republicans after the 9/11 attacks. (For that matter, no Democrat had a higher rating with Democrats than Trump did with Republicans.) But the way Trump phrased his tweet was problematic. One concern involves polling at the time of Honest Abe — to be precise, the lack thereof. The other involves higher approval ratings of recent Republican presidents. There were no scientific opinion polls in Lincoln’s day Unscientific straw polls date to at least 1824, with "informal trial heat tallies" "taken in scattered taverns, militia offices, and public meetings," D. Sunshine Hillygus, a Duke University political scientist, has written. But the polls of Lincoln’s time are not considered scientific. The idea of scientific polling came into its own after a disastrous 1936 poll by Literary Digest, a popular magazine. The magazine’s poll was based on responses from millions of Americans, but the data it gathered had a significantly different demographic balance than the electorate as a whole. This lack of scientific rigor led the poll to incorrectly call the 1936 presidential election, opening the door to survey methods championed by George Gallup and others. Gallup began polling in 1935 using a method that's different from today's but rigorous for its time. Early polls by Gallup determined the demographic makeup of the electorate, then assigned survey-takers to visit far-flung locales in order to personally interview respondents with certain demographic characteristics. Today, reputable pollsters use a better system: random sampling to choose phone numbers from across the country, which they then call to ask standardized, carefully worded questions. The assumption is that a truly random sample will reproduce the whole nation in microcosm to within a few percentage points of accuracy (the familiar "margin of error"). Modern polling has its critics, and the industry has had to adapt its methods to account for factors such as the growing use of cell phones. One newer type of poll is based on online "panels" of voters designed to mirror the demographics of the electorate. Despite its imperfections, scientific polling remains the best tool available. And Lincoln never faced it. Trump’s standing among Republicans is high, but not highest all-time Now let’s look at the only Republican presidents for whom scientific polling data exists. The most recent publicly available data from Gallup’s weekly tracking poll at the time of Trump’s tweet showed him with 85 percent approval from Republicans. So how does that 85 percent rating compare with his Republican predecessors? We looked at Gallup historical data for Republican presidents going back to Eisenhower. We looked for the closest polling data for July 29 of their second year in office (the day of Trump’s claim). We used the equivalent period after the inauguration of Gerald Ford, who unlike the others was not sworn in on Jan. 20. President Approval rating among Republicans, near July 29 of second year Donald Trump 85 percent George W. Bush 96 percent George H.W. Bush* 79 percent or 91 percent Ronald Reagan 74 percent Gerald Ford 67 percent Richard Nixon 81 percent Dwight Eisenhower 92 percent *For the elder Bush, Gallup polling around the relevant date was less frequent; we’re showing the closest results on either side of that date, one of which is higher than Trump and the other of which is lower. So, as of the point of Trump’s tweet, not only did George W. Bush have a higher approval rating among Republicans, but so did Dwight Eisenhower and, arguably, George H.W. Bush. Two other points of comparison make Trump’s achievement less impressive. One is to compare Trump’s highest approval rating of his tenure so far — 90 percent as recently as mid-July — to the record-high rating for his predecessors through July 29 of their second year in office. President Highest approval rating among Republicans through July 29 of second year Donald Trump 90 percent George W. Bush 99 percent George H.W. Bush 94 percent Ronald Reagan 92 percent Gerald Ford 77 percent Richard Nixon 90 percent Dwight Eisenhower 92 percent By this measure, Trump actually ties for the second-worst of any post-World War II Republican president, surpassing only Ford. Another approach is to compare each president on the highest approval rating of their tenure. (Trump has only been in office for a year and a half, but he opened the door to this analysis by claiming the "highest poll numbers in the history of the Republican Party.") President Highest approval rating among Republicans, entire time in office Donald Trump 90 percent George W. Bush 99 percent George H.W. Bush 97 percent Ronald Reagan 94 percent Gerald Ford 80 percent Richard Nixon 91 percent Dwight Eisenhower 95 percent Once again, by this measure, Trump fares the second worst of any post-war Republican president, only surpassing Ford. By historical standards, Trump has had "solid, but not extraordinary in-party approval," said Kathleen Joyce Weldon, director of data operations and communications at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University. Worth noting: The differences in some cases are small and would be within the margin of error. While Trump remains popular among Republicans, it’s worth noting that his approval rating among Americans as a whole is quite a bit lower. (Trump’s 40 percent approval rating, per Gallup, was exceeded by all of his predecessors at that point in their presidencies.) In the meantime, a smaller proportion of Americans are identifying themselves as Republicans, said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. According to Gallup, the share of Americans who call themselves Republicans was 31 percent from Feb. 1-5, 2017, the first measure after Trump was inaugurated. But between March and July 2018, that number has ranged between 23 percent and 27 percent. While the shift is small, Smith said, it may be a sign that some critics of Trump within the Republican Party are simply leaving the party for now, rather than registering a negative assessment to pollsters as a Republican. Our ruling Trump said, "Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan." Credit where credit is due: Trump is very popular among Republicans, and at one point, his approval rating within his own party trailed only George W. Bush among postwar Republican presidents. However, no pre-1936 president served in an era with scientific polling, so Trump’s comparison of himself to Lincoln is spurious. Meanwhile, Trump’s approval rating at the time of the tweet ranked in the middle of the post-World War II Republican presidents, and measured in other ways, his support among Republicans was actually worse than every post-war Republican president except for Gerald Ford.

pomt-13391	"I did not support the war in Iraq … The record shows that I’m right."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-claims-again-he-was-against-war-iraq/	Donald Trump says it’s "mainstream media nonsense" when reporters push back on his repeated claims that he opposed the Iraq War prior to the 2003 invasion. At the Sept. 26 presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y., moderator Lester Holt posed to Trump that he "had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion." "I did not support the war in Iraq," he said, interrupting Holt. "The record shows that I’m right." The challenge with Trump’s claim is that we can’t go back in time and get inside his head, so we’ll never know what his private thoughts were. However, one thing is clear: The record does not prove him right. Trump has trouble getting past a September 2002 interview with shock jock Howard Stern. Stern asked Trump if he supported the looming invasion. Trump responded, "Yeah, I guess so." At the debate, Trump said he made these comments to Stern "very lightly." Trump then noted another interview he did in January 2003, a few months before the invasion. Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. "Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know," Trump said. "He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned." So Trump put the economy ahead of confronting Iraq, but he didn’t speak against going to war. At most he suggested waiting for the United Nations to do something. A week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave different takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that "the war’s a mess," according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, "The market’s going to go up like a rocket." Throughout 2003, Trump complained about the cost of the Iraq War and its effect on the economy. The earliest evidence of Trump’s outright opposition to the war didn’t come until an August 2004 article in Esquire, more than a year after the war started: "Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way," Trump said. Trump has been challenged many times in this election to explain his early acceptance of the war. In a February 2016 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Trump said that he didn’t know what he meant during his 2002 conversation with Stern. "That was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head." Trump said. At the Sept. 26 debate, Trump also said he had many debates with Fox host and Trump supporter Sean Hannity prior to the Iraq invasion — in which Trump opposed the invasion, and Hannity supported it. However, they didn’t have these debates on the air so we have no record of them. Hannity has said this is "100 percent true." Our ruling Trump said, "I did not support the war in Iraq … The record shows that I’m right." The record does not support Trump’s repeated assertions that he opposed the war prior to the 2003 invasion. Around the time of the invasion, Trump’s comments were few and far between, not to mention vague. In 2002, asked if America should go to war, he said, "I guess so." Less than three months before the invasion, Trump said the president should be more focused on the economy, but he didn’t specifically speak against launching an attack. He didn’t voice full-throated opposition until almost a year and a half after the invasion.

pomt-11489	"Zero percent of kids in Cairo are college-ready."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/feb/28/chris-kennedy/chris-kennedy-flunks-data-interpretation-101-cairo/	Democratic governor candidate Chris Kennedy declared recently that not a single high school senior was prepared for college in historic but economically distressed Cairo at the southern tip of Illinois. Kennedy, speaking last month to the editorial board of the Carbondale-based Southern Illinoisan, was trying to make a broader point about the sorry state of Illinois school financing when he highlighted troubling details about school kids in Cairo. ‘‘Zero percent of kids in Cairo are college-ready," Kennedy told the newspaper. That caused a stir in Cairo, a mostly African-American community of 2,600 at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, and prompted Kennedy to later issue a statement to the paper expanding on his initial remarks with new data. The numbers he cited the second time were different and parsed. "It is the fault of Springfield that only 6 percent of Cairo Junior/Senior High School students (have) met college readiness levels," Kennedy said. "In fact, 0 percent are college ready when it comes to math." Wondering what gives with Kennedy’s multiple choice approach to evaluating Cairo schools? So were we. Making the grade Long ago, Cairo was a thriving river port. The town figured in a key plot twist of Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn as the point where Huck and his friend Jim, a slave, planned to stop their southward drifting raft trip on the Mississippi so Jim could catch a boat north into the free states. Their raft, however, bypassed the port in a fog. As the economic heart of Illinois shifted toward Chicago, the state’s so-called Little Egypt region was hard hit, few places more so than Cairo. One consequence is that residents of the bottom end of the state have come to develop an innate wariness of politicians from the north coming to court votes without spending much time trying to understand the region or its needs. Enter Chris Kennedy and his sweeping statement about the education shortcomings of high school seniors that left many in Cairo scratching their heads and wondering how the candidate could make such a claim without ever setting foot in the school. That’s because 18 of the 24 members of Cairo’s 2018 high school graduating class have received at least one college offer, according to Andrea Evers, the superintendent of the Cairo junior and senior high school where, because of declining enrollment, grades 6-12 are taught under one roof. Ten of those students have also gotten a head start by taking college classes through a dual enrollment program at a nearby community college. But Kennedy wasn’t referring to any of that in making his point about the ramifications of limited state funding. When we reached out to his campaign, a spokeswoman confirmed he made his claim about zero college readiness based solely on a reading of state standardized test data. That said, he made two different statements citing two contradictory sets of figures. What explains the difference? His initial comment referenced an overview of Cairo students’ ACT scores that showed none of those who took the test last year scored high enough to be considered college-ready in all four core subjects. That compares with 28 percent readiness in all four subjects among students statewide. The state once required all high school juniors to take the ACT college admissions test, and the results were then used to benchmark student proficiency. But Illinois dropped the mandatory ACT rule in 2015, eventually replacing it with a requirement that juniors take the competing SAT college admissions test. So when Kennedy chose to highlight ACT test results for students in Cairo’s class of 2018, he was pointing to an incomplete set of data. It did not reflect the scores of the entire class, but only those students who chose to take the ACT. What’s more, a caveat about the incompleteness of the data is posted clearly on the website of the Illinois State Board of Education where Kennedy or his staff found the numbers. It reads in part: "This percentage relates to the students in the class who chose to take the ACT test before graduation and is not representative of the entire class, district or state." Kennedy’s second statement to the Southern Illinoisan that mentioned a 6 percent proficiency number referred to SAT results also posted on the state board website. But whichever data set Kennedy was referring to, Evers said he still missed the mark. "He was looking at a data set and interpreting it without ever having a conversation with anyone locally," said Evers, who has been with the district for six years and can rattle off a long list of political leaders who have made the trek to Cairo, including Democratic U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth. The state school board, which compiled the testing data Kennedy drew from, likewise cautioned against using test data in a vacuum to determine how prepared students are for college. "I wouldn’t say that the SAT is the only indicator of college and career readiness because it’s one test and so it can only tell you so much," ISBE spokeswoman Jackie Matthews said. "We’re building out a much more robust college and career readiness indicator that looks at a lot more experiences that students have in high school that are very important and aren’t necessarily captured by the SAT." A draft of that plan was presented to the board in January. It considers factors like volunteer and work experience along with taking classes for college credit, as some of Cairo’s seniors are doing. Our ruling Kennedy tried to make a point about inadequate state school funding when he declared "zero percent of kids in Cairo are college-ready." But school officials in that deep southern Illinois community report a majority of current seniors have already received acceptance offers from at least one college. Kennedy backtracked on his original statement when news media sought clarification, though he did not admit error. In the second go-around, he pointed to slightly better numbers from a different set of state-collected test data. The first figure Kennedy referenced relied on the ACT, a test the state no longer uses for its proficiency benchmark. Some, but not all, Cairo students took that test, meaning the results were incomplete and did not reflect the performance of the entire class of 2018. The caveat is clearly stated on the schools website accessed by the Kennedy campaign to derive data about Cairo. Kennedy later revised his comments to cite a different set of college preparedness data based on a different test that the state now administers to high schoolers. The results from that second set of tests, the SAT, are not great when it comes to Cairo, but they also don’t show zero percent college preparedness. It also should be stressed that the Illinois State Board of Education cautions against using a standardized test score as the sole indicator of college preparedness. The confusing set of numbers and assertions reeled out by Kennedy to bolster his comments about Cairo students make it clear he didn’t do his homework before claiming initially that no members of the graduating class of 2018 were prepared for college. For that reason, we rate his statement False.	None	Chris Kennedy	None	None	None	2018-02-28T19:00:00	2018-02-09	['Cairo']
pomt-09100	"When I become the nominee, the Democratic nominee, I will be the only pro-choice candidate on the ballot."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/22/kendrick-meek/meeks-pro-choice-stance-stands-out/	There was a time when Kendrick Meek didn't need to defend his Democratic credentials. The son of a popular Democratic congresswoman and a longtime party loyalist, Meek has run unopposed in every general election since his foray into national politics in 2002. When the Miami congressman aimed his ambition toward Florida's U.S. Senate seat, the forecast was an easy primary win. Then along came Jeff Greene, a real estate investor and Palm Beach billionaire whose TV ad blitz helped carry him into a two-way tie with Meek only weeks after he entered the race in April. Now Meek's hopes seem pinned to exposing Greene's former Republican flirtation while broadcasting his own Democratic lineage. In a June 22, 2010, Palm Beach Post debate, Meek painted himself as the principal defender of public education, the middle class and legal abortions. "When I become the nominee, the Democratic nominee, I will be the only pro-choice candidate on the ballot," he said. If Meek makes it to the general election, would he be the only Roe v. Wade defender in the race? We decided to check it out. Florida has 22 candidates for U.S. Senate. Of those, seven are write-in candidates who won't appear on the ballot. In the Democratic primary, the 4-person field is expected to come down to Meek and Greene, who also supports Roe v. Wade. "I believe that abortion should be safe, legal and rare," reads his campaign website. But Meek's statement envisions a November scenario where he is the Democratic candidate. So, while Greene’s stance provides useful context, it isn’t relevant to our ruling. Of the three Republican candidates, former House Speaker Marco Rubio is expected to secure his party’s nomination. Rubio is fiercely anti-abortion. He boasts on his campaign website: "As a state legislator, I supported various pieces of pro-life legislation that, among other things, would require doctors to perform ultrasounds before performing abortions and another bill that would ban the use of taxpayer dollars to fund stem cell research." There are also six candidates running as independents and two third-party candidates: Lewis Jerome Armstrong, a contractor from Jacksonville, said he was pro-life, but would support abortion in situations involving incest or rape. Sue Askeland, a housewife from Stuart, said she was against all abortions. Bobbie Bean, a farmer and printer from Sebring, said he would only support abortions in situations involving incest, rape or life-threatening pregnancies. Bernie DeCastro, the Constitution Party of Florida candidate from Ocala, supports a federal law that would define life as beginning at conception, said spokesman Donald Barber. Bruce Ray Riggs of Crystal River didn’t return our call. Libertarian Alexander Snitker, an office supplies salesman from Spring Hill, identified himself as pro-life. He said abortion should be a state issue, but added he wouldn't vote to undermine Roe v. Wade. "Government shouldn't decide for someone else," he said. Then there is Gov. Charlie Crist, easily the best known independent candidate. His abortion views are a tad complicated. Crist, who left the Republican party in April 2010 to secure his position on the general election ballot as an independent, has maintained a flexible abortion stance during his political career. He called himself "pro-choice" in 1998, then recast himself as an anti-abortion candidate in his gubernatorial bid. In his latest political rebirth, Crist insisted he was still personally pro-life, but would not legislate according to his views. In June 2010, he rejected a controversial abortion bill that would have required most women seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound and listen to a doctor describe the fetus unless they signed a form to opt out. The bill was described as the most significant anti-abortion measure in Florida history by proponents. Campaign spokesman Nick Autiello said Tuesday that Crist is personally pro-life, but accepts that abortion is legal. That's not a rousing pro-choice endorsement. Meek’s campaign insisted that Crist’s gelatin-like abortion record does not amount to a substantial pro-choice stance. "On Charlie Crist, it is almost impossible to PolitiFact him because he doesn’t hold a position," said Adam Sharon, Meek’s spokesman. To highlight Meek's credentials, his campaign pointed to an early endorsement from the NARAL (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League) Pro-Choice’s political action committee. "He brings a distinguished record of support for a woman's right to choose to this race. Without question, voters in Florida will have a clear choice, regardless of which anti-choice candidate Meek faces in the general election," said the organization's president, Nancy Keenan, in a press release. However, Keenan also sent out a press release praising Crist after he vetoed the abortion bill. The press release called the veto, "a victory for Florida women," and gave credit to both Crist and Meek for triumphing over the Republican-led effort. Let’s review. If Meek were to trump Greene in the primary, he would undoubtedly be the most passionate pro-choice candidate on the general election ballot. That seems to be the point he wanted to make. But, that's not what he said. He said he would be the only pro-choice candidate, and that statement needs some clarification. While Crist may not harbor the sharpest pro-choice views, he still has taken a seat in that tent both in recent days and in the past. Given Meek's solid pro-abortion stance and Crist's rotating views, we rule Meek’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00088	"We invite SNL viewers to Vermont to see all that we have to offer, including our increasingly diverse communities... The leaves are changing and so is Vermont."	half-true	/vermont/statements/2018/oct/31/michael-schirling/vermonts-leaves-are-changing-racial-makeup-its-pop/	A Saturday Night Live skit on September 29 spoofed Vermont’s reputation as a "Caucasian paradise" with a fake meeting held by white supremacists. In response, Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary Michael Schirling sent SNL some Vermont flannel shirts Oct. 2 and responded to the show’s creators that Vermont is becoming more racially diverse. "We invite SNL viewers to Vermont to see all that we have to offer, including our increasingly diverse communities and wide array of tourist destinations including the African American Heritage Trail," said Schirling in the statement, which the department sent to Boston.com. "Now is a perfect time to visit or to consider a move here. The leaves are changing and so is Vermont," he said. We decided to see if Schirling's statement was true, given that Vermont remains the second whitest state in the union. Is the state becoming more racially diverse? It turns out there has been a slight uptick in Vermont's non-white population. Schirling said he obtained his information from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, a research project that produces population, demographic and housing estimates, indeed has found that Vermont is becoming more racially diverse, or at least less white. The survey found that Vermont was 95 percent white in 2013 and 94.2 percent white in 2017, a drop of 0.8 percent, according to a spokesperson for the American Community Survey. Within the category of non-white races in the Census data, there are many variations. From 2013 to 2017, the increase in the African-American population from 1.1 percent to 1.3 percent, was not statistically significant. But the percent change in the Asian and Hispanic populations was: Asians went from 1.2 percent of the Vermont population to 1.8 percent, a 0.6 percentage point increase; Hispanics went from 1.5 percent to 1.9 percent, a 0.4 percentage point increase. Our ruling The statement that Vermont is becoming increasingly diverse needs further clarification. Schirling does not explain that the increase in Vermont's racially diverse populations is slight. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Michael Schirling	None	None	None	2018-10-31T15:40:16	2018-10-02	['None']
pomt-11799	"FBI Uniform Crime Report for 2016 shows more than four times as many people were stabbed to death than were killed with rifles of any kind."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/nov/18/nick-schroer/out-context-comments-inflate-stabbing-statistics/	Mass shootings are on the rise. This year has seen the Las Vegas massacre and two church shootings occur and spur lots of discussion in media, legislature and households. The topic of gun laws continues to be a partisan issue. Rep. Nick Schroer, R-O’Fallon, said that more people were killed by stabbings than by rifles in 2016. "FBI Uniform Crime Report for 2016 shows more than four times as many people were stabbed to death than were killed with rifles of any kind," Schroer wrote on Twitter on Oct. 17. The tweet featured a Breitbart article with the information and a link to FBI crime data. We weren’t sure about stabbings killing more people than rifles, so we decided to check the numbers for ourselves. Schroer’s office pointed us to the same data as the Breitbart article, so we started there. The thing about rifles First, it appears that the Breitbart article is talking about national numbers, so we assume Schroer is doing the same. Schroer uses the term "rifles." The data provided by the FBI breaks down murders by types of firearms, and rifles is a subsection of all firearm murders. When totaling the data from the FBI crime report, we see that 374 people were killed by rifles, while 1,604 were killed by knives or cutting instruments. That means about 4.3 times as many people were killed by knives or cutting instruments as were killed by rifles. "He is comparing a full set of cutting instruments to a partial set of guns which makes cutting instruments look more deadly," said Dr. James Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University. Nolan used to work for the FBI as a unit chief in the Crime Analysis, Research and Development Unit. "The real story from the data is that the odds of being murdered by a firearm are nearly seven times higher than the odds of being murdered by a knife or cutting instrument," he said. When you look at firearms murders overall, the number is staggeringly different: 11,004 murders out of 15,070 total murders were committed with firearms. That is, 73 percent of U.S. murders were committed with firearms — 3.4 percent of firearm murders were committed with a rifle. The other categories are shotguns, handguns and "type unknown." Other caveats The FBI acknowledges the data are not comprehensive: Not all homicide data is submitted to the FBI. The page holding the data has a disclaimer that says, "The data are based on the aggregated data from agencies within each state for which supplemental homicide data (i.e., weapon information) were reported to the FBI." It also points out that Florida’s data didn’t meet regulations and is not included, and Illinois and Alabama submitted limited data. That means a few large cities, like Chicago, may not be perfectly represented in this data. Also, murders in the "type unknown" category could include rifles but were not identified as such when submitted to the FBI. That could change the comparison of rifles to stabbings. Our ruling Schroer said that more than four times as many people were stabbed to death than were shot and killed by rifles in 2016. Schroer is cherry-picking data by comparing all people who were stabbed to death versus a small percentage of those that were shot to death. In 2016, 73 percent of U.S. murders were committed with firearms, but while 10.6 percent were committed with some type of knife or cutting instrument, just 2.5 percent were committed using rifles. Because the statement is correct according to the data but key context to the entirety of firearm usage is missing, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08454	Says Chris Dudley thinks Oregon’s minimum wage is too high.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/15/john-kitzhaber/john-kitzhaber-claims-chris-dudley-finds-oregons-m/	What Chris Dudley thinks of Oregon’s minimum wage -- is it too low, too high, or just right? -- has been one of the more contested issues in Oregon’s heated race for governor. John Kitzhaber, the Democrat, has released a television ad claiming that Dudley thinks waitresses make too much and that the minimum wage is a problem for Oregon’s struggling economy. The Democratic Party of Oregon followed up with a press release saying that Dudley was caught on camera agreeing with a person who thinks the wage is too high. In Kitzhaber’s jaunty 30-second spot, the announcer describes Dudley as a wealth strategist who wants to give huge tax breaks to the rich. Then, it cuts to a clip of Dudley at a Sept. 9 , 201o, event at Intel in Hillsboro. The text of his words appear on screen: "Restaurants will say ... it doesn’t make sense that our waitresses are getting tips ... plus the highest minimum wage in the country." However, the audio does not have him saying the part about "restaurants will say." The commercial then cuts again to Dudley saying, at the same event, "... having the highest minimum wage in the country negatively impacts the state." Both camps have been urging PolitiFact Oregon to rule on the question of what Dudley said about the minimum wage. So we will. Some background: Oregon has the second highest minimum wage in the country, after Washington state. And the hourly rate is set to increase another 10 cents, to $8.50 an hour, on Jan. 1. Oregon is one of 10 states where the wage is adjusted every year, pegged to inflation. (Last year, the minimum was not increased because inflation was flat.) The ballot measure ensuring such increases was approved by voters in 2002. The restaurant association and the farm bureau, which support Dudley, have long complained bitterly about Oregon’s minimum wage. The restaurant lobby in Oregon and elsewhere has pushed for short-term training wages to pay first-time workers. Dudley said later at the Intel exchange that he would like to look into a training wage program to get young workers job experience without burdening employers. Democrats say that’s further evidence that Dudley wants to lower Oregon’s minimum wage. Dudley’s camp says that’s not necessarily true since they could set up a system where the state makes up the difference between the minimum wage and a training wage. Let’s start with a fuller transcript of the exchange Dudley had with the questioner. (And by the way, the Democratic Party of Oregon released the video and has been shopping it around to showcase Dudley’s uber-rich leanings.) Questioner: "My question comes back to labor and labor costs. I’ve noticed that our state tends to have a very high minimum wage and I think that’s difficult for our businesses but I think it, it also attracts people from other states to come to our state and take our jobs away from our kids and, and those that might need them. I think it attracts the wrong end of the labor pool to our state, and they tend to stay here and ... I’m concerned about that, I’m interested to know what your - if you share that philosophy and if you have any idea what you would do about that or if you want to address that issue."    Dudley at first says, " I agree with you on that issue." He then goes on to say, "having the highest minimum wage in the country negatively impacts the state," and "you talk to restaurants, restaurants will say, listen, we’ve got less employees than we would otherwise because of this and it doesn’t make sense ..." He goes on to mention restaurant kitchen workers who don’t get tips and says "there’s so many negative issues with it that I think need to be addressed." It’s fair to say his 72-second response was unscripted and a bit rambling. But it is clear that he agreed with the questioner that Oregon’s high minimum wage causes problems for the business community. Dudley spokesman Jake Suski said his boss "was agreeing that there is some economic theory supporting the question." As for the part about whether wait staff earn too much, Suski says Dudley was "explaining what restaurants have told him, not offering his own opinion." Suski said Dudley does not want to lower Oregon’s minimum wage and he does not think servers earn too much. Dudley’s comments at Intel have dogged him on the campaign trail. The issue came up in a Sept. 28 meeting with The Oregonian’s Editorial Board, where he said he wanted to look at the minimum wage in light of high unemployment among young people. In the only debate between the two candidates on Sept. 30, Kitzhaber indicated that Dudley was more concerned about waitresses and their tips than sound fiscal policy. Dudley responded forcefully: "I’ve never said I wanted to reduce the minimum wage and I’m not. End of story. Not reducing the minimum wage. End of story." Dudley’s current, clearer message leaves the distinct impression that, at least when it comes to what he said about waitresses and tips, he probably wishes he could eat his words. But is Kitzhaber right? Does Dudley, in his heart of hearts, think Oregon’s minimum wage is too high, too low or just right? PolitiFact Oregon put the question to the Dudley camp. It took a couple of tries, but we might have an answer. "That's not the issue, he has clearly said he won't lower it and that the voters have decided on this issue," Suski said in an initial e-mail. Then he wrote in a second e-mail: "He doesn't believe that the minimum wage is too high and he's clearly not in favor of lowering it..." So if he thinks the minimum wage is not too high, why not say that to the person who asked the question? Suski responded: "He just acknowledged the economic theory around it and said he's not making an issue of it. What he wants to address is youth unemployment and getting young people opportunities in the workforce, which is why he's been talking about a credit for employers to hire young workers." If we had a Duck-O-Meter, PolitiFact Oregon would rate this a Full Duck. Dudley said he "agrees" with the questioner on the issue, but now his campaign says he was merely acknowledging a theory. But if Dudley is ducking, Kitzhaber is stretching. Oregon Democrats and Kitzhaber go too far in claiming that Dudley thinks waitresses make too much money and that he wants to lower the minimum wage. Nevertheless, any reasonable person watching the original exchange would believe that Dudley agrees the minimum wage is too high or, at the least, problematic -- despite what his camp says now.

pomt-00645	"It is simply a fact that insufficient funding for Amtrak has delayed the installation" of a positive train control safety system. "To deny a connection between the (derailment in Philadelphia) and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/18/charles-schumer/after-derailment-chuck-schumer-says-shortage-funds/	After an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Philadelphia on May 12, 2015, a safety official said a technological fix could have prevented the deadly accident. Talking to reporters the day after the crash, which killed eight and injured many more, Robert Sumwalt, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said positive train control, or PTC, would have prevented the loss of life on Northeast Regional train 188, which entered a curve at more than 100 miles per hour, or twice the posted speed. "We feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred," Sumwalt said. Sumwalt’s claim quickly became a bone of contention between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. At a House Appropriations Committee meeting the day after the crash, the Republican majority cast votes to cut grants to Amtrak for capital spending by about 15 percent. Democrats and Republicans squabbled over both the substance and the timing of the move. At a news conference, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, rejected criticism by Democrats that linked congressional funding cuts to the crash. "Listen, you know they started this yesterday -- ‘It’s all about funding, It’s all about funding.’ Well, obviously, it’s not about funding," Boehner said. "The train was going twice the speed limit. Adequate funds were there. No money's been cut from rail safety, and the House passed a bill earlier this spring to reauthorize Amtrak and authorize a lot of these programs." To that, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded, "Speaker Boehner’s comments are patently false. Experts have made clear that positive train control could have prevented the tragedy in Philadelphia. It is simply a fact that insufficient funding for Amtrak has delayed the installation of PTC, and to deny a connection between the accident and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality." A reader asked us to check whether Schumer was correct. What we found is that money is indeed one obstacle, but not the only one. Positive train control and its pricetag A positive train control system uses signals and sensors along the track to communicate train location, speed restrictions, and moving authority, according to the Congressional Research Service. If the train is going too fast, equipment onboard automatically acts to slow or stop it. In 2008, a Metrolink train crash in Chatsworth, Calif., killed 25 people and injured more than 100; investigators blamed the engineer for texting while driving. In response, Congress voted to require most of the national rail system -- about 60,000 miles -- to be updated with positive train control by December 2015. Amtrak was making progress on that goal and had installed positive train control on portions of the Northeast Corridor, but it had not yet done so on the stretch of track in Philadelphia where the accident occurred. Amtrak CEO Joseph Boardman told the New York Times that the system was close to being operational throughout the Northeast Corridor by the end of this year. Schumer has a point that cost has been an obstacle in meeting Congress’ requirements, both for private freight-rail companies and for Amtrak, which is dependent on federal funding. The Federal Railroad Administration has estimated that implementation of positive train control will cost roughly $14 billion. To put that in context, capital investment by U.S. railroads in 2010 amounted to $11 billion, about two-thirds for structures and one-third for equipment. So the estimated cost of meeting the mandate is "roughly equal to the railroads’ total capital spending in a single year," according to the Congressional Research Service. When Congress enacted the requirement for positive train control, it did not designate funds to carry it out. Private freight rail carriers have dipped into their corporate pockets to install the new system -- and they acknowledge that they are behind schedule -- but Amtrak had little choice but to go to Congress to secure funding. "Projects of this magnitude take many years for any public agency to work into their capital budgets," said Karl Witbeck, a principal in the transportation practice of the consulting firm Stantec. There’s "no doubt the lack of capital funding has paid a large role in the delay of finishing the implementation of PTC for Amtrak." The rest of the picture However, Schumer’s statement glossed over other factors that have hampered the implementation of positive train control. Here are a few of those suggested to us by experts. • Amtrak’s failure to seek, prioritize and use the money it did have. A report by the Amtrak inspector general released on Dec. 20, 2012, cited several obstacles in implementing Congress’ positive train control mandate. One was Amtrak’s failure to come up with "complete and reliable cost estimates and budgeting" for the system. The report called the budgeting process "fragmented," noting that two different Amtrak departments are responsible for estimating the costs of positive train control, depending on whether the installation is on property owned by Amtrak or another entity. The report also says Amtrak never asked for enough funds to finish the project in either its five-year financial plan or its fiscal year 2013 budget request to Congress. A Transportation Department official was quoted in the report stating that the department purposely omitted installation costs from these documents because they "would weaken Amtrak’s negotiating position with the host railroads because it would alert the railroads to the amount of money that was potentially available to pay these costs." (Amtrak did not provide answers to questions submitted to PolitiFact by publication time.) • The system is technologically challenging. Even if funding posed no obstacle, overlaying a positive train control system over decades-old rail lines is a complex task. Positive train control "is not off-the-shelf technology and has had to be developed from scratch," said Ed Greenberg, a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads, whose members include most major rail carriers, including Amtrak. In order to work properly, positive train control needs a certain amount of radio frequency available for the various pieces of the system to communicate with one another. The inspector general’s report cited this as the "most serious challenge" to implementing positive train control. The Federal Communications Commission -- which oversees the frequency spectrum -- told the New York Times that regulatory delays in approving antenna installation are now "largely gone." Still, the accumulation of past delays, whether attributable to the FCC or to Amtrak, have pushed back the implementation of positive train control, experts say. Part of the problem for Amtrak has been a need to purchase the rights to radio frequencies on the open market, from existing companies that use that spectrum. "When spectrum is in short supply, as is the case in many urban areas, the railroads have to go to the secondary market and purchase it at a premium," said Joseph C. Szabo, a former administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration. Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, emphasized that the senator was not implying that the delay was solely the result of insufficient funds, but rather that it was a contributing, and perhaps even primary, driver of that delay. In addition, he said, the challenges of purchasing spectrum rights are intricately linked to Amtrak’s budgetary shortcomings. "Had there been sufficient funding, the installation and broadband acquisition processes would have begun earlier and could have moved faster, and thus ended earlier," House said. Our ruling Schumer said that "it is simply a fact that insufficient funding for Amtrak has delayed the installation" of a positive train control safety system. "To deny a connection between the (derailment in Philadelphia) and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality." Schumer has a point that insufficient funding has been an obstacle to implementing positive train control in locations like the one where the accident occurred. But other factors played a role as well, including administrative problems within Amtrak and technical challenges such as difficulty obtaining radio frequencies. The statement is partially accurate but oversimplifies by leaving out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-10042	The stimulus has "$30 million in there to protect mice in San Francisco."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/13/mike-pence/no-money-stimulus-san-francisco-mice/	To hear Republican House members tell it, you'd think House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stuffed $30 million into the stimulus bill to benefit an endangered mouse in her district. Rep. Steve King of Iowa called it an earmark and "a pet project" while pointing to a sign he made that said "Pelosi's Mouse slated for $30 Million." Rep. John Boehner of Ohio opposed the bill and asked how money "for some salt marsh mouse in San Francisco is going to help a struggling autoworker in Ohio?" And Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana said on Fox News that there was "$30 million in there to protect mice in San Francisco." The tale of the mouse appears to have originated around Feb. 6, 2009, from Republican staff members of the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee. "Appropriations Republicans, concerned with this irresponsible process and possible abuse of taxpayer funds, have asked various federal agencies how they intend to spend the windfall of cash that Congress may approve in the 'stimulus' bill," said a memo posted to the site. "One peek behind the bureaucratic curtain has yielded the following examples of hidden program information that is not included in the language of the bill or report . These are programs which various federal agencies have privately indicated they will fund with 'stimulus' money." The memo lists a number of projects, including up to $37.5 million for "wetland restoration in the San Francisco Bay Area — including work to protect the Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse." That became fodder for a Feb. 11 e-mail from Michael Steel, Boehner's spokesman. "Thirty million dollars for wetland restoration in the San Francisco Bay Area — including work to protect the Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse," Steel wrote. "This sounds like spending projects that have been supported by a certain powerful Democrat in the past. And it certainly doesn't sound like it will create or save American jobs." That e-mail made it into a Feb. 12 story in the Washington Times headlined "Pelosi's mouse slated for $30M slice of cheese." The story stated, incorrectly as it turns out, that the stimulus bill "includes $30 million for wetlands restoration that the Obama administration intends to spend in the San Francisco Bay Area to protect, among other things, the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse." And that story was then picked up by the Drudge Report. That's when the mouse references exploded, morphing from a possible project of an unnamed agency to Pence's "$30 million in there to protect mice in San Francisco." We wanted to get to the bottom of this issue and find out what was up with the mouse. Turns out the salt marsh harvest mouse is a previously obscure beneficiary of a major environmental restoration project for the San Francisco Bay area. "A friend e-mailed me and asked me if any of the $30 million for the mouse was for us, and I was like 'What are you talking about?'" said Steve Ritchie, an engineer with the California State Coastal Conservancy, a state agency charged with preserving and restoring the coastline. When the stimulus bill was first proposed and a call went out for ready-to-go projects, Ritchie prepared a list of the agency's shovel-ready projects and submitted it to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, both of which received money in the final version of the stimulus bill. Three projects would turn abandoned industrial salt operations back into natural wetlands, about 26,000 acres in all. It turns out the mouse is an endangered species that likes tidal salt marshes, and it's mentioned by name as one of several species that will benefit. But the projects themselves — the South Bay Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project , the Napa Plant Site , and the Napa Salt Marsh restoration — are intended to do more than just benefit wildlife. It's major construction work to create recreation areas and to restore marshland that will resist flooding and storm surge. "This is bulldozers, front-end loaders, backhoes. These are major earth-moving projects to break down levees, to resculpt the landscape and to make sure nature can do its thing," Ritchie said. "Right now, we just have these lousy little salt pond levees and they break." "These are real jobs, and these are truly ready to go," he added. "We can definitely spend this money for construction by Nov. 30, 2010." Given this description of the projects, which were first reported in the San Jose Mercury News , it's a serious distortion to say there's money in the bill to protect San Francisco mice. The bill doesn't even list the San Francisco projects by name. And the funding agencies — the Corps of Engineers or NOAA — could still decide to fund the projects or not. The bill passed a final vote in the House on Feb. 13, with no Republicans supporting it. So Pelosi did not put an earmark in the bill to save the mice. In fact, there's no money in the bill for mice. For this reason, we rate Pence's remark False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d236e0ab-d760-4d4e-9ade-11675260059b	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-02-13T17:46:11	2009-02-12	['San_Francisco']
pomt-07488	"Politicians and their corporate lobbyists are trying to take away my right to spend my paycheck how I want."	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/13/florida-education-association/teacher-group-claims-paycheck-protection-bills/	Bills that would prohibit government unions from collecting dues through automated payroll deductions and require unions to get authorizations from members to use their dues for political purposes has produced dueling ads from the Florida Chamber of Commerce -- which supports the idea -- and the Florida Education Association -- which opposes it. In a previous item, we looked at the chamber's ad and rated a claim False that unions "take away" union members' money, noting that union membership in Florida is voluntary and that the chamber ad uses misleading imagery. Now, we're looking at the teachers union response. On April 6, 2011, the union launched an ad featuring Leon County elementary school teacher Jamie Bellamy. The ad opens with a clip from the chamber's ad, then shows Bellamy standing in a classroom. Here's what she says. "Don't be fooled, this ad doesn't support teachers. "The special interests behind it are playing politics with my paycheck. Politicians and their corporate lobbyists are trying to take away my right to spend my paycheck how I want. "They shouldn't be telling any of us how to spend our money nor deny anyone the right to be heard. That's what this issue's really about. Politicians denying teachers the same rights as everyone else." In this fact-check, we wanted to focus on the FEA's claim that the bills -- SB 830 and its House companion HB 1021 -- take away teachers' rights to spend their paycheck how they want. As in other items on this subject, we think some explanation of the proposal is warranted since the ad offers little. Supporters of the legislation call the idea "paycheck protection," and say it gives individual union members more power over how their dues money is spent. The law would do two basic things. First, it would prohibit public unions from utilizing payroll deductions, and second, it would require unions to get annual authorizations from members to use their dues for political reasons. The bills essentially would allow workers to be members of the union but opt out of the political arm of the organization. Opponents argue that the House and Senate bills are akin to union busting because it will make it more difficult for unions to collect dues. Opponents also say the bills single out unions when more than 360 organizations currently are authorized by the state to deduct money from workers' paychecks. (That's what Bellamy is trying to get at in the last line of the ad). The bill passed the House 73-40 on March 25, and is pending in the Senate. The question in this fact check, again, is does the legislation take away teachers' rights -- and the rights of other government union members -- to spend their paycheck how they want? The answer is no. The bills only eliminates a method by which union members can spend the money in their paycheck -- automated payroll deduction. Payroll deduction is common for workers. Employees have money taken out of their paychecks to pay for all kinds of things. Some deductions are voluntary: student loans, charitable donations, health insurance, life insurance, union dues. Some deductions are not: taxes, alimony and other court-ordered actions. The state of Florida currently has 364 groups or agencies that have the ability to take money directly from employees' paychecks. Here's the entire list provided to PolitiFact Florida by the state Chief Financial Officer's Office. The bills would remove unions from that list, but it would not prevent them from collecting dues, or from members directing money to the union if they chose. The legislation also does not prohibit union members from using their union fees for political activities. Without the ability to use payroll deductions, unions would have to find another way to collect union dues -- possibly through an automated deduction set-up between the union and members' individual banks, or maybe through members writing checks. "We sought to point out that the legislation in question seeks to stop unions -- and only unions – from using payroll deduction," said FEA spokesman Mark Pudlow. "Florida is a right-to-work state and members choose to join a union and pay dues of their own free will. No one forces them to do so. The same can be said of all of the other goods and services that teachers and other government employees may purchase through payroll deduction." "What Jamie Bellamy says in the ad reflects these ideas. Her choice, and the choice of every other public-sector employee in the state, to use payroll deduction as an easy and convenient way to pay their union dues would be taken away if this legislation passes. She would still have the choice to use payroll deduction for dozens of other services – just not to belong to a professional organization that speaks on behalf of her profession." But Bellamy said something different in the ad. SB 830 and HB 1021 likely will make it more difficult for unions to collect dues, and more burdensome for workers to contribute to their union. But the bills do not stop union members from doing it. The FEA's ad said "politicians and their corporate lobbyists are trying to take away my right to spend my paycheck how I want." But the bills passed by the House and under consideration in the Senate only would change the method, not take away the right all together. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09057	Says Houston’s 18th congressional district has been “gentrified” and is home to “more Anglos than African Americans.”	false	/texas/statements/2010/jun/30/john-faulk/faulk-says-center-city-houston-congressional-distr/	John Faulk, the Republican challenging 8th-term U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, recently hinted that changing demographics give him a leg up in his campaign to unseat the African American Democrat. Saying he has a “secret weapon,” the semi-retired accountant told delegates to the Republican state convention June 12 that his foe's district has been “gentrified” and has “more Anglos than African Americans.” Really? Jackson Lee represents the 18th congressional district, which takes in center-city Houston and a partial ring of outlying neighborhoods. To our initial inquiry, Faulk cited the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for 2008, posted online, which says about 42 percent of the district’s residents that year were white and 38 percent were black. The bureau’s chart doesn’t use the Anglo descriptive Faulk employed at the convention. Following Faulk’s lead, we looked into the district’s past racial mix. In 2000, according to that year's census, the district was home then to 263,371 residents identified as black and 240,745 residents recorded as white. So from 2000 to 2008, it looks like there was a swing toward more white than black residents. Enough said? Maybe not. Jackson Lee’s campaign didn’t respond. But Ed Martin, an Austin Democratic consultant, pointed out that according to the '08 census survey, 41.5 percent of the district’s residents were Hispanic, a reflection, Martin nudged, on the estimate of white residents including many Hispanic residents. That is, the three largest population groups broke down to 38 percent black, 26 percent Hispanic white and 16 percent non-Hispanic white. “African American voters control the district,” Martin said. Could Faulk’s sense of district demographics reflect recent election surprises? It looks like Democrats continue to dominate. In 2002, the first statewide election after the district was redrawn based on 2000 census results, all but one Democrat running statewide drew more than 72 percent of the district’s vote, according to the Texas Legislative Council. In 2008, the most recent statewide election, Democratic candidates -- from the president down the ballot to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals -- drew 75 percent or more of the vote. Next, we asked Lloyd Potter, the state demographer and director of the Institute for Demograhic and Socioeconomic Research at the University of Texas-San Antonio, to weigh the population analyses by Faulk and Martin. Potter said both are correct. Come again? Potter said that white-versus-black is just one way to gauge a population's makeup. At his suggestion, we delved into the bureau’s '08 estimates for the district by clicking on a “show more” hyperlink leading more information about the district's Hispanics. Six in 10 are identified as white; a relatively small percentage are of multiracial heritage such as black or Native-American. Add non-Hispanic whites to Hispanic whites, and the estimated white total (285,634) outnumbers blacks by 12 percent. But remove Hispanic whites from the white total, and the 255,856 black non-Hispanics outnumber the 109,461 white non-Hispanics by 135 percent. Faulk didn’t respond to our efforts to visit afresh; we don’t know if he shook the numbers this way. We asked Potter if any voter analysis of a congressional district would be expected to weigh the district’s share of Hispanic residents. Sure, he replied -- especially in Texas, where the growing share of Latinos can affect elections. And while Potter said it’s still correct to say the overall share of white residents exceeded the share of black residents according to the 2008 census estimate, he added that “some people might be misled . . .because they don’t understand that (the estimate of) whites includes Hispanics.” We’d wager it’s safe to lump most Texans (including us, until now) in that camp. Finally, we probed Faulk’s statement the district has undergone gentrification, which according to Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary means “renewal and rebuilding accompanying the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often displaces poorer residents.” For the 18th district, we presumed, such an influx would be accompanied by significant increases in income over the decade. There’s been no surge, census research suggests. The 2000 census concluded the district’s median household income was $31,291 in 1999. Adjusted for inflation, that amount would have been about $40,000 in 2008. But the 2008 census survey pegged the district’s median household income for that year at $37,133--effectively less than what it had been nine years earlier. In 1999, about 20 percent of district families lived below the federal poverty level, according to the 2000 census. In 2008, 21 percent of families lived below that level, according to the 2008 census survey. All told, Faulk quoted a portion of the '08 census survey that could lead someone to conclude the district's whites outnumber blacks, signaling a boon for any GOP candidate given that minority voters usually favor Democrats. But that conclusion overlooks the fact that Hispanics -- who are also minority voters -- comprise the majority of white residents. Also, the census data yielded no evidence, such as higher incomes, of significant gentrification. Faulk's statement is False.

pomt-13096	"On three occasions, judges had to stop Jason Kander from manipulating elections."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2016/nov/06/roy-blunt/roy-blunt-wrong-about-kander-manipulating-election/	Want a claim about the election being rigged? Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt is accusing his Democratic opponent Jason Kander of trying to manipulate elections while Kander served as Missouri’s secretary of state. "On three occasions, judges had to stop Jason Kander from manipulating elections," Blunt's ad said. Manipulating elections sounds bad. But as we found, the reality is not nearly as simple as Blunt makes it seem. Ballot language The ad cites three cases from the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals as evidence of the manipulation. The appellate court decided the most recent of the three in July. It deals with raising Missouri’s current 17-cent cigarette tax, which appears on this November’s ballot as Amendment 3. In January, Jim Boeving filed suit against Kander and challenged the wording of the measure on the ballot. As the secretary of state, Kander is tasked with crafting the summary statements of ballot measures. This is the summary statement Kander filed: "Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to: Increase taxes on cigarettes each year through 2020, at which point this additional tax will total 60 cents per pack of 20; Create a fee paid by cigarette wholesalers of 67 cents per pack of 20 on certain cigarettes Deposit funds generated by these taxes and fees into a newly established Early Childhood Health and Education Trust Fund?" The appellate court determined that the second bullet point of Kander’s statement was misleading. In his language, Kander doesn’t mention that although the fee would begin at 67 cents, it would increase annually by 3 percent or more, depending on the rate of inflation. "Nothing in the summary statement would . . . alert a voter to this mandatory, perpetual increase," the court said in its ruling. The ad cites another case about ballot language, which was decided in November 2015. The appeals court reviewed an initiative petition that sought to require in-home service providers receiving reimbursement from the state through MO HealthNet, Missouri’s Medicaid provider, to pay a percentage of their revenue to the workers who provide the services. That compensation would be through wages and benefits. The court determined Kander’s ballot language to be insufficient because Kander did not reference MO HealthNet by name. The court also said Kander erred because he categorized "personal care attendants" as "employees" in his language. Unqualified candidate The third case relates to the qualifications of a state House candidate. In March 2014, Natalie Vowell filed a declaration with the secretary of state’s office to run as a state House candidate in the 78th District in the August primary election. Kander’s office initially approved the request. But in May, Kander’s office sent a letter to Vowell questioning her ability to run. In the letter, Kander said voter registration records indicated Vowell had not been a qualified Missouri voter in the two years leading to the election, as required by law. The letter said Vowell would not be on the ballot unless she provided documents proving she was a registered Missouri voter during those two years. Vowell filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief and said Kander’s office did not have the authority to evaluate a candidate’s qualifications for office. The trial court determined that Vowell was indeed ineligible to run for office and dismissed her petition. But the appellate court said Vowell’s eligibility was irrelevant. Instead, the case was a matter of whether the secretary of state had the authority to investigate the qualifications of candidates. The court said in its ruling that Missouri statutes do not grant the secretary of state the power to investigate. Kander’s role was ministerial, the court said. He was only responsible for making sure the potential candidate’s "paperwork is in proper order and was timely filed." Was it manipulation? Blunt claims judges had to stop Kander from "manipulating" elections. "Manipulating" is a strong word, especially when it is used to characterize the nuances and brevity of language the Missouri secretary of state must use to summarize lengthy legislation and constitutional amendments for voters. We consulted experts who noted that crafting ballot language is part of Kander’s job as the secretary of state. Christopher Elmendorf, a law professor at the University of California Davis, said Kander "was exercising a governmental function that he had every right to exercise, though he may have ‘crossed the line’ between permissible and misleading ballot titles." But Elmendorf said Kander’s actions "are very different than accepting bribes, stuffing ballot boxes, or trying to prevent people from voting by threatening them or giving them misleading information about the location of polling places." Richard Reuben, an MU law professor, said though it’s possible Kander purposely tried to mislead voters, the court’s rejection of his ballot language "does not necessarily imply ... malevolent intent." "It would not be surprising for an opposing politician in a close race call to get hyperbolic in calling such error manipulation," Reuben said. "Such is the nature of politics." Our ruling Blunt claimed, "On three occasions, judges had to stop Jason Kander from manipulating elections." This claim is misleading. Courts did object in three cases to decisions Kander made as secretary of state. But the specifics of those cases are much more nuanced than Blunt lets on. And the claim that Kander tried to manipulate the election is, at best, unproven. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7704484f-90ff-483b-8b6c-11a7b86cc5c4	None	Roy Blunt	None	None	None	2016-11-06T00:34:06	2016-08-03	['None']

pomt-06314	"By 2014, there will be one administrator for every teacher on college campuses in the United States."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/14/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-2014-there-will-be-one-administ/	During a Republican presidential debate in Michigan on Nov. 9, 2011, Newt Gingrich denounced the federal student loan program as a way for students to stay in school longer, blindly tolerant of how expensive college has become "because they don't see the cost." Then he cited a surprising statistic. "By 2014," Gingrich said during the debate at Oakland University in Rochester, Mich., "there will be one administrator for every teacher on college campuses in the United States." We located an April story in the print and online literary magazine n+1 that made mention of a similar figure. Author Malcolm Harris wrote, "If current trends continue, the Department of Education estimates that by 2014 there will be more administrators than instructors at American four-year nonprofit colleges." When we contacted Harris for his source, he pointed us to a study by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity, a Washington-based group that studies "the rising costs and stagnant efficiency in higher education." The report said, "The growth of non-instructional staff is so fast that if these job growth trends were to continue, the number of managers and support staff (administration) at four-year, not-for-profit colleges would outnumber instructors by 2014. Using the average annual percentage increase between 1997 and 2007 for each of the three job categories (managers, support staff and instructors) as the respective rate of growth, and combining support staff and managers into one category as administration." To back up this finding, the report cited statistics culled from the Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System, a database produced by the Department of Education. So Gingrich has some support for his claim. An important caveat is that different people may use a different definition of "administrator" in the college setting. In the Center for College Affordability and Productivity study, "administrator" refers to the aggregate of "executive, administrative, and managerial" positions and "other professional staff," including support staff. But that’s a pretty broad definition. Jane Wellman, executive director of the Delta Cost Project, a Washington-based policy group, which has also studied this issue notes that "the ‘professional and technical’ category includes student service people, financial aid administrators, researchers, clinicians, nurses and other hospital employees, computer people, etc. The ‘executive, administrative and managerial’ are the front-line college administrators, and they’re a fairly small category." Complicating matters further is that changes in hiring patterns have meant that the number of instructional personnel has been rising even as total spending on instruction has been rising more slowly than administrative costs. A story published in the Washington Monthly that cited the Delta Cost Project’s work noted that "between 1998 and 2008, America’s private colleges increased spending on instruction by 22 percent while increasing spending on administration and staff support by 36 percent." Yet somewhat paradoxically, faculty represented a growing share of college employees between 2000 and 2008, mostly because of increases in hiring of part-time faculty. "One of the major trends in college staffing is the growth in part-time instructors relative to full-time instructors," said Daniel L. Bennett, research fellow at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity The author of the Washington Monthly article, Johns Hopkins University political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg, wrote that if universities gave faculty members more influence and let them handle more administrative work in addition to teaching, "more resources might be available for educational programs and student support, the actual items for which parents, donors, and funding agencies think they are paying." A final point: Much of the teaching load at universities today is handled by graduate students rather than faculty members. Our ruling Gingrich said during the debate that "by 2014, there will be one administrator for every teacher on college campuses in the United States." A study by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity backs up that claim. But it uses a broad definition of "administrator," and narrower definitions would make the statement incorrect. In addition, faculty represented a growing share of college employees between 2000 and 2008, in part because of the growth in part-time instructors. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-14987	"Every other major country" has family paid leave.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-every-other-major-country-has-/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders defended his record as a democratic socialist by calling for the United States to bring its family leave policy in line with other countries. "You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not gonna separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth," he said during the first Democratic presidential debate. We will put aside the narrower question of medical leave and focus on family leave. United States lags behind on paid leave A spokesman for Sanders pointed to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which studied paid maternity leave for about 34 OECD countries -- advanced nations -- and seven additional European Union countries. On average across OECD countries, mothers are entitled to 17 weeks of paid maternity leave. However, the United States is the only country to offer no statutory entitlement to paid leave on a national basis. Another widely respected source of data on this topic is the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations. It found in 2014 that out of 170 countries, all but two provide cash benefits to women during maternity leave: the United States and Papua New Guinea. In the United States, under the federal Family Medical Leave Act, employers with 50 or more workers must allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition. While that law protects their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid. Some employers choose to offer paid leave. About 13 percent of workers had access to some kind of paid family leave in 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s a very low rate compared to the rest of the developed world. Of 41 other developed economies, the United States also mandates the shortest period of unpaid leave — 12 weeks. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom and Australia each allow a full year off (though not all of it is paid). But some countries exclude certain groups of workers such as those who hold temporary or part-time positions or work on farms, as domestics, police, armed forces or civil servants. In some cases, such as domestic workers, the laws don’t explicitly explain if the leave policies apply or not, while explicit legal exclusion of farm workers has been identified in at least 27 countries. The International Labor Organization recommends that countries provide these benefits: women should receive at least 14 weeks off; they should be reimbursed at least two-thirds of their previous earnings; and the benefit should be paid almost entirely by the state through public funds or Social Security. The United States is the only developed country to meet none of the benchmarks. Why does the United States lag behind Explaining the reasons why the United States lags behind other countries is rooted in historical and political factors. We interviewed Vicki Shabo, a vice president at the National Partnership for Women and Families, one of many organizations advocating for more family leave for both women and men. Here is a graphic from the partnership showing the timeline of how other nations established paid leave: The United States has a weaker tradition of social welfare compared with other countries such as Germany. There was a push for family leave during times of war in Europe, when men went off to war and women were needed in the workforce. Although women did go to work in the United states during World War II, they generally went back into the home at the end of the war. "We missed this historical window and never really caught up," Shabo said. In some other countries, unions have played a stronger role in creating leave policies. Experts said that the political power of the business lobby has helped prevent changes to family leave law. "The absence of paid leave, paid vacation, and national health insurance all reflect a long history of a business-dominated political economy," said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist at City University of New York. There has been scant legislative action to change the policy here. In March, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., introduced the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act to allow 60 qualified caregiving days per year, but it hasn’t received a vote. Sanders is one of 19 co-sponsors, all of them are Democrats. (Sanders is an independent in the Senate but running for president as a Democrat.) Our ruling Sanders said "every other major country" has family paid leave. Two comprehensive studies of multiple nations backup Sanders’ point that the United States is an outlier when it comes to paid family leave. One study found that the United States is the only country to offer no statutory entitlement to paid leave on a national basis. A separate study of more countries found that the United States and Papua New Guinea were the only two not to provide cash benefits to women during maternity leave. The only caveat here is that family leave isn’t a universal benefit in some countries, due to exclusions on certain workers. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09594	There are "high administrative costs" when you donate to Haiti relief through the White House Web site.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/20/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-claims-white-house-benefits-haiti-donatio/	After an earthquake hit Haiti last week, Rush Limbaugh made a series of controversial claims about the disaster, which killed tens of thousands and devastated the infrastructure and institutions of the poor Caribbean nation. On the Jan. 13, 2010, edition of his show, Limbaugh said President Barack Obama's administration would use the quake to "build 'credibility' with the black community -- in the both light-skinned and dark-skinned black community in this country." He claimed Americans have "already donated to Haiti. It's called the U.S. income tax." While talking with a caller, he cast doubt on whether money donated through Whitehouse.gov would end up in Haiiti, and said the people who did donate through the White House would find their e-mail addresses receiving fundraising appeals from Obama. On Monday, he suggested that the White House was somehow acting as a middleman for donations and then skimming off a high percentage for administrative costs. Limbaugh noted the criticisms of the charity run by Wyclef Jean ("Is Wyclef Jean a rap star or is he just reggae kind of music?" Limbaugh asked) has high administrative costs. "What about the administrative costs of donating through WhiteHouse.gov, for crying out loud?" Limbaugh asked. "Do you know that one of the reasons the welfare budget is as high as it is -- and these numbers are I guess 10 years old, but in 1999, maybe earlier than that, for every dollar that was budgeted for welfare or food stamps, AFDC, whatever it is, 28 cents of it was spent on administering it, so 72 cents out of every dollar got there. I mean the high administrative costs are actually when you donate through the government," he said. "I don't know of a president ever who has asked people to donate to a relief effort through a White House Web site. It's never happened before. ... Nobody here ever said don't donate. We just pointed out you already contribute to the government with your income taxes. If you want to donate above and beyond that, go through a charity that's constantly on the ground in Haiti, or the Red Cross, if you want to go that route or whatever. Nobody said do not donate, which is what is being reported." In one respect, Limbaugh is right: He never said Americans shouldn't donate to Haiti. He did say to do it through private groups. But his point here was that the White House was somehow acting as an inefficient middleman. That got us wondering: Would donating through WhiteHouse.gov be inefficient compared with donating directly to the Red Cross or some other charitable organization? Do "high administrative costs" happen "when you donate through the government"? Instead of helping the people displaced by the quake, would the money instead be used to pay government salaries? We started looking around and discovered this: You never could actually donate through WhiteHouse.gov. On seemingly every White House Web page that mentions Haiti, there is a link to the Red Cross or the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund. (There are no links to Wyclef Jean's group.) But those are just links to those sites -- not some kind of PayPal for the Obama White House. "I can confirm that we are not processing/have never processed any donations to Haiti through whitehouse.gov, but are just directing folks to other groups," White House spokesman Matt Lehrich wrote in an e-mail. Lehrich also said there was no overhead being delivered to the White House nor the federal government, and that e-mail addresses of donors to the Red Cross or the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund wouldn't be shared. So it makes no difference whether you click the link from WhiteHouse.gov or go directly to the groups' own sites. To address Limbaugh's point that some charities make more efficient use of donations than others, we checked to see how the ones recommended on the White House site stack up. We looked at Charity Navigator, a Web site that grades and ranks charities. It gives the Red Cross a rating of three stars out of four. The Clinton-Bush Haiti fund, a joint effort of Bush's Communities Foundation of Texas and Clinton's William J. Clinton Foundation, was only formed last weekend and doesn't have a rating yet. But the William J. Clinton Foundation has a full four-star rating, and the Communities Foundation earned three stars. We looked at another charity ranking system, the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance. The American Red Cross made its list of recommended Haiti charities. But the Clinton Foundation only fulfilled 13 of the 20 standards for charity accountability. The Communities Foundation hasn't been rated yet. In comparison, Wyclef Jean's Yele Foundation, which sparked Limbaugh's complaint, isn't rated by Charity Navigator. But in a blog post, the organization seems skeptical of Yele. The Wise Giving Alliance doesn't have a rating for Yele, but its director told the Associated Press the organization was "questionable." (Jean has defended the organization.) So Limbaugh is seriously distorting the truth, suggesting that people can donate through the White House when in fact the White House site has simply posted links to groups that earn generally positive ratings. There's no evidence the White House is using any of these donations for administrative costs, and the charities aren't sharing donors' e-mail addresses with the White House. Limbaugh is making a ridiculously false claim that the Obama administration is capitalizing on a tragedy. That's enough to set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire!

pomt-03538	"In our community college system (state) cuts have reduced funding per student by $1,908."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2013/may/28/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-state-support-community-college-stu/	Terry McAuliffe says students at Virginia’s 23 community colleges have taken a hit from state budget cuts. "In our community college system, cuts have reduced funding per student by $1,908," the Democratic gubernatorial nominee says on his campaign website. We wondered whether McAuliffe’s figure is correct. McAuliffe’s website says state funding per community college student fell from $4,418 in 2008 to $2,510 in 2012 -- a $1,908 drop. Josh Schwerin, a McAuliffe campaign spokesman, told us the numbers came from State Council on Higher Education for Virginia figures on instructional spending and the campaign adjusted them to 2012 dollars. The numbers reflect the amount spent per in-state community college student from Virginia’s general fund, which is raised from taxes. We found two glitches in McAuliffe’s calculation. First, his figures include Richard Bland College, a two-year institution that’s not part of the 23-school community college system. The second problem was that we could not reproduce McAuliffe’s calculations when we did our own math with SCHEV data. That’s because not all of McAuliffe’s numbers were adjusted to 2012 dollars, as Schwerin said. We learned that the campaign adjusted some of the data to 2014 dollars. So what are the real numbers? We got our own data from SCHEV and set all the figures in 2012 dollars. We found that adjusted general fund spending was about $4,275 per in-state community college student during the 2007-08 school year and $2,583 during the 2011-12 year. That’s a decline of $1,692 per student -- somewhat shy of McAuliffe’s $1,908 figure. Another part of McAuliffe’s statement also needs examination. He attributes the reduction to budget cuts, but that’s not the entire reason. State lawmakers, seeking to keep the budget balanced during and after the Great Recession, cut all major services supported by the general fund: education, health and public service. Appropriations for the community college system for instructional programs fell from $372.5 million for the 2007-08 school year to $316.2 million in 2011-12. During the same span, the number of people attending community colleges sharply rose -- from 101,889 full-time equivalent students during 2007-08 to 129,652 in 2011-12, according to figures from the Virginia Community College System. About 95 percent of the students were Virginia residents, according to Jeffrey Kraus, a spokesman for the system. Much of the increase, he said, was driven by the recession as workers entered community colleges to train for second careers and younger students sought a more affordable higher education than attending a four-year college. So state funding was falling while the student population was rising. The community colleges addressed the strain by raising tuition -- from an average of $2,390 for an in-state student during the 2007-08 school year to $3,556 in 2011-12. Finally, we should note that 2011-12 is the latest school year for which SCHEV has firm numbers for the number of people attending community colleges and the state’s support for each student. Our ruling McAuliffe said budget cuts reduced state spending per in-state community college student by $1,908 between 2008 and 2012. There are mistakes in his calculation that inflate his figure. The actual decline was just shy of $1,700 per student. McAuliffe’s statement attributed the reduction to state budget cuts. That’s a plausible contention because the General Assembly, combating an economic turndown, slashed community college funding by 15 percent during the years in question. But that’s not the entire story. What McAuliffe didn’t mention is that the budget cuts were compounded by a 27 percent increase in enrollment in community colleges and those two events combined to cause the steep drop in per-student funding. So McAuliffe’s statement needs clarifications but his gist -- that during an era of budget cutting, state funding per community college student significantly shrank -- holds up. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Terry McAuliffe	None	None	None	2013-05-28T12:30:00	2013-05-06	['None']

pomt-02592	"Over half of the young people" in medical, dental and law schools are women.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/28/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-more-half-students-medical-dental-a/	Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee’s attempt to speak on women’s issues at a meeting of the Republican National Committee last week drew as much attention, if not more, than the party’s official business. At the meeting, Huckabee accused Democrats of believing that women "cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government." On CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a possible 2016 presidential hopeful, was asked to weigh in on Huckabee’s comments. He turned the question to female advancement in education and the workplace. "I've seen the women in my family and how well they're doing," Paul said. "My niece is in Cornell Vet School, and 85 percent of the people in vet school right now are women. Over half of the young people in medical school and dental school are women. Law school, the same way. I think women are doing very well, and I'm proud of how well we've come and how far we've come, and I think that some of the victimology and all this other stuff is trumped up." Host Candy Crowley didn’t press Paul on his comment about women and advanced degrees, but we decided to weigh in. By the numbers Women are indeed seeking advanced degrees at rates that far outpace men — in fact, that has been the case for many years. In 1990, males made up 53 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds with an advanced degree (that is, a master’s degree or higher). By 2000, the percentages had flipped, with women holding 58 percent of post-bachelor’s degrees among the same demographic, according to the U.S. Census. The breakdown remained similar in 2009. Paul’s problem was that he happened to choose specific fields — medicine, dentistry and law — where the statistics tell a different story. Let’s start with medicine. In 2013, 83,472 individuals were enrolled in medical schools across the United States, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. About 38,950 were women, or 46.7 percent. That’s close to half, but not quite. And the percentage of women in med school actually dropped over the past decade. In 2004, women made up 48.2 percent of the 70,816 med school enrollees. Now let’s move on to dental school. As it turns out, dentistry numbers are pretty similar to medical colleges. According to an American Dental Association education survey, there were 11,613 men in dental schools in 2010-11, and 10,240 women, or about 46.9 percent of enrollees. Unlike what happened in med school, the gender gap has shrunk in dental school over the past 10 years. In 2001-02, the dental school population was 40 percent female and 60 percent male. Finally, we turn to the law. In law school, men make up the majority, as well, and at rates similar to medicine and dentistry. According to the American Bar Association, there were 146,288 people enrolled in a juris doctorate program in 2011-12 and 68,262, or 46.7 percent, were women. Participation rates among women in law schools are far higher than they were in 1950, when they made up just 3 percent of enrollees. By 1980, females made up 35 percent of all law school campuses. But as was the case with medical school, the share of women in law school has actually declined somewhat in recent years. In 1992-93, women were a slight majority of law school students, at 50.4 percent of enrollees. From 2002 to 2004, they were close at 49.0 percent. Since 2006, they have hovered around 47 percent. So Paul’s claim is 0-for-3. We reached out to Paul’s office and they pointed us to an American Enterprise Institute study. The research backed up the overall trend in higher education we already pointed out — women are earning more advanced degrees than men — but it didn’t weigh on the specific fields Paul singled out. We checked out one more possibility: Were women a minority of enrollees, but a majority of those who ultimately earned degrees, because more men were washing out before graduation? We found that’s not the case either. In 2011-12, more men than women finished their medical, dental and law school programs, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. For the record, there are three fields that require specific advanced degrees where women do outnumber men. Of the degrees earned in optometry and pharmacy in 2012, two-thirds went to women, and about 78 percent of veterinary degrees went to females. In the others — dentistry, medicine, osteopathic medicine, podiatry, chiropractic, law and theology — men were the majority. Our ruling Paul said more than half of the enrollees in medical, dentistry and law schools are female. While women are close to 50 percent of enrollees in all three fields, they’re not a majority in any of them. And in both law and medicine, the trendlines for female enrollment have actually fallen in recent years. We rate Paul’s statement False.

pomt-14836	Taking all the money of the top 1 percent wouldn’t keep Medicare going for three years.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/nov/19/neil-cavuto/foxs-cavuto-stacks-medicare-spending-against-wealt/	Fox Business Network host Neil Cavuto put a college organizer in the hot seat when she came on his show to talk about the need to reduce college debt. Cavuto pressed Keely Mullen with the Million Student March on how she would pay for a program to make public college tuition-free, forgive all current college debt and pay college students $15 an hour. "If you wanted all that stuff, someone has to pick up the tab," Cavuto asked on his Nov. 12 show. "Who would that be?" "The 1 percent of society that are hoarding all the wealth and causing a catastrophe that students are facing," Mullen answered. Cavuto pushed back and presented Mullen with this scenario to demonstrate the limits of getting the wealthy to pony up. "They’ve done studies on this, Keely," Cavuto said. "I don’t want to get boring here. But even if you were to take the 1 percent, and take all of their money, tax it 100 percent. Do you know it wouldn’t keep Medicare -- just Medicare -- going for three years? " Several readers asked us to check Cavuto’s basic math. Could the wealthiest 1 percent pay for Medicare for three years or not? We don’t want to get boring either, but reader be warned: Numbers, multiplication and subtraction lie ahead. We asked the Fox Business Network for studies backing up Cavuto’s math. The Fox press office didn’t point us to any studies. Instead, a spokeswoman explained that Cavuto and his producer averaged the yearly income going to the top 1 percent as reported by the Internal Revenue Service for 2011, 2012 and 2013. They came up with "about $1.75 trillion." For the cost of Medicare, they went to two sources: The Kaiser Family Foundation, which we’ll get to in a moment, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services web page on national health expenditures for 2013. That page gave them the figure of $585.7 billion of Medicare expenditures. They multiplied the Medicare number by three and found that it would be $1.755 trillion over three years. The correct number is actually $1.757 trillion, but the point remains the same. Using Cavuto’s estimate, three years of Medicare spending is more than all the money the top 1 percent took in. We tried to repeat Cavuto’s analysis and ran into some issues. Problems with the Medicare dollars Cavuto’s Medicare spending number is not bulletproof. There are credible, lower figures. Medicare spending is reported in two ways: Gross outlays and net outlays. Gross outlays are basically money out the door, and net outlays reduces the total based on the money Medicare takes in apart from the federal budget and the payroll tax. We found a discrepancy in the gross outlay number. While the CMS fact sheet does report $585.7 billion in gross spending, the Medicare Trustees, the program’s overseers, reported a slightly lower $582.9 billion for 2013. Since that comes from the Trustees' official report to Congress, we gave it some weight. (The difference is due to accounting rules.) We also found that the other source cited by Fox Business, the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is widely seen as a neutral source of health care data, focuses on the net outlays, not the gross spending. Fox Business directed us to the foundation’s Medicare fact-sheet. That page reports the net figure, which factors in billions of dollars of premiums paid by Medicare users, along with recaptured inappropriate payments to providers. For 2013, Kaiser reported net spending of $492 billion. Juliette Cubanski, a top Medicare analyst at Kaiser, explained that the net amount does a better job of capturing the burden on taxpayers as a whole. "Showing the gross spending amount would, in a way, overstate federal spending on Medicare because some of that amount comes back to the Treasury in the form of premiums," Cubanski said. So the Medicare Trustees provided a slightly lower number than Cavuto used, and his other source provided a significantly lower number. Both measures put his math at risk. Problems with the top 1 percent dollars Cavuto used IRS data for 2011, 2012 and 2013. It’s easy to find the IRS analysis of the Adjusted Gross Income, or AGI, for the top 1 percent for 2011 and 2012. But the official analysis only comes out about three years after the fact, and the 2013 numbers are not available. So where did Cavuto get an estimate for 2013 income? His staff said he used an IRS spreadsheet for 2013. However, this only gives you a rough approximation, and when we compared past spreadsheets to the official analyses for 2011 and 2012, we found significant differences. Nonetheless, there is another issue with Cavuto’s income figure. Adjusted Gross Income misses a fair chunk of the money people actually make. There are many deductions in taxable income that come before taxpayers reaches that point in their tax returns. One of the largest takes the form of tax-free contributions to a retirement account. In a perfect world, one would be able to say precisely the actual incomes, before any deductions, of the top 1 percent. In practice, that turns out to be a tricky business, said Daniel Feenberg, a tax expert at the National Bureau of Economic Research. "There are many ways to do this calculation, including many that are correct but differ from each other," Feenberg said. The Tax Policy Center, a joint effort of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, has a method to estimate what it calls the "cash income" of tax filers. Its model adds back in the dollars put into a retirement account, along with non-taxable Social Security and pension income, and various other pots of money. Averaging the center’s estimates of cash income for the top 1 percent for 2011, 2012 and 2013 produces a total of $1.85 trillion. That’s about $100 billion more than Cavuto’s estimate for the top 1 percent. The center’s co-director William Gale warned us that using tax returns to measure income totally misses a major source of income for the top 1 percent: gains on financial holdings that accrue but aren’t cashed out. "When Warren Buffett’s stocks go up up by X billion over a year, none of that shows up in his AGI unless he sells some of the assets," Gale said. Setting aside the huge policy debate involved here, measuring income in any given year is a particularly poor yardstick for the financial capacity of the top 1 percent. Way more than most people, they get to decide when to turn their wealth into income. Running the numbers For the last step of this fact-check, we stress-tested Cavuto’s assertion. The math is simple: You triple a given Medicare spending number and subtract that from an income estimate. We did the math using three different amounts for Medicare spending and three different estimates of the income of the top 1 percent. For the IRS, we use the most recent available AGI figure from 2012. (We know that due to efforts to avoid higher capital gains taxes, many people sold assets in 2012. This artificially raised the AGI figure that year, but we’ve yet to find a report that shows the size of that effect in terms of the income of the top 1 percent.) With that caveat, here is the table -- using all the sources above -- showing what you’re left with when you take one year of income for the 1 percent and subtract the three-year cost of Medicare. A negative number means the Medicare total was more than the income -- as Cavuto said. The green background is where Cavuto is correct. The red is where he is not. The amounts are in billions of dollars. There’s only one outcome that supports Cavuto’s assertion that the income of the 1 percent wouldn’t pay for three years of Medicare spending — the one that uses his own sources. The remaining eight scenarios based on other reputable sources show the income of the 1 percent exceeding three years of Medicare spending, ranging from a difference of $1.3 billion to $504 billion. Cavuto’s method is very sensitive to small shifts in the numbers. Even using his income estimate but relying on the gross spending figure from the Medicare Trustees, he missed the mark. Not by much, but his assertion is still not right. The gap only gets wider if you use any other estimate of income and any other Medicare spending amount. If you use the Kaiser Family Foundation’s number for Medicare ($492 billion) and the the Tax Policy Center’s number for income ($1.85 trillion), the money from the wealthiest 1 percent would cover Medicare for about three years and nine months. Our ruling Cavuto said that one year of the income of the top 1 percent would not pay for three years of Medicare. His point was that the financial capacity of the top 1 percent is not unlimited. He bolstered his point with a definitive statement, but the underlying math is flawed. Cavuto used the highest number we could find for the cost of Medicare. While he may have relied on an official web page for his Medicare number, we found an equally official source, the Medicare Trustees, that reported a lower figure. That small difference in itself made his claim incorrect. Other measures of Medicare spending made it even more incorrect. His income figure, based on an approach he never fully described, is guaranteed to undercount the actual income of the top 1 percent. There is a sliver of accuracy in his calculation, but the weight of the numbers goes against him. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-07541	"Some of the colleges, including A&M, have already guaranteed that they will not increase their tuition."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/apr/04/jimmie-don-aycock/texas-rep-jimmie-don-aycock-says-some-colleges-inc/	During debate over legislation that cuts about $1.5 billion in spending from the state’s current budget, state Rep. Sylvester Turner spoke in favor of an amendment that would have redirected $6.2 million from programs under the purview of Gov. Rick Perry to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which administers state-funded student financial aid programs. On the House floor March 31, Turner, a Houston Democrat, said that after expected reductions in funding for higher education, "students in the state of Texas will need more financial aid than ever before because their tuition will go up. … Why are we more interested in protecting the governor’s agency than in providing financial aid to our students?" Republican Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock of Killeen, an opponent of the amendment, responded by defending the programs handled by the governor’s office and indicating that tuition hikes are not a done deal: "Some of the colleges, including A&M, have already guaranteed that they will not increase their tuition." The amendment failed, but we still wondered whether Texas A&M University and other colleges have really decided to freeze their tuition, as Perry urged in his February State of the State address. On Feb. 9, the day after Perry’s speech, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that "at least one public university system had already decided to freeze tuition." Texas A&M’s board of regents "last year voted to freeze tuition rates for the 2011-12 academic year at 11 universities," according to the news article. Texas A&M spokesman Jason Cook confirmed that the university system had frozen "designated" tuition — what public universities charge students on top of state-set tuition — but he said A&M’s flagship university in College Station is proposing to raise additional tuition for three of its colleges: architecture, engineering and veterinary medicine. Cook told us the proposed hike only applies to certain undergraduates — about 1,415 architecture students, 7,880 engineering students and 510 students in a veterinary medicine program. Total enrollment last fall on the College Station campus was 49,426, so about 20 percent of students would pay the higher charges. A&M President Bowen Loftin will take the proposal to the university’s board of regents in May, Cook said — a year from when the board decided not to raise university-wide tuition this fall. Tuition won’t go up at the other universities in the A&M system, Cook said, but fees may go up. According to the an overview of tuition by the coordinating board, mandatory fees, such as library and laboratory fees, are charged to all students upon enrollment. Texas A&M University at College Station is proposing "a small increase in three mandatory fees," he said. When he spoke on the House floor, Aycock said that A&M was among "some of the colleges" that have promised to freeze tuition. When we checked back with the lawmaker, he told us that he was only talking about institutions within the A&M system. Still, we think Texans who heard him could be left with the impression that some other public colleges in Texas had guaranteed tuition freezes. We looked for such pledges — unsuccessfully. Searching news articles, we discovered that the governing boards at three public higher education institutions had voted within the past two weeks to increase tuition and fees this fall at some campuses, including the University of North Texas in Denton, Del Mar community college in Corpus Christi and Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls. In each case, projected cuts to state funding were a factor in the board’s decision to implement the increases. Representatives of Texas Tech and the University of Houston also told us that fall tuition could be raised. What about the University of Texas system? The Austin American-Statesman reported in a March 3 story that the new chairman of the system’s board of regents, Gene Powell, has pledged to try to hold tuition at current levels or even lower. In Feb. 18 remarks to the board, Powell said: "We are going to lower the cost (of a bachelor’s degree) if we can do it in any way." UT regents typically set tuition every two years. In March 2010, they voted to increase tuition and fee rates at most of the system’s institutions for both this school year and next. During that meeting, regents did not increase the 2011-12 cost of attending the system’s medical, dental and nursing health campuses but signaled that they would revisit the question the following year. And last month, they raised the tuition at those institutions. In a press release announcing the March 2010 vote, UT regents left the door open to consider an additional increase for this fall "should available funding change." Because tuition recommendations originate at individual campuses, we checked with UT-Austin to see whether any increases for the fall are being considered. Robert Meckel, director of public affairs at the school, told us that "there will be no proposal for a tuition increase" for the next school year. We also asked Matt Flores, a spokesman for the UT System, whether any UT institutions had "guaranteed" that they wouldn’t raise tuition for the following school year, 2012-13. "No," he said. "That’s too speculative right now." So, where does that leave us? In his remarks on the House floor, Aycock said "some colleges" including Texas A&M have pledged not to increase tuition costs to students. That’s not quite what we found. It’s true that all but one of the A&M system’s campuses won’t be seeing tuition increases this fall. But 20 percent of students at the system’s flagship campus may have to pay higher tuition, and all A&M students could face mandatory fee increases. Outside the A&M family, we found no evidence of tuition freezes — instead we found impending tuition hikes. We rate Aycock’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10011	On whether he wrote a provision that allowed AIG to dole out bonuses.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/23/chris-dodd/Dodd-flip-flop-AIG-bonuses/	Sen. Chris Dodd has been widely panned as the man responsible for allowing bailout recipient AIG to hand out huge bonuses, but it's really a half truth to say he's to blame. Dodd was actually the author of a provision that limited bonuses for AIG and other financial companies, though it's true that he later added a loophole that allowed some bonuses. Nevertheless, in the course of explaining his role in the matter, Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, committed one of this year’s most conspicuous flip-flops. As keepers of the Flip-O-Meter, we feel obligated to document it. Here’s what happened: As word of AIG’s bonuses filtered out, critics zeroed in on an amendment Congress passed in February that outlawed such bonuses but exempted contracts signed before Feb. 11, 2009. The amendment prohibited firms that had received federal bailout money from "paying or accruing any bonus" to the 25 most highly compensated employees as long as the company still owed the government money for the bailout. But somewhere in the legislative process, a line was added to say the amendment "shall not be construed to prohibit any bonus payment required to be paid pursuant to a written employment contract executed on or before February 11, 2009." The extra line allowed AIG to hand out $165 million in bonuses for 2008 to executives of a division that lost piles of money that year. Dodd had authored the original amendment. So CNN asked him on March 18 whether he was the one who added the Feb. 11 effective date. "There is the suggestion today being made that you received more money from AIG than any other senator, and that you were responsible for the February 11th, 2009, date," CNN producer Ted Barrett said to Dodd on March 18. "So, just — you know, again, I just want to get at ..." "No," Dodd said. "You're saying you had nothing to do with that date?" Barrett pressed. "Absolutely not," Dodd said. That was pretty clear. And yet a day later, with other sources telling CNN that Dodd was in fact the one who made the change, Dodd admitted as much. "I agreed to a modification in the legislation, reluctantly," he told CNN's Dana Bash. "I wasn't negotiating with myself here. I wasn't changing my own amendment. I was changing the amendment because others were insisting upon it." "You were very adamant yesterday, very adamant that you didn't know how this change got in there," Bash said. "And now you are saying that your staff did work with the administration?" "Going back and looking — obviously, I apologize," Dodd said. Treasury officials later confirmed they had asked Dodd to change the amendment because they were afraid executives would sue if it was retroactive. In a press conference , Dodd stressed that he was the one who authored the bonus restrictions in the first place, and that Treasury requested the change. "I'm angry about it, and angry that in a sense I've been held up as sort of responsible for all this when in fact I responded to what I thought was a reasonable request at the time," Dodd said. "I went through six weeks of a lot of criticism from the financial press, from Wall Street and others that my amendment was too restrictive, that it was unfair, that there would be a brain drain, that people would leave right and left." Still, it was Dodd who chose to insert the loophole. For his 180-degree switch from steadfast denier to contrite confessor, the Flip-O-Meter registers a Full Flop.

pomt-08242	$65 billion "would be added to the deficit if we keep the cuts for people on the highest incomes."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/14/mark-warner/warner-says-deficit-would-grow-65-billion-if-we-ke/	Sen. Mark Warner is pitching a plan that would allow some Bush-era tax cuts to expire as scheduled and apply the additional tax revenue toward business tax cuts and incentives to spur the economy. Laying out his plan in an Op-Ed in the Financial Times, Warner notes that a Republican-Democrat compromise is being considered by the Obama administration that would temporarily extend all the tax breaks for two more years. "However, this latter approach has problems beyond the $65bn that would be added to the deficit if we keep the cuts for people on the highest incomes," Warner writes. "In Washington such ‘temporary’ benefits also have a strange way of becoming permanent." Since Warner’s own plan hinges on reapplying the $65 billion in additional tax revenue that would come from allowing the tax breaks for the wealthy to expire, we thought it prudent to check the figure. Asked for the source, Warner’s communication director Kevin Hall pointed to estimates by the U.S. Treasury. Those projections show that allowing the cuts to expire along with adjustments to the capital gains and dividends would amount to $74.4 billion over two years. Here’s why we mention that factor: If the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire as scheduled, the top tax rate on long-term capital gains would rise from 15 percent to 20 percent. Dividends, which are currently taxed at 15 percent, would be taxed at the same rates as ordinary income with a top rate of 39.9 percent. But if we look exclusively at allowing the Bush cuts to expire, it’s $62.5 billion for the two years. Hall said Warner excludes the capital gains and dividends change because they might not be enacted, "and capital gains isn’t really what people talk about when they say ‘income taxes.’" Gerald Prante, senior economist with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, disagreed on that point. He also suggested looking at more recent figures from the Office of Management and Budget, noting that the Treasury numbers are based upon estimates that have since been revised. The OMB figures show that allowing the cuts for the wealthy to expire would generate more than $66 billion in tax revenue over two years. But that’s including the adjustment to the capital gains. Without it, the two-year total is closer to $57 billion. Its worth noting, however, that the numbers from both sources look at the revenue to be gained from repealing the tax cuts permanently as opposed to eliminating them after a two-year extension. "If there was only a two-year extension, the cost may not be $66 billion as [the] Joint Committee on Taxation/Treasury would assume tax planning that could change the costs, moving income between years," noted Prante. "But overall, Warner's claim is fine...the $65 billion figure is not an exaggeration." So, if we use the Treasury’s numbers, and look exclusively at the tax revenue raised by the two years worth of repealed cuts for the wealthy, then Warner is very close. Using the more recent OMB figures, he’d be nearer by including the capital gains adjustment, but is still in the neighborhood. Accepting that pinpointing a number using evolving projections is not an exact science, we find Warner’s claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-12157	U.S. Sen. John McCain "was singlehandedly responsible for starting a fire on (the) USS Forrestal aircraft carrier."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/07/blog-posting/posts-blame-john-mccain-deadly-1967-fire-aboard-us/	Several websites have dredged up erroneous details of a deadly naval accident to smear U.S. Sen. John McCain’s service record after his vote against a GOP health care bill. Calling McCain "a traitor and disgrace to the American People," an Aug. 6, 2017, post on WorldNewsCircle.com attacks the Arizona Republican for his role in a 1967 fire on the USS Forrestal during the Vietnam War. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. They also highlighted similar posts on some other sites. Appearing after McCain derailed GOP efforts on July 28 to pass a bill in the Senate repealing the Affordable Care Act, the article blames the then-U.S. Navy pilot for the blaze. "McCain train wreck career met an all time low when he was singlehandedly responsible for starting a fire on USS Forrestal Aircraft Carrier," the post read. "The accident claimed the lives of 134 sailors and left permanently disabled another 161 who were dismissed from active duty." The essay said McCain "decided to practice a reckless maneuver that day called a wet start," in which a pilot sends extra fuel to a jet’s thrusters to create a showy flame on takeoff. The post said that wet start ignited an adjacent plane’s missiles, which fired and hit "multiple planes filled with explosives all through the carrier’s deck." (Still more internet posts have been saying McCain dropped his plane’s own bombs on the deck, causing the explosions, or that McCain abandoned the deck prematurely.) This charge has been leveled against McCain before, as the event did come up during his 2008 presidential campaign. But official reports and other accounts don’t support the assertion that he was responsible. Fire aboard the Forrestal McCain was aboard the Forrestal as a lieutenant commander piloting an A-4 Skyhawk for the U.S. Navy on July 29, 1967, the day of the fire. The Forrestal had recently been resupplied with munitions, including 1,000-pound bombs from the Korean War, stored on the deck, because modern bombs were in short supply. McCain’s jet was parked on the deck, tail pointed outward before takeoff, as the ship sailed in the Gulf of Tonkin. McCain didn’t "wet start" his jet, but rather an F-4 Phantom about 100 feet away at the opposite end of the deck accidentally fired a rocket because of an electrical surge. The details vary depending on the account, but the rocket hit either McCain’s plane or the plane of fellow Skyhawk pilot Lt. Cdr. Fred White. Our friends at FactCheck.org found that McCain’s own statements immediately after the disaster showed him admitting his memory of the event was muddled. McCain remembered the rocket hitting his own plane in Chapter 14 of his 1999 book Faith of My Fathers: "In the next instant, a Zuni missile struck the belly fuel tank of my plane, tearing it open, igniting two hundred gallons of fuel that spilled onto the deck, and knocking two of my bombs to the deck." But the official U.S. Navy report of the accident said the rocket hit White’s plane, rupturing the fuel tank and igniting the jet fuel. A fragment also punctured the fuel tank of another Skyhawk next to White, spilling more fuel and igniting it. The rocket itself fell into the ocean without detonating, but a bomb from one of the aircraft exploded as crew members rushed to put out the flames. (Subsequent reports have noted modern bombs would not have "cooked off" the way the Korean War-era munitions did, contributing to the disaster.) Gregory Freeman, author of the 2002 book Sailors to the End, has sided with McCain’s account, but conceded on his website that it was entirely possible the rocket hit both Skyhawks. Narrated video of the event showing the explosion is available on YouTube: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com McCain managed to escape his cockpit through the flames, suffering burns and shrapnel wounds in his legs and chest. He described the conflagration in his book: "All around me was mayhem. Planes were burning. More bombs cooked off. Body parts, pieces of the ship, and scraps of planes were dropping onto the deck. Pilots strapped in their seats ejected into the firestorm. Men trapped by flames jumped overboard. More Zuni missiles streaked across the deck. Explosions tore craters in the flight deck, and burning fuel fell through the opening into the hangar bay, spreading the fire below." McCain wrote that he helped dump some bombs over the side of the ship before heading to the ready room and then sick bay to treat his wounds. He acknowledged the crew managed to control the flight deck fire by that afternoon, but below-deck fires lasted for another 24 hours. "The fires were consuming the Forrestal. I thought she might sink," he wrote. "But the crew’s heroics kept her afloat. Men sacrificed their lives for one another and for their ship. Many of them were only 18 or 19 years old." The Forrestal was drydocked and refit, staying in service until being decommissioned in 1993. The fire, considered the worst combat-related naval disaster since World War II, led to changes in crew training and flight deck procedures. McCain transferred to the USS Oriskany, the aircraft carrier from which he took off on Oct. 27, 1967, the day he was shot down over North Vietnam and taken prisoner. Our ruling Bloggers said McCain "was singlehandedly responsible for starting a fire on (the) USS Forrestal aircraft carrier." Though specific details vary, no official or thoroughly researched account of the Forrestal fire blames McCain or any other particular pilot. A rocket from a jet other than McCain’s misfired due to an electrical surge, hitting a plane from across the flight deck and starting the blaze. Several other factors contributed to the conflagration burning out of control and killing 134 sailors and pilots. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05401	Says President Barack Obama "added" $6.5 trillion to the national debt in his first term, more than the $6.3 trillion added by the previous 43 presidents combined.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/04/chain-email/obama-has-added-more-national-debt-previous-43-pre/	When it comes to increasing the national debt, President Barack Obama has done more than his 43 predecessors combined. Well, at least that’s according to a chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey, echoing a claim made to varying degrees by different Republican officials in recent years. With the subject line "A picture is worth 1,000 words," the chain e-mail features a graphic to make its case. Above pictures of Presidents George Washington and George W. Bush, one side of the graphic reads "Debt Added By The Previous 43 U.S. PRESIDENTS COMBINED --- 1789 through 2008." Beneath the presidents’ photos is "$6.3 TRILLION DOLLARS." On the other side of the graphic is a photo of a smiling Obama, beneath the words "Debt Added By PRESIDENT OBAMA --- One Term!" The amount listed below the photo is "$6.5 TRILLION DOLLARS." A picture may be worth 1,000 words, but the wording of this chain e-mail makes for a largely inaccurate claim. The main problem is the chain e-mail suggests that Obama already has "added" $6.5 trillion to the national debt. His administration is on track to add nearly that amount to one form of debt by October 2013, but the president has not added that much debt yet. First, let’s explain the two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt. The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare. On Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, the debt held by the public -- as accrued by Obama’s predecessors -- stood at roughly $6.307 trillion and the total debt was about $10.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator. Since the amount listed for Obama's predecessors in the chain e-mail appears to be in reference to the $6.307 trillion in debt held by the public on Jan. 20, 2009, that's the starting point for our analysis. Next, we'll show how much both forms of debt had increased as of April 27, 2012 -- the last date available at the time we received the chain e-mail. By that date, the debt held by the public was about $10.8 trillion and total debt had climbed to roughly $15.6 trillion. So, under Obama’s watch, debt held by the public had increased by about $4.5 trillion, or roughly 72 percent. Total debt had increased by nearly $5 trillion, or about 47 percent. By either form of debt, the amounts added during Obama’s administration were not greater than the levels on the day he took office. Now, let’s explain one way that this chain e-mail could be considered accurate. If we take into account administration projections for debt held by the public as of the end of fiscal year 2013, then the amount of that debt added would exceed the level from Jan. 20, 2009. Fiscal year 2013 is the last budget year to begin during Obama’s first term. According to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, debt held by the public is estimated to be about $12.636 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2013, which concludes Sept. 30, 2013. Based on that estimate, the amount of debt held by the public that was added during Obama’s tenure would be about $6.329 trillion, surpassing the amount as of his inauguration by about $22 billion. In terms of total debt -- projected to increase to $17.5 trillion -- the amount added by the end of fiscal year 2013 would still not exceed the total amount on Jan. 20, 2009. Before we get to our ruling, it's worth noting that actions taken by both Presidents Bush and Obama have contributed to the debt increases over the last decade. Those factors include tax cuts enacted under Bush and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which were started by the Bush administration, as well as the stimulus bill and another tax cut deal approved by Obama. Experts also have pointed to the weak economy as a contributing factor to the higher debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits. Our ruling A chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey claims that Obama has "added" $6.5 trillion to the national debt, while his 43 predecessors added $6.3 trillion combined. But the chain e-mail is wrong to suggest the additional debt during Obama’s tenure already has exceeded the level of his predecessors. In terms of both debt held by the public and total debt, the Obama administration has added less debt than the amounts in place when he took office. Still, the national debt is projected to keep increasing. The amount of added debt held by the public may exceed Obama’s predecessors by October 2013, according to White House projections.

pomt-09120	"If you read the Arizona (immigration) law, what it says is if you are stopped for violating the law and they have a suspicion that you're illegal, they can ask you if you're legal."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-immigration-arizona-status-illegal/	Arizona's polarizing immigration law has become a divisive issue in the Republican gubernatorial primary, with Rick Scott promising to bring the hard-line legislation to Florida if elected. Scott, a political newcomer from Naples who once oversaw the Columbia/HCA hospital chain, released a television ad last month that heralded his hard-line stance on illegal immigration and scolded his rival, Attorney General Bill McCollum, for his opposition to bringing a similar law to Florida. Critics of the law -- which was signed in its final version by Arizona's Republican governor, Jan Brewer, on April 30, 2010 -- bristled over Scott's portrayal of what he called a "common-sense" law enforcement approach. The law makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires law enforcement officials to investigate the immigration status of suspicious persons or risk being sued. In a recent television interview with a South Florida CBS affiliate, Scott defended his position that the legislation doesn't allow law enforcement officers to stop immigrants based on skin color. "No one believes in racial profiling. I clearly don't believe in racial profiling," Scott said. "But the Arizona law permits it," interjected CBS4 reporter Gary Nelson "Absolutely not," Scott countered. "It says you cannot do that. If you read the Arizona law, what it says is if you are stopped for violating the law and they have a suspicion that you're illegal, they can ask you if you're legal. That's what it says." PolitiFact has already taken a look at the racial profiling aspect of the law. For this item, we'll analyze whether Scott's summary of the law is accurate and complete. The key part of the law reads, "For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county, city or town in this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation." We began by looking at whether the wording of the law -- "for any lawful stop, detention or arrest" -- is equivalent to Scott's formulation, "stopped for violating the law." Not exactly, say the legal experts we consulted, such as Michael M. Hethmon, director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, which helped write the Arizona law. Arizona's law allows people to be questioned if they are lawfully stopped or questioned for any reason, whether it's a traffic stop, or a municipal violation like letting your grass grow too tall in a community that requires frequent mowing. And suspects only need be involved in a possible or potential violation, Hethmon said. Karl Manheim, a law professor at Loyola Law School, agreed, saying that Scott's statement doesn't accurately convey the authority law enforcement officers have under the law. "If you are lawfully stopped for any reason, they can demand immigration status," he said. He said he doesn't consider Scott's formulation to be false, but rather "incomplete." There's a second discrepancy between the law and Scott's explanation. Scott said law enforcement officials "can ask you if you're legal" -- but the law uses the word, "shall," which means it isn't really an option, according to our experts. The law states that a person can prove their immigration status by flashing valid identification, such as an Arizona driver license or identification card. It continues, "Any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released." "It is not that 'they can ask,'" said Jack Chin, a law professor at the University of Arizona. "It is that they 'shall' make an investigation if practicable when there is reasonable suspicion. It is a requirement, not an authorization." Scott is not alone -- many political leaders have stumbled over the often-convoluted layers of the Arizona immigration law. And with judicial challenges already underway, it's too soon to say for sure how the law will be carried out in practice. Ultimately, Scott's statement falls short on two counts -- on failing to communicate the full range of violations that could trigger a police stop, and on suggesting that the law gives wider discretion to officers on when it should be enforced. So we find Scott's statement Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2010-06-17T13:36:53	2010-06-03	['Arizona']
pomt-05490	In labor negotiations with city employees, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett "demanded concessions that went beyond those mandated" by Gov. Scott Walker’s collective bargaining law	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/18/afscme/afscme-says-milwaukee-mayor-tom-barrett-demanded-u/	We know why labor unions stand against Republican Gov. Scott Walker and in favor of recalling him: the 2011 changes that nearly eliminated collective bargaining rights for most public employees. But why are they so mad at Democrat Tom Barrett, who opposed those limits? The Milwaukee mayor is one of four Democratic candidates vying to face Walker in the June 5, 2012 election. The primary is May 8. AFSCME Wisconsin, which represents thousands of government workers in Milwaukee and Wisconsin, says it’s because Tom Barrett out-did Walker in putting the hammer down on unions. Specifically, the Milwaukee arm of AFSCME claims Barrett publicly was ripping the union limits while quietly using the prospect of the law to try to get unusually deep concessions to balance the city budget. The group embedded its charge in an April 7, 2012 apology of sorts for highlighting a scathing Internet video that claimed Barrett supported Walker’s limits on bargaining. We rated that claim False. The AFSCME statement on the video mostly served to reiterate labor concerns over Barrett’s relationship with labor, and underscore its support for Barrett rival Kathleen Falk. "Unfortunately, Tom Barrett's record is very different (than Falk’s)," the statement said. "When our members who work for the city of Milwaukee tried to negotiate with him as Walker was ramming through Act 10, Barrett wasn't interested in working with us." Then came the union’s final punch: "Instead, he demanded concessions that went far beyond those mandated by Act 10." Act 10 prohibits government employers from bargaining with unions over benefit levels, working conditions and wage increases over the rate of inflation. It takes effect as existing union contracts expire, allowing communities to unilaterally collect more from workers for health insurance, pensions and more. For unions without an active contract, it took effect right away. Did Barrett really oppose the bargaining changes and then use them to cut even deeper into union power? That question gets to the heart of why many unions, some of which sat out the 2010 election in which Walker defeated Barrett, are opposed to the Milwaukee mayor. The answer to the first part is relatively straightforward. The mayor clearly spoke against such extensive limits on bargaining, we reported earlier, though he also strongly backed Walker’s move to get public employees to pay more for their benefits. The second question turns on what exactly Act 10 "mandated." How you view it partly depends on which side of the bargaining table you sit on. Let’s rewind the clock. The sweeping law passed in March 2011 amid chaos at the Capitol but did not go into effect until June 2011 because of court challenges. Many unions, including AFSCME, sought to extend contracts before Act 10 took effect -- opening talks in Milwaukee, for example, even before the measure came to a vote. And AFSCME, again like many other unions, was willing to accept health and pension concessions in order to get a contract that still offered a host of protections -- and pushed off the day when they would be subject to the full force of Act 10. But the negotiations in Milwaukee collapsed, leaving Barrett free -- after AFSCME’s contract expired on Dec. 31, 2011 -- to put as much of Act 10 into effect as he wanted. More on that later. To learn how the union backs up its claim that Barrett "demanded concessions that went far beyond those mandated by Act 10," we turned to Richard Abelson, the veteran head of AFSCME District Council 48, which represents many city employees. Abelson sent us the opening proposal from the city of Milwaukee negotiators to the union on Feb. 24, 2011. The city’s offer included proposals to get a 4.9 percent wage cut (essentially equal to the pension contribution Walker’s bill envisioned), and increase workers’ share of health insurance premiums to 12 percent. Abelson acknowledged those were right out of the Act 10 playbook. But he contended that Barrett’s proposal to eliminate contractual work rules spelling out overtime provisions, hours of work and duty disability pay went "far beyond" the mandates of Act 10. He also said the city’s side rejected a union proposal for raises of 50 percent and 75 percent of the inflation rate in 2013 and 2014. "Even Walker’s bill allowed that," Abelson said. Let’s take a closer look. Act 10 did mandate higher pension contributions from workers at the City of Milwaukee, other municipalities and school districts, and in state government. And it mandated that 12 percent health-care share for state employees and some local employees, though Milwaukee was not included because it’s not part of the state health plan. At the bargaining table, Barrett went beyond those two specific fiscal concessions. But so did Act 10. The measure mandated an end to collective bargaining on health care, pensions, overtime and other work rules. In other words, it allowed employers such as the City of Milwaukee to turn all those items into management rights. So the city could unilaterally decide to trim payments and benefits that once were agreed to in negotiated contracts. The greater control over overtime and work rules sought by Barrett’s team was exactly what Act 10 envisioned -- Walker said it would help local governments and school districts offset state aid cuts. But let’s return to the statement, that Barrett "demanded concessions that went beyond those mandated." First, Barrett didn’t "demand" concessions. The city’s proposal was just that, a proposal. It was the starting point in the inevitable give-and-take of negotiations. To be sure, the city offer was a jolt: No pay raise, new salary deductions for pension and health care, and elimination of overtime and workweek protections that had been part of the contracts for decades. The city wanted a one-year extension; the union wanted two or three years. Barrett aides say the city saw a massive pension payment coming in 2013, and did not want to get locked into a pay raise while trying to absorb major state aid cuts that Walker’s budget delivered. Two longtime observers of labor negotiations told us the AFSCME claim is only accurate in a technical sense. "It is true that Act 10 did not ‘mandate’ changes in work rules," noted Dan Thompson, executive director, League of Wisconsin Municipalities. "But it allowed (Barrett) to change them" without bargaining. "It’s worse in a way," from labor’s standpoint, Thompson said. Bottom line: Barrett could have gone even further if he was using Act 10 as a model. In the spirit of Act 10, he could have refused to bargain on all topics except base wages, and ignored all past labor contract language on work rules. "In some very narrow sense, the union is right, but the statement ignores the big picture" of Act 10’s effect, said Peter Davis, Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission general counsel. Barrett also points out that his team left many of the AFSCME contract’s points in place -- on sick leave for rank-and-file workers, health insurance at retirement, vacations and other issues -- and the union was willing to agree to several of Barrett’s changes if a raise accompanied them. There’s an interesting coda to all this. In the end, AFSCME’s old contract expired Dec. 31, 2011 with no extension, leaving the city free to have its way on dozens of workplace issues formerly subject to bargaining. Barrett used what Walker calls the "tools" to get major health care savings for his budget. (He never got the increased pension contribution after a city attorney legal opinion cast doubt on its legality.) But Barrett and the Common Council dug even deeper, eliminating a host of bargained provisions of years past. Here’s the list and estimated savings for 2012 totalling almost $1 million: New limits on overtime ($195,000); changes to duty disability payments ($140,000); less make-up pay for days lost to inclement weather ($125,975); lower auto mileage reimbursement ($41,139); and smaller sick leave payouts for management ($120,000). The city went further on other benefits, eliminating these: clothing and cleaning allowances ($187,114), paid lunches ($84,844), glove and tool allowances ($54,020), educational bonuses ($22,404) and additional money paid to employees released to conduct union business ($14,509). The city also cut annual sick leave earnings from 15 to 12 days, reduced call-in pay from three hours to two, but said the savings were unpredictable. Some things got better: Shift differential pay increased in some cases, and funeral leave expanded for some. Our conclusion AFSCME said that in labor negotiations, Barrett "demanded concessions that went beyond those mandated" by Walker’s bill severely curtailing collective bargaining. Barrett didn’t "demand" concessions. There’s a kernel of truth in that Act 10 didn’t mandate fiscal concessions beyond pension and health insurance, but in reality it dictated that employers could make many of the kinds of changes Barrett proposed in the AFSCME talks. We rate the union’s claim Mostly False. (You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's main website by clicking here.)

Jan Brewer rejected President Barack Obama’s claim that the White House had talked to police officers opposed to Arizona’s controversial immigration law. She shook her head no and said, “Law enforcement in the state of Arizona supports Senate bill 1070,” referring to the new law that directs police to question individuals if they reasonably suspect they are in the U.S. illegally. Later in the interview, she said, “We have many organizations and groups of the officers on the ground that understand the problem, need another tool in order to address the problem and support it wholeheartedly. And everybody that I come across in law enforcement, other than a couple of sheriffs in a couple of areas--other than that, you know, the majority of law enforcement support the bill! So that’s just a misrepresentation again on behalf of the federal government!” She summed it up later by saying of Obama’s comments, “the bottom line is that he’s wrong” about law enforcement opposition to the bill. Listening to the governor, you get the distinct impression that law enforcement opposition to the bill is either non-existent or negligible. But, is that accurate? Brewer's office sent us a document listing those who favored and opposed the law, which the Obama administration is now challenging in federal court. Supporters include groups representing police officers, such as the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, and the Arizona Police Association, which describes itself as “an association of associations, not an association of individual members.” Nonetheless, its website says that it “represents nearly 9,000 federal, state and local law officers in the state of Arizona.” The governor’s office notes that the two are the state’s largest law enforcement groups. The same document noted, however, that the 140-member Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police had spoken in opposition to the measure. The document also noted that Gregg Stanton, Arizona’s deputy attorney general for legislation, policy, and strategic planning, had also opposed the law. Attorney General Terry Goddard, the state’s top law enforcement official, is running for the Democratic nomination for governor and will likely face Brewer as an opponent. His office has opposed the law. When the Obama administration filed suit July 6 to block the law from taking effect, it filed supporting declarations from the chiefs of police in Arizona’s two largest cities, Phoenix and Tucson, and from the sheriff of Santa Cruz County, which includes Nogales, Arizona’s largest town on the Mexico border. All three opposed the measure. So, was Brewer right to claim law enforcement support for the measure? She has numbers on her side, because there are more rank and file officers than there are chiefs of police. But to minimize the opposition as “a couple of sheriffs in a couple of areas,” doesn’t convey the split in law enforcement when it comes to the law. The police chiefs who filed declarations supporting the Obama administration’s attempt to block it stressed their own concerns about illegal immigration. But when it came to the new law, they expressed worry that it will stop undocumented witnesses from coming forth in serious crimes, impose large new amounts of work on police forces without additional compensation, invite lawsuits against police departments and divert police from focusing on crimes such as kidnappings and illegal drug smuggling. Brewer suggests unified support from police. Yes, there is support from two police groups, but there’s also opposition from police chiefs. We find her claim Half True.

pomt-02245	Seventy-two percent of Georgians did not have a chance to finish college.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/14/karen-handel/handels-degree-claim-nearly-makes-grade/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate Karen Handel and her supporters have turned GOP rival David Perdue’s remarks about her not graduating from college into a campaign issue she hopes will bring Georgia voters to her side when it’s time to vote on May 20. "Let's remind David that a lot more defines a person than whether they have a college degree," former Georgia Republican Party Chair Sue Everhart was quoted in a Handel campaign email. There was another line in the email from Everhart that we wanted to fact-check. "David’s either an elitist or just arrogant. But either way, he thinks he’s better than 72 percent of Georgians who did not have the chance to finish college," it read. We wondered if that statistic is correct. In this age of parents constantly impressing upon children the importance of a college education, surely more than a scant 28 percent of Georgians finished college. Our research surprised us, but we found Handel’s claim omitted a point. Handel left what she has described as a dysfunctional home when she was 17. Handel finished high school and took some college courses, but never earned a degree. Handel has been chair of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and was elected Georgia secretary of state. Handel lost the GOP runoff for governor in 2010 to the current occupant of the Governor’s Mansion, Nathan Deal. Handel, who’s been out of politics since then, has struggled to get attention in the crowded GOP U.S. Senate field that includes three congressmen and the deep-pocketed David Perdue, cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue. That was until a video of David Perdue’s comments about why he’s the best fit for the Senate surfaced. "There's a high school graduate in this race, OK? I'm sorry, but these issues are so much broader, so complex," Perdue, a former CEO of several major businesses who has bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Georgia Tech, said in the video. Republicans from 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin to former White House press secretary Dana Perino criticized Perdue’s comments. Palin recently made a campaign stop in Georgia and endorsed Handel. "There are a lot of good, hard-working Americans who have more common sense in their pinkie finger than a lot of those Ivy League pieces of paper up on a wall that represent some elitism," Palin said. "Not all of the time does a college degree matter." Perdue called Handel to apologize, but her campaign said the apology was owed "to the many other Georgians he demeaned." The Handel campaign is hoping Perdue’s comments will propel the campaign’s prospects with what seems to be a large bloc of voters who’ve been in her shoes. So, back to our initial query. We started our research by calling Everhart. She said the numbers came from the Handel campaign, and Everhart trusted the campaign did its homework. "It did seem high to me," Everhart said of the 72 percent claim. "But there are a lot of people who go to college, but they don’t complete the four years." Handel campaign manager Corry Bliss said the claim came from Census Bureau data. The federal agency’s statistics show 27.8 percent of Georgians older than 25 have a bachelor’s degree or higher. The national average is slightly higher, at 28.5 percent. Other data supports Handel’s claim. The most recent numbers from the National Center for Educational Statistics show 27.4 percent of Georgians older than 25 have a bachelor’s degree or higher. The national average, according to the chart we reviewed, was 28 percent. These numbers, however, do not include two-year degrees. One U.S. Department of Education chart shows 35.5 percent of Georgians had an associate, bachelor’s degree or higher in 2010. One organization, the Lumina Foundation, cited a 2011 U.S. Census Bureau report that shows 36.4 percent of Georgians have an associate degree or better. The Lumina Foundation, based in Indianapolis, also breaks down the statistics by each Georgia county. Fulton County edged out Fayette County with the highest percentage of graduates, 55.55, according to the numbers. The foundation’s goal is to increase the number of Americans with college degrees to 60 percent by 2025. President Barack Obama has set a more ambitious goal of getting to that mark by the end of the decade. The Education Department says the United States has fallen from first to 16th in the world in the percentage of adults with a college degree. Courtney Brown, the foundation’s director of organizational performance and evaluation, said the U.S. has lagged because it did not put a higher emphasis on higher education. She said the country needs more creative approaches, such as offering credits for learning outside the classroom. Brown said the percentage of Georgians getting a college degree has increased in recent years due to efforts to close the achievement gap between whites and non-white students and legislation such as a bill passed during the recently-completed session to pay full tuition for the state's highest achieving technical college students. To sum up, the Handel campaign gave Everhart information to claim 72 percent of Georgians do not have a college degree. The claim is correct if you solely consider Georgia’s bachelor’s degrees or higher. The percentage of Georgians without degrees is slightly lower once you include those who earned associate degrees. Once you do that, it’s more like 65 percent. There’s a little context missing in the Handel campaign’s claim, but it’s mostly on the mark. Our rating: Mostly True.

pomt-10134	Under Barack Obama's health care proposal, "if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/barack-obama/obamas-plan-expands-existing-system/	Barack Obama defended his health care plan during a debate in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 7, 2008. His opponents have attacked his plan as "government-run" health care. "No. 1, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it," Obama said. "All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. You'll still have choice of doctor." Obama is accurately describing his health care plan here. He advocates a program that seeks to build on the current system, rather than dismantling it and starting over. Obama's plan essentially takes today's system and seeks to expand it to the uninsured. It creates national pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. And it has several strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventive care. Obama has said he would like his plan to be universal, in that everyone has health care coverage. But currently it includes a mandate only for children. Obama has said that he did not include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes. It remains to be seen whether Obama's plan will actually be able to achieve the cost savings it promises for the health care system. But people who want to keep their current insurance should be able to do that under Obama's plan. His description of his plan is accurate, and we rate his statement True.

pomt-05218	Says Barack Obama is a socialist.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/jun/08/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-obama-socialist/	U.S. House hopeful Roger Williams, the former Texas secretary of state, considers President Barack Obama anti-business and worse. According to a June 6, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, Williams said at an appearance before the Republican Club of Austin: "We need business people more than ever to go to Washington and make these business decisions instead of these political decisions. We need somebody to fight for small businesses." Williams also vowed to "fight a president who's, quite frankly, a socialist," the story says. Is Obama, who won election as a Democrat, a socialist? This was not the first time Williams, who faces retired Army Lt. Col. Wes Riddle in a July runoff for the Congressional District 25 Republican nomination, has laid stake to the claim. His campaign website features a June 11, 2011, video of Williams speaking to the Rockwall County Republican Men’s Club and saying of Obama: "Quit trying to figure him out. Quit trying to decide if he’s smart enough for this job or whatever. The guy is smart. He’s a socialist, OK?" The video was made by The Rockwall News. By email, Williams’ campaign manager, Colby Hale, pointed to a dictionary definition of socialism as "any of various social systems based on shared or government ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of good." His email offers as indications of Obama being a socialist his call while running for president for universal health care to be funded by employers and tax increases for wealthy Americans and his signing into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which is sometimes called Obamacare. Hale said that law doesn’t achieve universal coverage but, he said, it contains elements qualifying it as socialism including regulations and measures to "redistribute earnings from certain sets of people in order to give an un-earned benefit to others." Asked what this references, Hale singled out projected cost reductions, tax increases and penalties for not obtaining health coverage associated with the law. In January 2012, PolitiFact found the health care law a poor example of socialism while reviewing Gov. Rick Perry’s reference to Obama as a socialist. Why? The health care law relies largely on the free-enterprise system. To increase health care coverage for the uninsured and people in small business, the law sets up exchanges to encourage private health insurance companies to compete. On the day Williams spoke in Austin, the Associated Press posted a news article on the socialist charge about Obama quoting Greg Pason, national secretary of the Socialist Party USA, saying that Obama's health care overhaul "is anything but socialist. It's bailing out for-profit companies." More broadly, Billy Wharton, co-chair of the Socialist Party USA, wrote a commentary published in the Washington Post on March 15, 2009 suggesting that not only is Obama no socialist, he may "not even be a liberal. Socialists understand him more as a hedge-fund Democrat -- one of a generation of neoliberal politicians firmly committed to free-market policies," Wharton wrote. Hale’s email also singles out Obama’s plans, declared as a presidential candidate, to tax and penalize "energy producers and energy users in order to finance some set of goals, subsidies, and programs." The email labels this "cap and tax," meaning it refers to Obama’s promise as a candidate to forge a "cap and trade" approach to reducing climate-warming carbon emissions. The idea is that the government sets a limit (the cap) on how much carbon different companies can emit. The government then issues permits to companies -- typically electric utilities and manufacturers -- and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed (the trade). If the policy works as intended, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively. Republicans attacked the plan as a job-killing energy tax. And in November 2010, Obama’s promise was rated Broken on the PolitiFact Obamater after Obama acknowledged its prospects of clearing Congress had diminished. Williams is hardly the first Republican to call Obama a socialist. PolitiFact ultimately rated Perry’s description of Obama as a socialist Pants on Fire after earlier founding no basis for such assessments by others, rating Pants on Fire a 2008 claim by Sarah Palin based on Obama's conversation with Joe the Plumber (as Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher came to be known after that conversation) that Obama's tax policy was socialism. In 2010, PolitiFact Oregon and other PolitiFact state sites checked a claim by bloggers that 70 House Democrats are socialists (Pants on Fire). In September 2011, we found such a charge about two Texas Democrats similarly flammable; see that review here. Let’s recap PolitiFact’s January 2012 check on whether other Obama initiatives signal a socialist lean. Obama’s tax policy tracks with the progressive approach that has been the cornerstone of American tax policy since the federal government first collected an income tax in 1863, an approach embraced by Republicans and Democrats. It was based on the Tax Act of 1862, which President Abraham Lincoln signed, and which imposed a "duty of three per centum" on all income over $600, and five percent on income over $10,000. The idea is that the wealthy pay a larger share of their income because they are more able to afford it. To the extent the government then gives some of the money to the less-wealthy through various programs, you could say the income is being redistributed. But that concept has been embraced by Republicans and Democrats for well over a century. That's a far cry from true socialism. What of Obama’s economic stimulus, also criticized by Republicans, or his support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)? In February 2009, Obama and the Democrats muscled through a $787 billion spending package to try to jump-start the economy. The program was about one-third tax cuts and two-thirds government spending on everything from clean energy initiatives to electronic speed-limit signs. It's true that government payrolls were stabilized or grew because of the infusion, but it was nowhere near a government takeover of our private enterprise economy. Obama inherited the TARP, which was the Bush administration's plan for stabilizing the economy. It was designed to prevent financial firms from collapsing by buying assets and stakes in the companies. In December 2008, President George W. Bush authorized use of the money for loans to U.S. automakers. Obama has emphasized he was not eager for the U.S. government to be involved in such efforts, but he considered them necessary. "If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout," he said in his 2010 State of the Union Address, adding that "if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost. So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks." Many Republicans opposed the TARP -- an initiative of a Republican administration -- as too much government intrusion into the private enterprise system. This is an area where one could begin to make a case that the government was taking ownership, but as a percentage of the full U.S. economy, it was relatively small and temporary. Experts agree that either taken alone or piled up together, Obama’s initiatives fail to demonstrate that he is bent on socialism. "Socialism means public ownership of the means of production. Obama does not believe this. Therefore he is not a socialist," conservative economist Bruce Bartlett told PolitiFact in an e-mail. "Although it is true that the federal government did come to own some private businesses as a consequence of bailout policies initiated by the George W. Bush administration such as TARP, the Obama administration sold many of them -- such as its shares in GM -- as quickly as feasible. A true socialist would have held on to them." Dan Mitchell, a scholar on fiscal policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, says there are other words for Obama's expansion of government (he thinks "fascism" is a fair term or perhaps statist), but that it's not accurate to call it socialism. Daniel N. Shaviro, professor of taxation at New York University Law School, said "it is a lie" to say Obama is a socialist. "If he is a socialist, so were Eisenhower and Bush Sr." Our ruling Republicans and Democrats frequently diverge over tax policy, economics and the role of government. Certain Obama policies may have expanded government. Some perceive the health care law as government asserting more control over health care. But we don't see how that's fodder for Obama being a socialist. Indeed, not only is there no case for Obama being a socialist, it's a preposterous sally. We're snatching the matches -- Pants on Fire!

pomt-09252	For the new state budget, "Floridians have sent us $3 billion less of their funding."	false	/florida/statements/2010/may/05/anitere-flores/anitere-flores-says-floridians-have-sent-3-billion/	As they prepared to send next year's $70.4 billion budget to Gov. Charlie Crist, Republican lawmakers said their plan protects important priorities such as education while the state is still emerging from the recession. In a floor speech on the last day of the 2010 legislative session, state Rep. Anitere Flores, the chief education budget writer in the House, noted that per-pupil spending slightly increased this year – despite the tough times. "The facts are very clear," said Flores, a Republican from Miami. "We all knew going into this year that we were going to have to cut over $3 billion. "At a time when Floridians had less … At a time when Floridians have sent us $3 billion less of their funding, to be able to say that we kept our promise to you guys – funding education – I think it’s something we should be proud of.” We were curious if she was right about Floridians sending $3 billion less. We contacted her office for clarification but she did not return our calls. Her underlying point -- that lawmakers had a difficult budget year -- was correct. As lawmakers cobbled together the 2010-11 budget, the deficit -- the difference between state revenues and the money needed to pay for key services -- was $3.2 billion. (If you only include what lawmakers termed the "critical needs," the deficit shrunk to $1.1 billion.) But the reason for the budget squeeze wasn't because Floridians were sending $3 billion less in tax money. The amount of general revenue actually went up from $21 billion in last year’s budget to $22.9 billion for the new budget -- an 8 percent increase. That's largely because last year lawmakers balanced the budget by hiking taxes and fees to the tune of $2.2 billion. So contrary to what Flores said, Floridians sent more money to Tallahassee, not less. In fact, the reason for this year's budget crunch was that expenses -- particularly mandatory ones such as Medicaid -- went up substantially. The largest built-in cost increase is for Florida's Medicaid system, which serves the poor and disabled. To qualify for federal stimulus money, the state had to keep services at roughly the same level. As the ranks of the poor swelled during the recession, more people were added to Medicaid. Spending on that program jumped $1.8 billion this year, for a total of more than $19 billion. We should note that the budgets were propped up with stimulus cash from the federal government: $5 billion last year and $2.4 billion this year. But we don't think that's what Flores was referring to when she mentioned the $3 billion reduction. So to recap, looking at the overall budget, it's clear spending has increased. Last year, lawmakers passed a $66.5 billion budget. This year, the spending plan totaled $70.4 billion – almost $4 billion more. Bottom line: the state can still have a deficit while bringing in more funding, which is just the case this year. Flores misspoke when she said Floridians have sent the government less money. They've done just the opposite. Her statement earns a False. UPDATE: Flores e-mailed PolitiFact after this item was published and said she inartfully worded her statement and meant to refer to the budget shortfall, not the amount of revenue the state brought in.

pomt-08030	"There hasn't really been a lot of net growth in the federal workforce when you compare it to say, 1990."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/06/gerry-connolly/rep-gerry-connolly-says-federal-workforce-hasnt-gr/	Mention the federal government and people inevitably say it’s too big. Rep. Gerry E. Connolly, D-Va., disagrees. Connolly defends federal government employees. He represents almost 60,000 of them in Northern Virginia’s 11th Congressional District. Talking with The Washington Post just before Christmas, Connolly addressed what he views as a growing anti-public sector sentiment in America. "I think the Congress we elected in November is a lot less hospitable to the interests of federal employees," he said. "I think you're going to see a lot more legislative action and suggestion aimed at reducing the size and compensation of that federal workforce and retirees." Connolly said the notion that federal government is over sized is misplaced. "Facts be damned: There's a lot of rhetoric on the other side about the growth of the federal workforce, but it's about the size it was under the first President Bush," he said. "There hasn't really been a lot of net growth in the federal workforce when you compare it to say, 1990. It's not like it's gotten out of hand, it's true." Is it really? There are two answers. On one hand, Connolly is understating his case. On the other, he’s ignoring the true size of government. According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, in 1990 total government employment -- including all branches and uniformed military personnel -- was 5.23 million. By 2009, that number dropped to 4.43 million. If we exclude military personnel, the number fell from 3.128 million in 1990 to 2.84 million in 2009. After years of decline, those workforce numbers did begin to rise in 2008. To get a more current read, we turned to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has preliminary figures as recent as November 2010. According to BLS data, total federal government employment was 3.103 million in January 1990. Preliminary numbers for November 2010 are 2.837 million. Even if you don’t count postal service workers, the story holds true. In January 1990, the figure was 2.273 million excluding those employees and in November 2010 it was down to 2.195 million. "The reality is that the federal workforce got much smaller between 1989 and 2009, almost entirely driven by deep cuts following the end of the Cold War, " said Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York University. "The Defense Department workforce fell from about 1 million civilian employees in 1990 to roughly 650,000 by 2004 and has inched up by 100,000 or so since. That was a big "peace dividend" that allowed Bill Clinton to claim that the era of big government was over." But there’s a catch, and it’s huge. While official workforce figures have gone down in recent decades, use of government contractors has exploded, especially in the defense sector following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In fiscal 2000, the government spent $208 billion on contractors. In fiscal 2009, that figure was up more than 150 percent, to $540 billion. What does that mean for the workforce? Well, if you consider government contractors federal employees and view grantees -- like universities -- as employing people on behalf of the federal government ("Nuclear labs are run by universities, but are clearly federal agencies," said Light), the numbers have rocketed. "I think the true size of government is going up -- often for good reasons such as the need to reduce backlogs in key service agencies...and increase the number of inspectors needed to execute the rules on deepwater drilling, workplace discrimination, etc.," Light said. The problem, Light says, is that the total government workforce number including contractors is elusive and difficult to calculate. He said the the only way to get a proper sense of it is to take existing data on every government contract transaction and run it through a model used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Light did that in 2006 and found that the "true size" of the federal government workforce was 14.6 million employees including civil servants, postal workers, military personnel, contractors, and grantees. More than half of that total was contractors. In 1990, Light says the true size of the federal government was 12.6 million, meaning that by his definition, the federal workforce had increased 2 million by 2006. "BLS and OPM are fixated, as is the Republican Congress, on the number of federal employees, and have no way to count the hidden workforce," Light said. "Unfortunately, no one really wants to know the answer. It's a big, big number that would inflame public anger and is generally avoided by both parties." So let’s look back. Connolly says the the size of the federal government's workforce has not grown much since 1990, when George H.W. Bush was President. Based on the official numbers he sources, he’s safe. But there are two definitions of "federal workforce": 1) Public servants working directly for the government and earning benefits, or 2) Light’s version: "everyone who gets their paycheck directly from Uncle Sam or through contracts and other purchasing vehicles."

pomt-02445	Gun "marketplaces" on Facebook mean "ANYONE can broker a deal on a gun online, meet the seller in a parking lot somewhere, and walk away with a weapon."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2014/feb/27/moms-demand-action-gun-sense-america/can-anyone-broker-gun-deal-facebook-and-walk-away-/	In the wake of the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, gun-control advocates have redoubled efforts to pass laws focusing on universal background checks, clip capacity and assault rifles. Gun-rights groups have fought back, arguing that background checks won’t stop felons from getting weapons and that Second Amendment protections trump the need for new regulations. The Claim A national group with an Oregon chapter, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, has launched a campaign aimed at persuading Facebook to ban online gun "marketplaces." Gun sales through these marketplaces are carried out legally without background checks, according to the group. And the downside is already apparent, they said, pointing to a convicted felon who was arrested in Iowa last week for acquiring a gun using a Facebook post. They added this: "This means that ANYONE can broker a deal on a gun online, meet the seller in a parking lot somewhere, and walk away with a weapon." Anyone? In a parking lot? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The Analysis We followed links to the 16 Oregon Facebook gun marketplaces listed in the group’s news release. The pages all have different administrators but share some features. They allow those who have joined that group to advertise guns, rifles, ammunition and gun parts. People can also include posts seeking to buy. Telephone numbers are often provided, and actual transactions are handled privately. We called Dennis Cannon, a Prineville resident who is an administrator of a central Oregon Facebook gun page, and asked whether background checks are part of typical sales. "It’s up to each individual to do a background check on the person they are selling to," Cannon said. "You can do that free through the sheriff’s office and run whoever you want." Asked whether the sites are appropriate, he said, "We have the right to bear arms. Felons don’t. I see nothing wrong with the sites. That’s why we live in a free country." Next we called Kevin Starrett, executive director of the pro-gun Oregon Firearms Federation. He hadn’t heard of the Facebook sites but didn’t see anything surprising. "At my gun club, people put up notes with pictures when they want to sell a gun," he said. "This is no different than it’s ever been." He acknowledged that the explosion of social media sites such as Facebook makes it possible for many more people to gain access to gun-sale information, but added, "As far as any transactions are concerned, all of the same rules still apply." So can anyone go to one of the Facebook marketplaces, cut a deal and buy a gun? We wanted to know what legal gun transactions -- whether initiated on Facebook or anywhere else -- require. We called Patricia Whitfield, Oregon State Police criminal justice systems director. She pointed us to ORS 166.436, which addresses firearm transfers by people other than gun dealers. Private-party sales, it states, do not require background checks. Not seeking a check, however, could cause a seller to run afoul of a companion statute, ORS 166.470, which applies to a seller who "knows or reasonably should know" that the recipient is a minor, has been convicted of a felony or "has any outstanding felony warrants for arrest." So laws pertaining to gun sales originating on Facebook pages are the same as those that apply to any private sale. (Oregon Sen. Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, hopes to get a bill requiring background checks for private-party guns sales through this session of the Legislature. The bill is still alive, though with the session ebbing, chances of it passing this time around don’t look promising.) A Facebook representative who would not give his name passed along links addressing company policies on guns. Advertising that "promotes the sale or use of weapons" won’t be accepted, according to the policies, but the marketplace pages themselves haven’t been deemed improper. He confirmed that Facebook is "in conversations" with Moms Demand Action, but declined to say what, if any, effect the group’s pressure might have. Sarah Finger McDonald, leader of the Oregon chapter of Moms Demand Action, defended her group’s petition drive to change Facebook’s policy. "These sites completely open the door to countless unregulated gun sales," she said. The Ruling Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America has launched a campaign aimed at persuading Facebook to prohibit online gun "marketplaces." The group, providing a link to a news account, said at least one felon has obtained a weapon through a Facebook post. The group asserts that such sites enable "ANYONE" to "broker a deal on a gun online, meet the seller in a parking lot somewhere, and walk away with a weapon." Transactions initiated on Facebook are no different from any other private-party gun sale in Oregon. While current laws don’t require background checks for private sales, it is still the legal responsibility of sellers not to peddle guns to felons and minors. Yet with at least 16 Facebook gun marketplaces now operating in Oregon, far more people than ever have access to an array of guns and rifles. And with the exception of felons and minors, "anyone" can seek out a Facebook gun page, broker a deal online and arrange a private transfer. The group’s statement is true but needs clarification to make clear that the same rules -- or lack thereof -- apply to Facebook transactions as to all other private-party gun sales. Though Facebook pages can advertise guns for sale to a broader audience, there’s nothing inherent about them that makes the actual purchase easier or harder. "ANYONE" is also sweeping. Clearly, Oregon laws -- though they’re sometimes violated -- set some limits on who can buy a gun. We rate the claim Mostly True. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this ruling.

pomt-07817	The White House budget plan will bring domestic discretionary spending to its lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/16/barack-obama/obama-says-domestic-spending-headed-lowest-level-e/	Correction: This item was updated to reflect that it was fiscal year 1961 when non-security discretionary spending, as a percentage of GDP, was 2.2 percent. That was Eisenhower's last budget. Pressing the case for his proposed 2012 budget, President Barack Obama has repeatedly touted the claim that it would cut deeply into the deficit and bring annual domestic spending to its lowest share of the economy since President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Here's how Obama worded it in a speech he made unveiling the budget plan in Baltimore on Feb. 14, 2011. "I’ve called for a freeze on annual domestic spending over the next five years," Obama said. "This freeze would cut the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, bringing this kind of spending -- domestic discretionary spending -- to its lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president. Let me repeat that. Because of our budget, this share of spending will be at its lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower was president. That level of spending is lower than it was under the last three administrations, and it will be lower than it was under Ronald Reagan." The rhetoric flying back and forth about Obama's budget from Democrats and Republicans can be dizzying. There are so many ways to present budget figures. But with Republicans attacking Obama's budget as another spending bonanza, we thought it would be helpful to dig deeper into the president's claim about cutting domestic spending to Eisenhower levels. First, some definitions, because he is not talking about all spending. In fact, he's not talking about the biggest budget drivers, defense and entitlement spending such as Social Security and Medicare. Obama has used the phrase "domestic spending" or "domestic discretionary spending" when citing the statistic. But you won't find either term in the actual budget from the White House Office of Management and Budget. A spokeswoman in the Office of Management and Budget said Obama was talking about non-security discretionary spending. Furthermore, when Obama said it will "bring" domestic spending, as a percentage of GDP, to Eisenhower levels, he didn't mean next year, he meant by 2015. So there's some fine print required to understand the president's shorthand. Let's look at the numbers based on the parameters outlined by the White House. According to an OMB chart on the proposed budget by category as a percentage of GDP (Table S-5), non-security discretionary spending would go from 3.4 percent in 2011 to 2.9 percent in 2012, and down to 2.1 percent in 2015 (see Table S-5, here). So how does that stack up historically? According to a graphic provided by the White House, the 2.1 percent in 2015 would be the lowest level since FY 1961 under Eisenhower, when the level was 2.2 percent. At PolitiFact, we like to see original source documents. So we asked for a link to the historical data that informed their graphic. That doesn't exist. It is possible to reconstruct a table using data from publicly available information -- see the "outlays" section of this budget data. But believe us, it isn't easy. However, the government does keep historical records on non-defense discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP. And the projection for 2015 using that measure would be lower than any level since Eisenhower. Non-defense and non-security spending are related, but they're not the same thing. As the name suggests, non-defense includes everything but defense. Non-security, however, includes everything except defense, homeland security, State/International, veterans affairs, and the part of the Department of Energy that deals with nuclear security. Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a middle-of-the-road budget-hawk group, said Obama's numbers -- while difficult to put into historical context in the form Obama used -- are "completely plausible." "My instinct, given everything else we know, is that they are correct," Goldwein said. The budget analysts at the conservative Heritage Foundation, however, say that the White House, in order to arrive at its discretionary figures, used some accounting gimmicks. Chiefly, they say, the White House reclassified $54 billion of surface transportation spending from discretionary to mandatory spending. Voila, discretionary spending goes down. To find the switch, see the Table S-7 of the White House budget, which notes changes to the budget baselines and specifically quantifies the yearly budget impact from "reclassifying surface transportation outlays." Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst at Heritage, said it reminded him of an old satirical headline from The Onion: "Eight Million Americans Rescued From Poverty With Redefinition Of Term." Moving surface transportation spending into the mandatory category was actually a recommendation of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, which said it wanted to reconcile the discretionary treatment of outlays with the treatment of contract authority, which is mandatory. So the White House may have a sound argument for shifting that highway money to the mandatory spending category. Nonetheless, it makes the discretionary spending bottom line look better without any heavy lifting. Riedl also argued that White House projections for discretionary spending beyond Obama's presidency are largely meaningless. Discretionary spending is set by the president and Congress each year. "Any number after 2012 is just a placeholder," Riedl said. "I'm more interested in the numbers for next year," Riedl said. In 2012, non-security discretionary spending under Obama's proposed budget would come to 3.4 percent of GDP. According to the White House graphic, that percentage would rival the highest levels in the last 20 years or so. But Obama talked about "bringing" the numbers to Eisenhower levels; he didn't say it would happen next year. So basing the claim on what is projected to happen in 2015 seems reasonable. And almost any way you slice it -- by non-defense, non-security or even total discretionary spending -- if the White House budget projections for 2015 hold up, they would be at the lowest levels, as a percentage of GDP, since the early 1960s at least. But given that Obama's term ends after 2012 (unless he's re-elected), we think there is some merit to the criticism that "projections" about future reductions to discretionary spending are far less meaningful than the ones proposed for the following year. And, while shifting highway money from discretionary to mandatory spending may make sense, it does skew the picture when making comparisons to previous years when it was considered discretionary. So we rate Obama's claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-02-16T16:58:28	2011-02-14	['White_House', 'Dwight_D._Eisenhower']
pomt-10025	Republican leaders said "no" to "tax cuts for 95% of working Americans."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/09/americans-united-change/republicans-opposed-obamas-stimulus-not-tax-cuts/	In its latest installment of cable ads suggesting that Rush Limbaugh is the de facto leader of the Republican Party, the liberal Americans United for Change takes Republican leaders to task for failing to support the Democrats' economic stimulus package. In particular, we were intrigued by the counterintuitive suggestion that several prominent Republicans are against tax cuts for working families. "Republican leaders," the announcer begins. "Their policies created the worst economic crisis in a generation. "But what did they say to President Obama’s recovery plan?" A series of "no's" follow from Republican leaders, set to Jacques Offenbach's can-can from "Orpheus in the Underworld" (you'll know it when you hear it, and yes, we had to look that up). The four leaders: Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate; John Boehner, the leader of Republicans in the House; Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip; and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. "…To tax cuts for 95% of working Americans?" This time, the chorus of "no's" come courtesy of Sen. Jim DeMint; Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin; Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee; and McConnell. We're not even sure what Palin and Steele are doing here. Palin and Steele do not serve in the U.S. Congress. They could not vote on the stimulus plan. So their stated opposition to the bill amounted to nothing more than opinion. And the opinions they offered did not speak directly to the proposed tax cuts. More important, though, is the suggestion that these Republicans oppose tax cuts for working Americans. The stimulus package signed by Obama includes a tax credit for workers intended to offset payroll taxes. Single workers would get $400 and working couples would get $800. We have looked at this proposal in the past and confirmed that it would result in tax cuts for 95 percent of working families. And yes, most Republicans voted against that economic stimulus package. But Republican opposition to the bill overwhelmingly focused on the spending portion of the plan. Here's what Palin said about the stimulus plan in a news release: "The governor recognizes that some form of economic stimulus is necessary, but not the bill that passed the Congress Friday. She has advocated for a package that includes federal spending for infrastructure, tax breaks for individuals and small businesses, and measures to address the housing situation. The governor believes the current legislation is too large and is not sufficiently focused on these objectives." We note that Palin specifically states her support for a plan that includes "tax breaks for individuals." So what about the two Republicans in the ad who did vote against the bill? DeMint offered an alternative to the Democrats' stimulus plan called "The American Option." In a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation on Jan. 29, 2009, DeMint lambasted the Democrats' stimulus spending as wasteful and reckless. His plan, developed by J.D. Foster and William Beach of the Heritage Foundation, would make permanent the temporary tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 — now set to expire in 2011. DeMint also proposed to cut tax rates nearly across the board. According to Foster, DeMint's plan eliminated any tax relief to those who pay no income tax; Foster and DeMint have likened that to welfare. The only ones who wouldn't get a tax cut under that plan are people paying less than 10 percent now, Foster said. The DeMint plan also called for permanent repeal of the alternative minimum tax; permanently extending the $1,000 per child tax credit; and repeal of the "marriage tax" penalty. Sounds to us like a tax break for working Americans. Asked about the Americans United for Change ad, a spokeswoman in McConnell's office noted that McConnell (and DeMint) voted in favor of an amendment to the stimulus package offered by Sen. John McCain that they say would have provided tax relief to all income tax payers. The McCain amendment, which failed by a party-line vote of 40 to 57, called for approximately $275 billion in tax cuts. McCain said it "would eliminate the 3.1 percent payroll tax for all employees for one year and use general revenues to pay for the Social Security obligation. It would allocate $60 billion to lower the 10 percent tax bracket to 5 percent for one year. It would lower the 15 percent tax bracket to 10 percent for one year." In other words, the Republican plans included tax breaks for workers too. Just not the variety proposed by the Obama administration. So yes, DeMint and McConnell voted against the Democratic stimulus plan. But they said they did so mostly because of objections to the spending portion of the plan. And they offered alternatives that included tax cuts for working families. To be sure, there are big differences in the distribution of tax cuts proposed by the two sides. But to say Republicans opposed tax cuts for working families based on opposition to the stimulus package grossly distorts the Republican position. We rate the ad's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15040	When ICE releases illegal immigrants, "a lot of those people are not from Honduras and Mexico. They’re from Iraq and Somalia and Russia."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/oct/01/ben-carson/ben-carson-says-lot-released-illegal-immigrants-ar/	Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson says the federal government has failed to secure the border and is releasing "hardened criminals" who are trying to invade the United States -- including from Iraq. Criticism about the federal government releasing criminal illegal immigrants has been a familiar talking point during the GOP presidential primary following the murder this summer of a woman in San Francisco by a convicted felon who had previously been deported. In a Sept. 25, 2015, speech at the Family Research Council’s Values Voter Summit, Carson said that after a trip to the Mexican border, he found that "anybody could get through there." Then he made a claim about how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement releases illegal immigrants: "And then, you know, when they capture people, ICE tells them to release them. And a lot of those people are not from Honduras and Mexico. They’re from Iraq and Somalia and Russia. And many of them are hardened criminals. And it seems like our federal government is actually fighting against the sheriffs and the people who are down there." Two days later, Martha Raddatz of ABC News asked Carson if he had evidence that many were hardened criminals from those countries. Carson, a GOP presidential candidate from West Palm Beach, Fla., replied: "Well, I talked to a number of the sheriffs on the borders and they've told me what kind of people are coming over. So I'm not sure that I would trust, quite frankly, any figures coming from the government, given the fact that they are the ones who are problematic." We decided to check whether "a lot" of illegal immigrants who are released are from Iraq, Somalia and Russia. We couldn’t find comprehensive data on the citizenship of those who are released, but within the universe of those who are apprehended, only a tiny speck are from the countries cited by Carson. Pinal County, Arizona Carson campaign spokesman Doug Watts told us to call Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu in Arizona. Carson met with Babeu when he visited the Arizona-Mexico border in August. Babeu blasted the federal government for releasing three criminal illegal immigrants this summer who were from Iraq, Russia and Sudan (not Somalia, as Carson said). That included Dennis Valerievitch Tsoukanov of Russia, who set a police informant on fire; Musa Salah Abdelaziz Abdalla of Sudan, who had been convicted of assault; and Nasser Hanna Hermez of Iraq, who had been convicted of negligent homicide in the death of his infant daughter. In all three cases, after they had finished any term of incarceration, they were turned over to ICE, which then later released the men. ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea told PolitiFact that "ICE under current law can no longer legally hold the three individuals." Hermez is a legal permanent resident whose conviction does not make him eligible for deportation. The other two were foreign nationals who were released based on the Supreme Court decision in Zadvydas vs. Davis. That ruling prevents ICE from indefinitely holding individuals if it’s unlikely that ICE can actually deport them. These two men were ordered to report regularly to an ICE officer. Tim Gaffney, director of administration for the Pinal County Sheriff's Office, told PolitiFact that law enforcement had seen an increase in a group referred to as "special interest aliens" who are from 35 countries with terrorist ties, including Iraq and Somalia. Gaffney sent PolitiFact an excerpt from a report produced by the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center and other agencies which stated that during the first 10 months of fiscal year 2014, Border Patrol apprehended 402 "special interest aliens" with more than half of them from Bangladesh. The three countries cited by Carson, however, were not included in the excerpt. (Gaffney said he couldn’t provide the whole report because it is "law-enforcement sensitive.") We also found news articles that cited examples of illegal immigrants with ties to terrorist groups who had been caught along the border. But none of the articles we saw backed up Carson’s argument that any significant number of illegal immigrants were from Iraq, Somalia and Russia. The most we could find were articles like one from February, in which the Houston Chronicle posted a report from the Texas Department of Public Safety that stated that it had come in contact with special interest aliens including from Somalia with terrorist ties. There were additional news articles about two different Somali men with terrorist ties accused of smuggling Somalis into the United States. But none of these reports suggest that there are "a lot" of people from those nations. Illegal immigrants apprehended or removed We also looked at broader data from federal officials to gauge the frequency of aliens from the countries Carson cited. The most comprehensive data comes from the Department of Homeland Security’s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. That data shows that for 2013 there were 662,483 aliens apprehended, including 169 from Iraq, 320 from Russia and 214 from Somalia. So, combined, the illegal immigrants from these countries add up to less than 1 percent of the total. The largest groups of illegal immigrants were from Mexico (424,978), Guatemala (73,208) and Honduras (64,157). We obtained more current data from the U.S. Border Patrol which showed the number of apprehensions by citizenship for 1.2 million deportable aliens between fiscal year 2013 and August 2015. Let’s look at the countries cited by Carson: Total deportable aliens Honduras Mexico Iraq Russia Somalia Fiscal year 2013 420,789 46,865 267,734 5 32 7 Fiscal year 2014 486,651 91,475 229,178 7 30 6 Fiscal year 2015 through August 306,288 30,067 172,932 7 17 1 Totals 1,213,728 168,407 669,844 17 79 14 Percent of total 13.9 % 55% .001% .006% .001% Source: U.S. Border Patrol Still, Carson referred to the citizenship of illegal immigrants who were released by ICE, so we went in search of that data. Illegal immigrants released According to ICE data, the agency released 36,007 criminals in 2013 and 30,558 in 2014. The most common reason for the releases was due to a court order. However, data on country of origin for illegal immigrants who were released was not immediately available from ICE. We did find some efforts to fill in the blanks. Jeremy Redmon of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution documented cases in which the person’s country of origin refused to take them, which led to their release. The Journal-Constitution created a map to show 9,000 incidents of such illegal immigrants in cases between January 2012 and June 2014. He obtained the data through the federal Freedom of Information Act. The countries that had the highest numbers of those released because their country wouldn’t take them were Cuba (2,348), Vietnam (779), Laos (465), Honduras (450), El Salvador (419), Mexico (346) and Guatemala (336). By contrast, 47 detainees were released from Russia, 153 from Somalia and 136 from Iraq. Of course, this is only one subset of illegal immigrants who were released; however, it is one more piece of evidence that shows certain Latin American countries have higher numbers of illegal immigrants caught here than most other nations. Jessica M. Vaughan, an expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said she has examined unpublished Border Patrol data on the citizenship of those apprehended and "noted that there are some individuals from Middle Eastern countries apprehended each year at the land border, although not a large number." Our ruling Carson says that when ICE releases illegal immigrants "a lot of those people are not from Honduras and Mexico. They’re from Iraq and Somalia and Russia." Carson pointed to information from just one sheriff in Arizona, and even here he garbled the information -- the sheriff criticized the federal government for releasing three criminal illegal immigrants from Iraq, Russia and Sudan, not Somalia. When we looked at the broad sweep of data, we saw nothing to indicate that the three countries Carson cited account for a significant share of illegal immigrants. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"White House chef quits because Trump has only eaten fast food for 6 months," read the headline on a July 6, 2017, article on HalfwayPost.com. The post said that White House chef Lisa Mead hasn’t cooked a single meal since Trump took office, instead being forced to "retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton." Sources in the story described particular preparation methods Trump favored for his food, which people quoted in the story found difficult to stomach. The post described Trump eating only the skin and fat from Kentucky Fried Chicken and making Mead remove all the brown M&M’s from a McDonald’s McFlurry. While Trump has been known to favor Col. Sanders at times, this story is ersatz news dressed up as a true story. As an appetizer, we should note that the White House executive chef is Cristeta Comerford, not anyone named Lisa Mead. The First Lady’s office confirmed Comerford still runs the kitchen, a job she has held since 2005. (There is a mention of the factual recent resignation of Office of Government Ethics director Walter Shaub Jr.) But the real meat of this claim is that HalfwayPost.com identifies itself as being full of contrived stories. The page header denotes the site as "a St. Louis gazette of satirical, halfway real news." It’s "About the Halfway Post" page said the staff is "prone to satirical giggles, so if a headline seems too outlandish to be true it’s probably because we made it up." We attempted to contact the site through their online contact form, but did not receive a reply. Trump’s culinary preferences have been a topic in the media before. He’s shown a fondness for taco bowls and had promised during his presidential campaign to feed Chinese President Xi Jinping "a double-size Big Mac" if he were to visit the White House. Trump opted instead to offer a more traditional steak and fish during Xi’s trip to the United States in April, but that was at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. But in this case, people who don’t notice HalfwayPost.com’s warnings that its content is all empty calories may be left with a sour taste. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-07840	"Between Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas over 8,000 same-sex couples are raising children."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/14/get-equal-texas/get-equal-texas-says-over-8000-gay-couples-raising/	A Texas group promoting plans by gay couples to seek marriage licenses on Valentine’s Day issued a Feb. 9 press release suggesting it speaks for many urban parents. "Between Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas over 8,000 same-sex couples are raising children," said Michael Diviesti, state coordinator of GetEQUAL TX, part of a self-described national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights group advocating legal and social equality. Says who? In response to our query, Diviesti told us most of his parental count was drawn from reported research by Gary Gates, a scholar at the University of California-Los Angeles. He pointed us to a Jan. 25 article on Gates’ work in the Dallas Voice, a gay-oriented newspaper, featuring a chart stating there are 3,178 gay couples raising children in Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, 2,458 in Houston-Sugarland-Baytown and 1,180 in San Antonio-New Braunfels, accounting for 6,816 couples in those metropolitan statisical areas. The chart doesn’t specify what year it covers nor the number of gay couples raising children in the Austin area. The article says the study was highlighted in a New York Times news article. That story, published Jan. 18, quotes Gates saying that survey data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau indicates there were about 581,000 same-sex couples in the United States in 2009. The Times’ story says Gates has concluded that child rearing among same-sex couples is more common in the South than in any other region of the country and that gay couples in states such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas are more likely to be raising children than their counterparts on the West Coast, in New York and in New England. One factor, the story says, is that a large number of gay couples, possibly a majority, previously had children with partners in heterosexual relationships. Some 34 percent of same-sex couples in San Antonio are raising children, Gates is quoted saying, placing the city No. 1 nationally. Separately, Diviesti also noted a January 2008 online post by the Williams Institute, a UCLA School of Law think tank that says it advances sexual orientation law and public policy through independent research. The post states that according to census data, some 20 percent--or 10,000--of almost 50,000 same-sex couples in Texas were raising children as of 2005. The same year, the post says, an estimated 17,444 of Texas’s children were living in households headed by same-sex couples. In response to our inquiry about how many gay couples are raising children in Austin, Diviesti said that in compiling numbers for the press release, he mistakenly used a 2000 census figure for same-sex couples in Travis County--2,984--for his Austin number."I was in a rush to find the statistic," Diviesti said. He said his error probably makes his figure of more than 8,000 about 1,000 too high. Next, we contacted Gates, who said the information in the Times’ story came from his analysis of annual census survey numbers. Gates added via e-mail: "These are not statistics that the Census Bureau provides on its public website. Instead, they are my own analyses of Public Use Microdata Samples that are made available each year. The analyses combine data from 2005-2009 in order to get sufficient samples sizes of the same-sex couples." Gates told us his latest review suggests there are 945 same-sex couples raising children in the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metropolitan statistical area. We added that to his reported estimates of same-sex couples raising children in the three other Texas areas, and got 7,761. We asked Gates if he did, or could, narrow his area-wide estimates to the cities singled out by the Texas group. He said he did not and that it would be difficult to do so. One factor that complicates the calculation: "There likely is a meaningful difference as I believe that city residents (generally and among same-sex couples) are less likely to be raising children than suburban couples." All told, it appears that 7,761 same-sex couples--not more than 8,000--are raising children in metropolitan statistical areas that include Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas. That total is even lower if referencing the cities alone, as the statement does, though by how much is hard to say. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-07387	Says using E-Verify is "a fair amount of cost," about $20 per person that does not match.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/may/03/jd-alexander/sen-jd-alexander-questions-e-verify-costs/	The man running a controversial immigration bill through the Florida Senate says he opposes a requirement that employers use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of their employees. Sen. J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, says he knows first-hand about the federal system -- since he uses it as a farmer and citrus grower. Alexander says E-Verify is flawed, and costly for business. The Senate is scheduled to debate the immigration bill, SB 2040, and the E-Verify component on May 3, 2011. Details of the entire bill remain unknown. But Alexander has pretty much made his position known, saying he will try to remove any E-Verify requirement. "It takes a while to really know the answer," he said of E-Verify. "It has the potential of being wrong." And, he said, "it's a fair amount of cost" -- about $20 per person who isn't eligible to work. "It's fairly expensive." Alexander noted to reporters that he's short about 100 people to pick a blueberry crop. "For all the unemployment, there just are not folks who want to come out and pick blueberries," he said, for about $9 an hour. As the debate continues, we wanted to touch on Alexander's concern about cost. The E-Verify system is a federal database that compares information from a person's employment paperwork to Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers who use the program can weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country. Once employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don't match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the workers eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility. Critics like Alexander complain that the database is inaccurate and needs improvement. More than a dozen states require the use of the system in one form or another, whether it's for state workers, state contractors, or for all or most all employers. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott issued Executive Order 11-02 in his first hours in office requiring the use of the system for executive agency workers and state contractors. He has promised to extend that order to all state employers. The system can be accessed at no charge -- meaning employers don't have to pay the federal government to use E-Verify. But that doesn't mean Alexander is wrong in making his claim about the cost to businesses. A Florida Senate analysis notes only that the mandatory use of E-Verify "may have an economic impact on private employers." Employers must either dedicate personnel to learn the system and perform the background checks, or hire third-party agents to do the work for employers. In either scenario, there is a cost. The federal government performed a detailed regulatory analysis of the cost federal contractors would be expected to incur by using the E-Verify system. The analysis concluded, for instance, that it would take a human relations official about 10 minutes to register to use the system, and then another 1.4 hours for an HR employee and lawyer to review the E-Verify memorandum of understanding. The analysis includes the computer, Internet and printer costs, and found that it takes five minutes for someone to enter a worker's information into the E-Verify system, and an additional five minutes if that worker is required to provide photo identification. There also is a cost associated should a worker dispute the E-Verify findings, according to the government analysis. And finally, there is a replacement cost to find workers to take the place of those who cannot pass the E-Verify system. In conclusion, the government found that the average direct cost to a contractor with 10 employees would be $1,254 in the initial year. For contractors with 50 employees, the average cost of participating in E-Verify would be $3,163 in the initial year. For a contractor with 100 employees, the cost would be $5,615. And for a contractor with 500 employees, the cost would be $24,422. The costs would be less in subsequent years, the government found. The ongoing cost for a 10-employee company would be $156 a year, $440 for a 50-employee company, $802 for a 100-employee company, and $3,261 for a 500-employee company. Finally, we checked with Hunter Employment, a third-party vendor that performs E-Verify checks for workers in Arizona -- where E-Verify is required. Hunter charges $50 for a company to enroll to use its services and an annual fee of $25 thereafter. On top of that, Hunter charges a $7.50 fee for each employee verified by Hunter Employment through the E-Verify program. That would be on top of any personnel time incurred by the company to process the agreement with Hunter, as well as other miscellaneous costs. Alexander said one of the reasons he doesn't support mandating E-Verify is because it has "a fair amount of cost," about $20 per person that does not match. Our analysis shows that there is indeed a cost to using the system -- though it's technically free. First, the cost shouldn't necessarily be different if a person isn't verified by the system, except that an employer will incur additional costs to replace that prospective worker. And second, while Alexander's figure of $20 per employer isn't too far out of line based on the statistics we've seen, the cost does depend on how many employees are being checked, and whether a business decides to process the E-Verify checks by themselves or through a third-party company. So, we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	J.D. Alexander	None	None	None	2011-05-03T11:46:45	2011-04-29	['None']
pomt-02806	"Just days ago, Iran's Supreme Leader (Ali) Khamenei, who will oversee implementation of this agreement, was calling Israel a 'rabid dog' and accusing the United States of war crimes."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/27/marco-rubio/iranian-official-called-israel-rabid-dog-accused-u/	Forget the Senate’s "nuclear option." Congress’s latest point of tension is the nuclear deal with Iran. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is among those opposed to the six-month deal, in which the United States agreed to lessen sanctions on Iran in exchange for certain limits placed on Iran’s growing nuclear program. The deal was brokered by the P5+1, the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany. In his press release, Rubio highlighted a notoriously rocky relationship between the two countries, calling Iran a "rogue state." He went on to criticize the country’s leadership. "Just days ago, Iran's Supreme Leader (Ali) Khamenei, who will oversee implementation of this agreement, was calling Israel a 'rabid dog' and accusing the United States of war crimes," he said. We wanted to see if Rubio’s claim was right and what evidence it was based on. Khamenei’s role We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s office, but we found that Khamenei gave a speech on Nov. 20, prior to the public announcement of the agreement. Khamenei is Iran’s appointed supreme leader and the country’s head of state. He holds more power in Iran than even President Hassan Rouhani, who is widely considered a moderate. Many analysts credit Rouhani’s election with making the recent agreement possible. As we’ll see, Khamenei’s takes a more hard-line approach toward both the United States and Israel than Rouhani. Khamenei is in charge of all of Iran’s foreign policy, including the nuclear agreement. But it’s worth noting that since he’s so high-ranking, he won’t be heavily involved in day-to-day operations -- that’s left to nuclear physicists and other lower-ranking officials. "Rabid dog" U.S. and Iranian news outlets reported that Khamenei said something about a "rabid dog" in a speech Nov. 20, less than a week before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced a deal with Iran. We saw conflicting reports in the direct translation of the phrase from Farsi to English. It wasn’t immediately clear to us whether Khamenei directed the comment toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, all Israeli people or all Jewish people. PolitiFact asked two Farsi-speaking Iranian political science experts for independent translations of the line in question. We showed the experts the Farsi speech transcript published on Khamenei’s official website. We also consulted an English-language video translation from Press TV, a state-owned news outlet in Iran. We found small discrepancies in the exact translation: "Israel is the rabid dog of the region," was the wording Syracuse University Iranian studies professor Mehrzad Boroujerdi put forward, which closely matches many news reports we’ve seen. "These Zionist financiers are really like wild beasts," was the wording Middle East Institute scholar Alex Vatanka gave us. He told us "wild beasts" and "rabid dogs" were not so far off from each other in Farsi. "Zionist financiers," he said, is a clear reference to the Israeli government, especially Netanyahu. "Israeli officials cannot be called humans. They are like animals, some of them." That’s from the Press TV translator. Exact wording aside, the sentiment is largely the same. Khamenei did in fact call either government officials or the country as a whole the animals of the Middle East. That’s consistent with Khamenei’s overall stance, Vatanka said, adding that the leader previously referred to Israel as a "cancerous tumor" on the region. But Khamenei’s comments don’t necessarily reflect the way other Iranian officials or the public feels about Israel, Vatanka added. "War crimes" Rubio also said that Khamenei recently accused the United States of carrying out war crimes. When we watched the speech, we found truth to that. "They committed crimes in Iraq, in Pakistan with drones. Still they are committing crimes with drones," he said, according to the Press TV translation. "In Afghanistan they bombard people and they continue to commit crimes. Anywhere in which they can serve their interests, they will commit crimes including torture, killings, the Guantanamo prison." That’s not an unusual statement for Khamenei. "The man’s position on the United States has always been that the United States is unjust in its policies, it’s arrogant in its policies and it’s not trustworthy," Vatanka said. But at the same time, Khamenei has always supported reaching out to the United States when he feels the timing is right, Vatanka added. "(Iranian officials) would not have been sitting in Geneva negotiating with Kerry if they didn’t have the green light from Khamenei." Our ruling Rubio said, "Just days ago, Iran's Supreme Leader (Ali) Khamenei, who will oversee implementation of this agreement, was calling Israel a 'rabid dog' and accusing the United States of war crimes." Based on expert translations, we confirmed that Khamenei referred to either Israel or the Israeli government as the animals of the Middle East. In the same speech, he criticized the United States, saying they "continue to commit crimes" in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. We rate Rubio’s statement True.

pomt-02475	"According to one study, the minimum wage today is worth $2 less than in 1968."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/feb/21/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-minimum-wage-worth-2-l/	Debate over raising the minimum wage is heating up. President Obama is advocating for it, Democrats in Congress are promoting it and their Republican counterparts are warning that it would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. Adding fuel to that fire was Tuesday's Congressional Budget Office report, which predicted that increasing the minimum wage would lift 900,000 people out of poverty but cost 500,000 jobs. U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, D-RI, went on the floor of the House on Feb. 11 to argue that inflation has eroded the value of the minimum wage, now $7.25 per hour, over time. "It's been five years since those working for the minimum wage have seen an increase in the minimum wage, and according to one study, the minimum wage today is worth $2 less than in 1968. This is shameful, and we have the responsibility to address growing income inequality by increasing the minimum wage immediately," he said. In other words, a worker in 2014 would need to earn $9.25 an hour to have the same buying power a minimum-wage worker had in 1968. We wondered whether that was true. Cicilline's office wouldn't say what study the congressman was referring to. When we asked Cicilline about it during a Feb. 18 news conference, he said couldn't recall. Instead, his chief of staff said a Google search had just uncovered a June 2013 Huffington Post article headlined, "The Minimum Wage Is Worth $2 Less Today Than It Was In 1968: Study." The Huffington Post article cites a study from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal Washington, D.C. think tank funded by organized labor, that quotes the $2 figure but doesn't analyze the minimum wage directly. Instead, it quotes another EPI study that did, looking at the minimum wage value from 1968 through 2012. It reports that the 1968 minimum wage of $1.60 per hour was essentially worth $9.25 in 2012 dollars, precisely two dollars less than $7.25. But what was the difference when Cicilline gave his speech this month? The latest EPI study, issued Dec. 19 by David Cooper, puts that difference at $2.15. When we tried to confirm that calculation by going to the online inflation calculator from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we came up with an amount that was even higher: It said that today's $7.25 minimum wage is worth $3.46 less than in 1968, a much bigger difference than what Cicilline cited. Why the difference? The online calculator, Cooper said, uses the conventional Consumer Price Index, known as CPI-U. He and other researchers use a variant of that, called the CPI-U-RS, which tries to take the modifications that have been made to the CPI-U over the years and apply them to previous years. Although the government doesn't claim one index is better than another, he said the CPI-U-RS is designed to do a better job of accurately capturing the changing value of the minimum wage. If you adjust an old minimum wage for inflation using the traditional CPI, its value appears much higher today. In summary, Cicilline says he was quoting a report, but we're not sure what report that was. There is a report that supports his claim, as his staff noted, but it's out of date. He said the buying power of the minimum wage in 1968 was, in effect, $2 higher than its value today. The difference in 2013 dollars, by one measure, is actually $2.15. That's pretty close. By another measure, it's even more: $3.46. His underlying point -- that the minimum wage has significantly less buying power than it had 45 years ago -- is correct, and the erosion in the minimum wage is even more dramatic if you use the conventional cost of living index. We rate his statement Mostly True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-10213	Palin "inherited a city with zero debt, but left it with indebtedness of over $22-million."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/09/chain-email/numbers-right-context-missing/	In a widely circulated e-mail written by Wasilla resident Anne Kilkenny, she challenged Gov. Sarah Palin's portrait as a fiscal conservative when she ran the city of Wasilla, Alaska, as its mayor from 1996 to 2002. In Kilkenny's e-mail, she highlights several budget statistics to make her point. ( Read it for yourself here. ) We'll take them one by one, and then get to some counterpoint arguments from current Wasilla Mayor Dianne M. Keller. • "Sarah campaigned in Wasilla as a 'fiscal conservative.' During her 6 years as mayor, she increased general government expenditures by over 33 percent." According to figures provided by the city of Wasilla, the operating budget for Wasilla went from $6,050,160 in fiscal year 1996 to $9,393,768 in 2002. That's a 55 percent increase. But adjusted for inflation, it's a 35 percent increase. • "During those same 6 years the amount of taxes collected by the city increased by 38 percent." According to a review of Wasilla's financial reports, the amount of revenue taken in during 1996 was $6,070,806; and rose to $8,710,166 in 2002. That's a 43 percent increase. Adjusted for inflation, that comes to a 25 percent increase. • "She reduced progressive property taxes and increased a recessive sales tax which taxed even food." Under Palin, property tax rates did, in fact, go down; and the sales tax did go up from 2 percent to 2.5 percent. And yes, the sales tax includes food (though there are exemptions for such things as medicine). • "The huge increases in tax revenues during her mayoral administration weren't enough to fund everything on her wish list though, borrowed money was needed, too. She inherited a city with zero debt, but left it with indebtedness of over $22-million. What did Mayor Palin encourage the voters to borrow money for? Was it the infrastructure that she said she supported? The sewage treatment plant that the city lacked? Or a new library? No. $1-million for a park, $15-million-plus for construction of a multi-use sports complex...She also supported bonds for $5.5-million for road projects that could have been done in 5-7 years without any borrowing." The city of Wasilla has made available all of its budgets during Palin's tenure. So we grabbed the fiscal year ending 1996 (when Palin took the reins), which showed the city's long-term debt at $1.12-million, mostly for paving and sewer projects. The annual financial report for fiscal year ending June 30, 2002 — Palin's last year in office — shows that the total long-term debt was $24.8-million. So Kilkenny is off a bit when she says long-term debt went from zero to $22-million. But it did increase $23.7-million. And Kilkenny is also correct about the big-ticket items that created the debt: $14.7-million for a new multi-use sports complex; $5.5-million for street projects; and $3-million for water improvement projects. Factually, Kilkenny's claims about the budget are true. But the conclusions that Kilkenny reaches are a matter of debate. Current Mayor Diane M. Keller, who served on the City Council when Palin was mayor, said just presenting those raw figures is misleading. Yes, she said, Wasilla's budgets increased and tax receipts went up under Palin's reign, but much of that was due to the growth of the city during those six years. Yes, she said, the sales tax rate went from 2 percent to 2.5 percent under Palin, but that was approved via voter referendum, with the extra proceeds earmarked specifically to pay off that sports complex. CBS News reported that the referendum on the sports complex passed by just 20 votes. Due to the economic growth in the community, Keller said, Wasilla is going to be able to stop charging that extra .5 percent sales tax two years earlier than anticipated. The property tax rate was reduced under Palin from 2 mills to .5 mills (it was later eliminated under Keller). Voters also okayed the bond issue to pay for road improvements, Keller noted. "The people in our community wanted road improvements," Keller said. "The taxpayers voted on it. Same thing with the sports complex. It's up to us to do what the people are asking for." The U.S. Census does not provide yearly population estimates before 2000, but Wasilla's population grew by about 13 percent in the last two years of Palin's mayorship alone. It stands to reason that a town's budget will grow as the population rises. And if voters okayed the bond issues for the sports complex and road projects, as well as for the sales tax increase, we think it's a little misleading to pin them entirely on the mayor, even if she did lobby for them. But Kilkenny's numbers are mostly accurate, so we rule her statements about Wasilla's finances under Palin Mostly True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-09-09T00:00:00	2008-08-31	['None']

pomt-02046	"Milwaukee has the second-highest" number of children recovered from sex trafficking.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/01/gwen-moore/milwaukee-among-cities-worst-child-sex-trafficking/	More than two years before U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore described Milwaukee as one of the worst places in the country for child sex trafficking, there were reasons to think it might be so. In the space of two weeks in early 2012, two Milwaukee pimps were sentenced to long prison terms. One, who had painted the words "Ho Hauler" on his van and shipped child prostitutes to Chicago and elsewhere to sell sex, got 30 years behind bars. The other, who gained fame in movies and on television as "Pimp Snooky," had prostituted scores of women and girls in cities from Milwaukee to Las Vegas for at least 16 years, according to federal prosecutors. He got 20 years. Still, it was startling on May 20, 2014 when Moore spoke on the House floor in favor of a bill that aims to help underage victims of prostitution. The House passed the measure later that day. "I’m embarrassed and I regret to report that my own hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has become known as a sex-trafficking hub for both children and adults," said Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat. "As a matter of fact, the FBI reports that Milwaukee has the second-highest in the nation for recovered youth. But trafficking is now common in communities all across the country, not just urban, but suburban, rural, from coast to coast." Second in the nation is something we wanted to check. Sex trafficking crackdown In July 2013, 10 months before Moore made her claim, the FBI announced what it described as its seventh and largest-ever child sex trafficking enforcement action. Over three days and across 76 cities, officers arrested 153 pimps and identified more than 105 children as having been sexually exploited. Milwaukee tied with Detroit for the second-highest number of children recovered, as the FBI puts it, with 10. San Francisco was first, with 12. It turns out that’s what Moore was referring to when she made her second-in-the-nation claim, according to her spokeswoman, Staci Cox. "When reading her statement on the House floor, the Congresswoman inadvertently did not specify the context in which the statistic was based," Cox told us. The results of one enforcement action, of course, do not establish Milwaukee as having the nation's second-highest child sex trafficking recoveries. So, the question remains: Just how serious is child sex trafficking in Milwaukee? In May 2013, a Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission study, which was based on contacts youths had with Milwaukee police, estimated that 77 youths had been "sex trafficked" during the two-year period ending on Aug. 1, 2012. Those youths were in addition to those who were involved in sex trafficking cases that were investigated or prosecuted by federal authorities during the period. The study defined trafficked as minors who were "suspected or known to have been recruited, encouraged, or obtained for the purpose of a commercial sex act or sexually explicit performance." They were primarily African-American girls ages 12 to 17 who lived on the city's north side. But how does that level of sex trafficking compare with other cities? No one knows. There is no reliable ranking of cities in terms of child sex trafficking or, using the statistic Moore cited, the number of children recovered from sex trafficking. That’s according to the Polaris Project, which runs the National Human Resource Center Trafficking Hotline for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire. "We have not heard of any systematic effort to count these cases and much of the effort to track this down has turned to dead ends," Finkelhor told us. Finkelhor noted that, even if there were more police contacts in Milwaukee than in other cities regarding child sex trafficking, it could mean the problem is worse in Milwaukee -- or it could simply mean that Milwaukee police are more proactive. As for the children being recovered from sex trafficking, it’s "very misleading," Finkelhour told us. "Police do a variety of things when they encounter youth engaged in selling sex -- from arresting them, to making referrals to agencies, to bringing them back to their families -- but most of the professionals in the field agree that large numbers of youth return to the streets or to commercial sex activity," Finkelhor said. "The whole narrative on this topic is filled with problems." Our rating Moore said "Milwaukee has the second-highest" number of children recovered from sex trafficking. Pimp prosecutions, FBI crackdowns and a local study have established that child sex trafficking is a serious problem in Milwaukee. But Moore acknowledges she didn’t state her claim accurately. There simply is no comprehensive data available comparing cities on the extent of the problem, nor on the number of children who are recovered from the trafficking. We rate Moore’s statement False.

pomt-05826	"If you look at states that are right to work, they constantly do not have budget deficits and they have very good business climates."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/19/nicholas-kettle/rhode-island-state-sen-nicholas-kettle-says-states/	State Sen. Nicholas D. Kettle wants Rhode Island to become the first "right-to-work" state in the Northeast -- a place where workers in union jobs could choose to opt out of union membership and paying dues. The freshman Republican from Coventry has introduced one piece of legislation that would make union membership optional for teachers and another that would put a non-binding referendum on November’s ballot asking voters to support a right-to-work law for all people in Rhode Island. On Jan. 27, he appeared on WHJJ’s "The Helen Glover Show" to talk about the bills. "If Rhode Island became a right-to-work state in general, that would be a huge magnet to draw business here," said Glover. "It would certainly do a lot to move us out of that ‘worst place to do business’ that apparently everybody knows about." "Absolutely, and you don’t have to look very far for what works," Kettle responded. "If you look at states that are right to work, they constantly do not have budget deficits and they have very good business climates. So Rhode Island just needs to a pass a right-to-work law and that would help out this state tremendously, along with other legislation that needs to occur to help out the business community." Other fact-checking organizations, including PolitiFact National, have looked into similar statements that connected right-to-work laws to economic benefits, including higher job creation and lower unemployment rates. Although they found proof of a correlation, they could not prove causation. Kettle pointed to two different indicators of fiscal health in right-to-work states: a lack of budget deficits and good business climates. For the first, he referred us to a report on past, current and projected budget deficits from the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C. He also gave us a list of right-to-work states compiled by the nonprofit National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, of Springfield, Va. Twenty-three states have enacted right-to-work laws since 1947 when passage of the federal Taft-Hartley Act first allowed them to do so. Indiana was the most recent state to join the list -- and the first since Oklahoma in 2001 -- after Gov. Mitch Daniels signed right-to-work legislation on Jan. 31, 2012. For this analysis, however, we are not including Indiana as a right-to-work state because the most recent economic data available predates the signing of the legislation. So to be clear, the right-to-work states we’re examining are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming. That’s 22 in all. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which compiled figures for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, 45 states were facing budget deficits for the 2012 fiscal year. Nineteen of them are right-to-work states. As of Jan. 9, most states had closed their shortfalls, but seven, including one right-to-work state, were still facing mid year gaps. For the 2013 fiscal year, 29 states are facing shortfalls. Eight right-to-work states are on the list. Because Kettle said that right-to-work states "constantly," or consistently, do not have deficits, we looked at the three most recent years, too. For 2009, 2010 and 2011, nearly all of the so-called "union" states and the right-to-work states had projected deficits. It’s clear from the data that few states -- whether right-to-work or states that require workers to pay dues to the unions that represent them -- have escaped financial hardship during the recession. For the second part of Kettle’s claim -- that right-to-work states have good business climates -- he directed us to a Wall Street Journal commentary published last year in which Harvard economist Robert Barro said, "There is evidence that right-to-work laws -- or, more broadly, the pro-business policies offered by right-to-work states -- matter for economic growth." Barro cited a 1997 study that compared employment in counties close with the border between states with and without right-to-work laws. The 1997 study, done by University of Minnesota economist Thomas J. Holmes summarizes overall job growth in states with and without right-to-work laws. "Manufacturing employment in the states without right-to-work laws is virtually the same now as it was in 1947, but manufacturing employment has increased 150 percent in the right-to-work states," he wrote. "Of the 10 states with the highest manufacturing employment growth rates, 8 are right-to-work states; of the 10 states with the lowest growth rates, none is a right-to-work state." In his more localized research, Holmes found that from 1947 to 1992, in areas within 25 miles of the state borders he looked at, manufacturing job growth was 26 percentage points higher in right-to-work states than in union states. But Holmes was not able to pinpoint right-to-work laws as the reason for the difference. "First, the results do not say which policies matter," he wrote. "Right-to-work states historically have pursued a number of other smokestack-chasing policies, such as low taxes, aggressive subsidies, and even, in some cases, lax environmental regulations. Thus, my results do not say that it is right-to-work laws that matter, but rather that the ‘pro-business package’ offered by right-to-work states seems to matter." Because Kettle used the words "business climate," we also decided to look at indexes that rank states in that particular area. We considered the most recent rankings done by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, CNBC, Forbes and the Tax Foundation. The majority of the states at the top of those rankings have right-to-work laws and the majority at the bottom do not. We also contacted Joseph A. McCartin, a Georgetown history professor who is an expert on the history of labor and opposes right-to-work laws. He pointed to a study by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute that showed that despite passage of a right-to-work law in Oklahoma in 2001, its unemployment rate has increased at about the same rate as six of its neighbors, all union states, over the last decade. The only study we found that attempted to isolate the effects of right-to-work laws is a working paper by economists at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and Claremont McKenna College. The authors focused on Idaho and Oklahoma, the two most recent right-to-work states before Indiana. They found evidence of increased manufacturing employment in Idaho due to the adoption of a right-to-work law, but not in Oklahoma. Our final call was to Edward M. Mazze, distinguished professor of business administration at the University of Rhode Island. He said that low energy costs, low taxes and the presence of a skilled work force are the primary factors in creating a good business climate, not a right-to-work law. Our ruling Kettle said not only that right-to-work states do not run deficits, but that they "constantly" do not. But the source he used for this claim clearly shows that since 2009 many right-to-work states have had budget deficits. For 2013, a much smaller share of right-to-work states are facing deficits than union states, but in past years the ratios have been very close. Clearly, then, this part of the claim is not accurate. For the second part of the claim -- that business climates are better in right-to-work states -- the research is not as clear. We found one study that found a greater historical increase in manufacturing jobs in select counties in right-to-work states than in neighboring counties in union states. But the author of that study was emphatic in saying that he could not prove that the increase was due to right-to-work laws. And the author of the Wall Street commentary Kettle cites also says pro-business policies matter for growth, not right-to-work laws specifically. The same can be said of the multiple business climate indexes we found. They did generally rank right-to-work states higher than union states, but they considered many other factors, including tax policy, that could account for the better rankings. We could not find any studies to prove Kettle’s claim -- that right-to-work laws lead directly to better business climates. Overall, we rate Kettle’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-00535	Greg Abbott "activated the state guard to monitor" Jade Helm 15 "in case the troops try to impose martial law, disarm innocent Texans, and detain them in tunnels beneath closed Walmart stores."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/jun/19/doonesbury/doonesbury-says-greg-abbott-activated-texas-state-/	Doonesbury, the long-running lefty comic strip, poked at Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in a June 2015 installment presenting Mike Doonesbury and a buddy chatting about Texas and the federal military exercise that led Abbott to alert the Texas State Guard. In the strip published June 14, 2015, buddy Bernie says: "I wonder how they’re making out with Jade Helm 15 in Texas." "What’s Jade Helm 15?" Doonesbury replies. "A military exercise," Bernie replies. "It’s routine, but Gov. Abbott activated the State Guard to monitor it… in case the troops try to impose martial law, disarm innocent Texans, and detain them in tunnels beneath closed Walmart stores." Of course, Doonesbury is satirical. Still, we wondered if the strip accurately recapped Abbott’s actions and motives. Overview: Jade Helm 15 U.S. military officials have described the Jade Helm 15 operations running from July 2015 into September 2015 as a long-planned exercise occurring throughout the Southwest—including parts of Bastrop County near Austin—to include special forces units from multiple armed services, such as Army Green Berets and Navy SEALs. The Army’s Special Operations Command said in an April 2015 press release: "The public can expect nothing much different from their day-to-day activities since much of exercise will be conducted in remote areas. The most noticeable effect the exercise may have on the local communities is an increase in vehicle and military air traffic and its associated noise. There will also be economic gain: an increase in the local economy, in fuel and food purchases and hotel lodging." Still, some eyebrows squinched in reaction to a map for the exercise that came public labeling Texas, Utah and California as "hostile" for training purposes. In April 2015, an Army representative faced numerous hostile questions at a Central Texas meeting. Over two hours, Bastrop-area residents made it clear to Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria of the U.S. Army they had qualms about the exercise being a way for federal forces to take over Texas and much of the Southwest. Lastoria was told he couldn’t be trusted and was asked whether Jade Helm 15 would involve bringing foreign fighters from the Islamic State to Texas, whether U.S. troops would confiscate guns and whether the Army intended to implement martial law. Lastoria’s answer for all three was no. The day after that meeting, Abbott announced he’d told the all-volunteer Texas State Guard to monitor the exercise, though aides said he was not buying into conspiracy theories. Amelia Chasse, an Abbott spokeswoman, was quoted in the Houston Chronicle saying Abbott "deeply trusts and respects the United States military." Doonesbury’s basis By email, Garry Trudeau, the award-winning creator and author of Doonesbury, told us he based Bernie’s statement on Abbott’s directive to the Guard commander that it monitor the exercise "to address concerns of Texas citizens." Trudeau said: "Those ‘concerns,’ expressed in town meetings with the Army, came in the form of highly entertaining conspiracy theories. I included my favorite, although it’s possible the Governor’s actions were prompted by an even nuttier one." "I make no claim as to when or if Guardsmen will report for duty," Trudeau further said, "just that Abbott directed the Guard to be activated for monitor duties, per his letter." Abbott’s letter Abbott indeed wrote a letter, dated April 28, 2015, telling the Guard commander, Major General Gerald "Jake" Betty, to keep an eye on the Jade Helm 15 exercise. That day, Abbott’s office released the letter with a press release stating the governor had delivered the same guidance to Betty in person. Abbott’s letter did not say the Guard was being activated or deployed. It did say: "To address concerns of Texas citizens and to ensure that Texas communities remain safe, secure and informed about military procedures occurring in their vicinity, I am directing the Texas State Guard to monitor Jade Helm 15. "During the Operation’s eight-week training period… I expect to receive regular updates on the progress and safety of the Operation. "During the training operation, it is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed. By monitoring the Operation on a continual basis, the State Guard will facilitate communications between my office and the commanders of the Operation to ensure that adequate measures are in place to protect Texans." Noting U.S. military officials had assured Texas that locations chosen for the exercise would pose no risk to residents or property, Abbott added: "Directing the State Guard to monitor the Operation will allow Texas to be informed of the details of military personnel movements and training exercise schedules, and it will give us the ability to quickly and effectively communicate with local communities, law enforcement, public safety personnel and citizens." His letter closed by stating "the action I take today" comes with support and respect for the nation’s troops. "I remain certain," Abbott wrote, "that our military members will keep America the freest and strongest nation the world has ever known." Six days later, Abbott told reporters "someone has to be in charge with gathering and disseminating information," the Associated Press reported. "We stepped in to play that role, which is a role to be applauded," Abbott said. Asked whether addressing the issue legitimized fringe theories, Abbott said no. He said he was responding to citizen questions, which he said the government has an obligation to answer. "I've seen nothing that would cause anybody to worry about what's going on," Abbott said. Wondering if Abbott’s directive added up to activating the Guard, we left phone messages for Abbott’s press aides and didn’t hear back. Our separate request for an interview with the appropriate Guard official was declined. But the Guard said in an email not attributed to a person: "The directive from the Governor is designed to expedite his communication with USASOC as well as city and county officials by utilizing Major General Betty and the Texas State Guard as his designated representative for this exercise. They understand military operations as well as what details are important to communicate locally in Texas communities." Another Guard email to us indicated its approximately 2,200 troops were not activated in connection with monitoring the exercise: "The Texas State Guard has been called to State Active Duty three times this year," the Guard said, to respond to floods and to support the Texas Department of Public Safety’s Operation Strong Safety near the Texas-Mexico border. On the whole, we didn’t find independent signs of Abbott having concerns about martial law, guns getting taken or underground detentions. Also, before Abbott wrote the commander, his office tried to reassure scores of people calling and writing about the federal plans, the San Antonio Express-News later wrote. Constituents received an email and letter signed by Dede Keith, deputy director of Abbott’s communications division, stating: "Rest assured, this is not a martial law exercise." Trudeau stands by claim Trudeau, in a follow-up reply, said he assumed that by telling the Guard to monitor the exercise, Abbott put in motion an activation of troops to occur once the exercise begins. "While the governor didn't specify which ‘concerns’ he was addressing, his letter was issued in the context of a contemporaneous, well-publicized swirl of conspiracy theories," Trudeau wrote. "What other concerns could he have been talking about?" Our ruling Bernie, a Doonesbury character, said Abbott "activated the state guard to monitor" Jade Helm 15 "in case the troops try to impose martial law, disarm innocent Texans, and detain them in tunnels beneath closed Walmart stores." Abbott told the Guard to monitor the exercise though far as we can tell, no troops were dispatched or activated. It’s also worth noting Abbott has said Texans’ safety and rights were not threatened by the federal maneuvers. On balance, we rate Bernie’s statement Half True.

pomt-01951	The IRS "also investigated liberal groups, groups that had progressive in their name. ... The IRS was basically looking at everybody."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/22/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-no-conspiracy-here-irs-targeted-libe/	A new twist in the Republican case against the Internal Revenue Service’s targeting of conservative groups reignited some old claims about the ongoing controversy on this week’s Sunday political shows. Last week, House Republicans grilled IRS Commissioner John Koskinen about emails belonging to former IRS executive Lois Lerner that the agency now says were destroyed when her computer hard drive crashed. Republicans were incensed and said IRS’ explanation didn’t pass the smell test. But during a debate June 22, 2014 on CNN’s State of the Union, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that the most recent Republican outrage is just a distraction. "The only lie here is to lie that I think conservatives are telling and saying that somehow another this was a conspiracy against conservatives," Brazile said. "(The IRS) also investigated liberal groups, groups that have progressive in their name, groups that had Israel in its name. So the IRS was basically looking at everybody because they were trying to figure out where all of this fake, phony, secretive money was flowing in the last election cycle." Brazile is echoing comments Democrats have made for a year. But is she right and the IRS was "basically looking at everybody"? This question was essentially answered last year by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, who investigated the IRS’s handling of tax exempt requests between 2010 and 2012. The controversy starts with an IRS office in Cincinnati, Ohio, that is in charge of reviewing applications for tax-exempt status. Their process includes determining whether the organization is involved in political activities and whether that should impact their tax-exempt status. For example, nonprofit organizations that identify as a 501(c)(4) can engage in "limited political campaign intervention," as long as its not their primary function, meaning, in part, that they can advocate for issues but not for candidates. In March 2010, this IRS office began looking at the tax exempt status of tea party groups. Ten tea party cases were identified and sent to a Washington office for greater scrutiny. IRS officials told investigators that "tea party" was used in the office as a catch-all phrase for groups engaging in political activity, and indeed not all 10 groups had "tea party" in their names. In August 2010, a formal "Be on the Lookout" list was created instructing staff to flag applications of tea party groups. In June 2011, the list was expanded to include the words "Patriot" and "9/12 project," a movement started by conservative talk radio host Glenn Beck, and applications with missions to "make America a better place to live," statements that criticized how the country is being run, or groups focused on government spending, debt or taxes. The investigation ultimately found the Cincinnati office used inappropriate criteria to single out certain cases. Over the course of two years, 298 total cases were sent to D.C. for greater scrutiny. According to the investigation, 72 of those groups had the name "tea party," 13 had "Patriot" and 11 had "9/12." The other 202 cases were listed as "other." In 160 of these cases, the application remained open between 206 and 1,138 days, while 108 were approved. Democrats said 202 is a lot of "other." And later it came out that the word "progressive" was also used to flag applications on another IRS "Be on the Lookout" list. Rep. Sandy Levin, D-Mich., the ranking member of the House Ways and Means committee asked Inspector General J. Russell George why he singled out all the mentions of conservative groups, but did not note in his investigation liberal groups were scrutinized as well. George replied that the investigation wasn’t only looking at which groups were flagged. Progressive groups were on a different lookout list that "did not include instructions on how to refer cases that met the criteria." However, the lookout list for tea party groups did, and also resulted in delayed processing and unnecessary questioning of those groups, such as inquiries into their donors. George also noted that while 16 groups with "progressive" in the name showed up among the 298 cases, that represented just 30 percent of all "progressive" applications. That is in stark contrast to groups with "tea party," "patriot," or "9/12" in their name, of which 100 percent saw their applications held up. Finally, George said his investigation found "multiple sources of information corroborating the use of tea party and other related criteria ... we found no indication in any of these other materials that ‘progressives’ was a term used to refer cases for scrutiny for political campaign intervention." So some progressive and liberal groups may have been flagged, and others may have ended up getting swept in the searches run by the Cincinnati office because their names had certain buzz words or phrases, but they didn’t get put through the ringer, at least on par with tea party groups. Our ruling Brazile said the IRS was "looking at everybody" including liberal groups and progressive groups. Yes, some progressive groups did have their tax-exempt status applications flagged as the IRS reviewed whether nonprofit groups were engaging in political activities. But it wasn’t to the same degree as tea party and other conservative groups, nor did it result in the same actions. The list targeting tea party groups resulted in delayed processing that in some cases lasted almost three years and inquiries into their donors. Further, the inspector general found tea party groups were systematically singled out as part of an office-wide effort, while progressive groups were not.

pomt-05780	Says Gov. Scott Walker is "openly" backing a move to abolish the state retirement system and convert it to a 401(k)-style plan that will reduce pensions "by at least a third" for current and retired public employees	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/27/chain-email/chain-email-says-gov-scott-walker-supports-move-ab/	Wisconsin public employees, already feeling bruised from past battles, now fear Gov. Scott Walker is planning to strip away their guaranteed pension benefits. A chain email that has rapidly been making the rounds among Democrats and public employees claims Walker is "openly" backing a move to abolish the Wisconsin Retirement System in favor of a system that will cut pensions. The retirement system has 430,000 members, including retired and active teachers, state and municipal employees. So that’s a lot of potential interest in the topic. We have received a dozen or more requests to check it out. Here are some of the key points from the chain email, including its tortured syntax: "Walker is saying that after he wins the recall election, he plans to push thru the legislature a plan to abolish the state retirement system and convert everyone to 401 K which will reduce our pensions by at least a third," the email says. "Tell everybody you know, included those already retired, because if Walker wins we are all in big trouble…. This is not a rumor, he is openly talking about it in Madison, it just isn't being publicized. Remember how nobody thought he would do anything to the union." The email is built around its own contradiction: Walker is "openly talking about it" yet "it just isn’t being publicized." It’s just one tack taken by those claiming Walker is out to gut the pension system. More than 32,000 people have signed a Move.On.org-sponsored online petition that opposes an alleged Walker plan to "radically alter" the retirement system. And the state teachers union is organizing a March 1, 2012 meeting on what it what it termed Walker’s plan to "seriously undermine" retirement security. "If you think that you are safe because you are retired, THINK AGAIN," says a flier from the Wisconsin Education Association Council. The concerns did not develop out of thin air. They date to early 2011, after Walker’s budget repair bill called for a study of the 401(k)-style concept. That study was later approved in the 2011-2012 budget. The budget calls for a study to be completed by June 30, 2012 of "establishing a defined contribution plan as an option for participating employees." "Defined contribution" refers to a 401(k)-style concept. (A second study topic is allowing employees to opt out of making contributions). The study comes after last year’s changes that required most public employees to contribute 5.8 percent of their pay toward their pension. Walker's administration, in response to the growing public profile of the issue, sent a letter to all WRS participants on Feb. 24, 2012 outlining the study's rationale. How does the pension system work? The current WRS is a modified version of a "defined benefit" system. It offers a guaranteed pension funded mostly from pooled investments in which risk is shared between the employer and the employees. Pension are based mainly on years of service and final salary. In contrast, under a "defined contribution" system, future benefits are not guaranteed at a specific level and workers bear the investment risk in an individual account. There’s actually precedent for this kind of system in Wisconsin: Before 1966, then-separate funds for teachers and state workers were of the defined-contribution type, according to a history done by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Experts told the Journal Sentinel at the time that Walker’s study, along with the governor’s ultimately successful move to eliminate of collective bargaining over pension changes, could herald an eventual conversion to a 401(k)-type plan. But the chain email makes a different, much bolder claim: That the decision to abolish the system has already been made and, indeed, Walker is "openly" backing such a move. In fact, little has been written or said about even what the study is looking at. We asked Mike Huebsch, secretary of the state Department of Administration, if the study would look at putting future hires into a 401(k)-style plan, as Michigan did. We also asked about "hybrid" systems, which combine the traditional guaranteed pension with a 401(k)- type program, such as in Indiana. And we asked if the study included a purely voluntary option where employees could choose to participate in a 401(k)-type program. Huebsch said all three approaches would be studied but "there is no intent at this point of forcing anybody into a system they wouldn’t want to be part of." He said he was aware of the outcry in other states when workers were forced into a 401(k)-style plan. "That’s why we would give them the option," Huebsch said. Walker recently commented on the study in an interview with WISC-TV in Madison, saying that alternatives would be evaluated according to "a balance of protecting hardworking taxpayers and providing whatever we might provide in a respectful and responsible way." Walker also said: "Despite all the hype and rumors out there, for people in the pension system right now, I can't anticipate anything in the future that wouldn't allow them to continue in that pension system if that's what they prefer to do." That contradicts the idea that Walker is openly touting elimination of the system. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie reiterated that Walker would await the study to determine if any changes needed to be made. No specific options are under active consideration, he said. Wisconsin already has a slight flavor of a defined-contribution plan, in that annual growth in retirees’ basic pension varies with state pension-fund earnings. Still, retirees are guaranteed a pension no lower than the level when they retired, unless they pick a high-risk option. Huebsch said that far from "abolishing" the retirement system, the goal is to determine how the Wisconsin system can remain stable and avoid the massive shortfalls facing other states’ pension funds. Experts say the Wisconsin pension fund is one of the healthiest in the United States, offers a relatively modest benefit and costs taxpayers less as a share of governmental spending than plans in nearly all other states. One of the email’s most provocative suggestions is that existing employees -- and even those already retired -- would see major benefit reductions. But legal experts say retirees almost certainly would be unaffected by any changes under discussion. Courts, they say, have consistently protected benefits already earned by retirees and current workers as a property right -- though governments are increasingly testing that principle. In contrast, judges have blessed changes that affect new hires who have never been under an existing system. Huebsch made clear how he viewed Wisconsin law: Changing any benefits already earned would be illegal. Could the state leave their previously accrued pension benefits in place but change them for future earnings? Some states, including Rhode Island, have required current employees to participate in "hybrid" pension plans that combine elements of both types of plans. Workers are suing over cuts in what they will receive. Wisconsin state statute 40.19 says "Rights exercised and benefits accrued to an employee under this chapter for service rendered shall be due as a contractual right and shall not be abrogated by any subsequent legislative act." But the statute also speaks of the state’s right to change benefits going forward. The state Employee Trust Funds department, which administers the pension fund, said in a statement on its website that any changes "could only apply to the accrual of future benefits." That leaves open changing benefits going forward for current employees. Our conclusion A chain email making the rounds claims Walker is "openly" backing a move to abolish the state retirement system. While a study of the system is under way, the email’s claim jumps the gun and goes way too far. We don’t yet know the study’s conclusions, and Walker’s administration says no decisions have been made on making any changes at all. What’s more, legal experts say in all likelihood any changes would have to be going forward -- and retirees have the most protection. We rate the email’s claim False.

pomt-08673	Scott Walker supported the same transportation bill he’s attacking me for. He said at the time it would save the taxpayers money.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/11/mark-neumann/mark-neumann-says-scott-walker-supported-1998-tran/	In the final days before the Sept. 14 primary, the Republican gubernatorial candidates are focused more on the past than the future -- chiefly, the 1998 federal transportation bill, Mark Neumann’s vote for it and what rival Scott Walker said about it at the time. It began with a Walker ad that faulted Neumann for voting for the pork-laden bill, which included the infamous "bridge to nowhere" in Alaska, and equating him with current Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two are hardly ideological soul mates, and we rated that connection False. Neumann struck back with his own ad. "Scott Walker claims I’m Nancy Pelosi?" Neumann says, speaking to the camera. "He must be kidding. The vote Scott Walker’s attacking me for, he supported too. The bill he calls pork today, he said would save the taxpayers money, back then." We’ll stop there for a closer look. As the pork line is read, an image of a June 15, 1998 letter to the editor that appeared in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel appears. It settles on and partially highlights in yellow this line: "In our opinion, supporting these projects is a better use of the funds and will ultimately save Milwaukee County taxpayers money." The letter is signed by Walker, then a member of the state Assembly representing Wauwatosa. Is it a smoking gun? The Walker letter came about three weeks after the May 22, 1998 vote in the U.S. House on the big road and transit bill. The letter makes it clear he and five other state lawmakers representing Milwaukee County backed a specific change in transportation funding made possible by a provision in the bill. That provision, inserted by U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, R-Fond du Lac, lifted a requirement that $241 million in federal money set aside for Milwaukee be used on either a light rail system or freeway bus and car-pool lanes in the East-West Corridor between Milwaukee and Waukesha. Walker, a longtime light-rail opponent, wanted the funds to go instead to freeway reconstruction in Milwaukee, including the Marquette Interchange, and the county bus system. He has long opposed light rail as a waste of taxpayer money, too costly to build and likely to lead to long-term government subsidies. So, at issue now is what Walker was pointing to in the "money saving" statement highlighted in the Neumann ad. Was Walker talking about the full bill with its $9 billion in pork, or the provision that moved money from light rail to other purposes? And, by supporting that piece of the bill, was Walker supporting the entire bill? Start with the money savings. In addition to the letter in the TV ad, the Neumann campaign also cited a May 30, 1998 Journal Sentinel story quoting from a letter that Walker and the five other state lawmakers sent to then-Gov. Tommy Thompson the day before. In the letter to Thompson, Walker and the others are clearly focused on the Petri provision. "We believe the taxpayers of Milwaukee County will benefit from not being forced to use these transportation funds" on a light rail system or special freeway lanes, the letter read. Walker certainly did not say the entire bill would save taxpayers money. The provision in question did not increase funding. The $241 million in question had been appropriated seven years earlier and was sitting unspent. The Neumann campaign has not pointed to any statement of support by Walker for the full bill but notes that in legislative bodies you either vote up or down on a measure; in the end, you don’t get to pick and choose pieces of it. Ironically, that’s what Neumann complained about in the wake of the first ad -- he didn’t like the pork but supported the bill because of other policy aspects, especially because it prevented the siphoning off of federal gas tax proceeds for non-transportation purposes. So what about the central statement by Neumann? He’s not totally off base. Walker’s only public comments were actually in favor of one provision in the bill. Walker did not qualify his remarks to suggest he liked the Petri provision but was against the whole bill. We could find no record of Walker opposing the full bill or the $9 billion in pork. But by pairing the highlighted words from Walker’s letter with Neumann’s narration, it leaves viewers with the impression that the words refer to support for the full bill. They do not. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06961	"The clear majority of Republican voters think that any deficit reduction package should have a balanced approach and should include some revenues."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-clear-majority-republican-voters/	As President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress continued their high-stakes stand-off over raising the debt ceiling and other federal budget issues, Obama held a press conference to press his case that he's a reasonable guy. One of the main points of contention is whether an agreement should include tax increases of any kind, such as closing tax loopholes or tax increases on the wealthy. Republicans oppose raising taxes. "My Republican friends have said that they’re not willing to do revenues, and they have repeated that on several occasions," Obama said. "My hope, though, is that they’re listening, not just to lobbyists or special interests here in Washington, but they’re also listening to the American people. Because it turns out poll after poll, many done by your organizations, show that it’s not just Democrats who think we need to take a balanced approach; it’s Republicans as well. The clear majority of Republican voters think that any deficit reduction package should have a balanced approach and should include some revenues. That’s not just Democrats; that’s the majority of Republicans." Obama also said that most polls show the general public thinks a balanced approach is right, and we explored those polls in detail in a separate fact-check. But was he right that a "clear majority" of Republicans also agreed? We found three recent polls with information on responses by partisan affiliation. The poll that most supported Obama's statement was a Gallup poll conducted July 7-10, 2011, which posed the question this way: "As you may know, Congress can reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting spending, raising taxes, or a combination of the two. Ideally, how would you prefer to see Congress attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit: only with spending cuts, mostly with spending cuts, equally with spending cuts and tax increases, mostly with tax increases, or only with tax increases?" The answer "only spending cuts" got 26 percent from self-identified Republicans. The other answers from Republicans were "mostly spending cuts," 41 percent; "equal spending cuts and tax increases," 24 percent. Another 3 percent favored "mostly" or "only" tax increases. So here, about 68 percent of Republicans were open to some tax increases. But a Quinnipiac University poll conducted July 5-11, 2011, found slightly more Republicans favored only spending cuts, contradicting Obama's statement. It asked, "Do you think any agreement to raise the national debt ceiling should include only spending cuts, or should it also include an increase in taxes for the wealthy and corporations?" In this case, 48 percent of Republicans favored spending cuts only, while 43 percent favored including tax increases. Another 9 percent were unsure. In June, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found Republicans essentially split on the question. In that poll, 43 percent of Republicans said cut existing programs, while 44 percent favored including tax increases. That result was within the margin of error. In conclusion, we don't find that "poll after poll" showed a "clear majority" of Republicans supporting tax increases. We found one recent poll that supported Obama's statement and two other polls that showed a much more evenly divided picture. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06665	"Over the past 10 years, the number of people living in Lower Manhattan has nearly doubled. In fact, Lower Manhattan has added more people over the last 10 years than Atlanta, Dallas and Philadelphia combined."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/11/michael-bloomberg/new-york-city-mayor-mike-bloomberg-claims-populati/	The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 may have forever changed the landscape of Lower Manhattan, but they didn’t stop more and more people from calling the area home. Ten years since that fateful day, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has a statistic to prove it: the population of Lower Manhattan has nearly doubled, surpassing the combined growth in three major American cities. "Over the past 10 years, the number of people living in Lower Manhattan has nearly doubled," Bloomberg said during a Sept. 6 speech. "In fact, Lower Manhattan has added more people over the last 10 years than Atlanta, Dallas and Philadelphia combined. In 2001, no one could have believed that that would happen." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Bloomberg’s numbers are accurate. Based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, most of the area below Canal Street saw a net population increase of 26,870 between 2000 and 2010. The population in that area last year was 59,316 -- an increase of nearly 83 percent. Atlanta, Dallas and Philadelphia saw population increases during the same time period of 3,529, 9,236 and 8,456, respectively, according to census data. That’s a combined total of 21,221. Let’s explain how Bloomberg defines "Lower Manhattan" to reach his population estimate. To back up the mayor’s point, Bloomberg spokesman Andrew Brent sent us a chart prepared by the city’s Department of City Planning. That chart breaks down population changes in 12 "census tracts" representing the area south of Canal Street, west of Centre Street and south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The changes in those census tracts totaled 26,870 new residents between 2000 and 2010. Canal Street is widely considered a dividing line between Lower Manhattan and the rest of the borough. However, we also found a separate analysis by the Department of City Planning that claims a smaller population increase of 19,611 for an area defined as "Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan." Comprised of seven census tracts, that smaller area excludes several northern blocks closer to Canal Street. Still, that analysis cautions that "(Neighborhood Tabulation Area) boundaries and their associated names may not definitively represent neighborhoods." Jovana Rizzo, a City Planning spokeswoman, further confirmed in an email that the "26,870 number is the more appropriate reflection of Lower Manhattan (south of Canal St)." So Bloomberg’s figure of 26,870 new residents in Lower Manhattan is correct. Now, let’s talk about why people have moved there. Even before Sept. 11, Lower Manhattan was being transformed into more of a residential community. Office space in the financial district was being converted for residential use, industrial lofts in Tribeca were being revamped and new construction was under way in Battery Park City, according to Sharon Zukin, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College. Drawn by housing prices, waterfront access and other amenities, people were carving out a residential community where none existed before, Zukin said. "They became emotionally attached to living in Lower Manhattan," said Zukin, referring to the existing residents on Sept. 11. More residents came to Lower Manhattan as housing prices dipped in the years following Sept. 11, said Pace University professor Farrokh Hormozi, who once helped prepare a formerly ongoing university report on economic activity in Lower Manhattan. After the transformation began around 2004, the level of economic activity surpassed its pre-Sept. 11 levels by 2007, Hormozi said. "It is a very interesting part of the City of New York," Hormozi said. "It has something to offer and people are taking advantage of that." The population increase in Lower Manhattan also coincided with "a development boom that was fueled by two public incentive programs," including the availability of $1.6 billion in federal funding between 2001 and 2005, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York. These days, the residential vacancy rate sits at 0.7 percent, according to the Alliance. Our ruling Nearing the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Bloomberg claimed the population in Lower Manhattan has nearly doubled, exceeding the combined growth in Atlanta, Dallas and Philadelphia. Census data backs up his statement. Many people not only paid more attention to Lower Manhattan in the years following Sept. 11. They moved there. We rate the statement True.

pomt-04003	"This is the first time since Roe was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn."	false	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/08/dan-becker/abortion-foe-overreaches-describing-context-court-/	Last month the Alabama Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision. Essentially, the court ruled that a guilty plea for child endangerment entered by a Colbert County mother should stand. Amanda Kimbrough initially entered the guilty plea after her son Timmy died 19 minutes after birth at 25 weeks in April 2008. A medical examiner determined that Timmy died from "acute methamphetamine intoxication." After Kimbrough pleaded guilty to charges under Alabama’s chemical endangerment of a child statute, she received the minimum sentence of 10 years. Kimbrough later appealed, saying the chemical endangerment statute did not extend to unborn children. The Alabama ruling included acknowledgment of unborn children in the state’s chemical endangerment statute. Anti-abortion advocates immediately praised the decision as a victory for "personhood rights of preborn children." "This is the first time since Roe (v. Wade) was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn," Dan Becker, the president of Georgia Right to Life, said in a news release a few days after the Jan. 11 ruling. "I am greatly encouraged that Georgia, which has proven to be pro-life, will now grant the same protection to our innocent children." The personhood issue -- defining human life with full rights at the point of conception instead of birth -- has had a long history in this country’s abortion debate. Abortion opponents in several states have pursued personhood efforts since the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion case. So, we wondered: Could the Alabama ruling be a precedent as Becker said? Kimbrough, the Alabama mother, admitted smoking methamphetamine three days before her child was born, according to media reports. Alabama’s chemical endangerment code prohibits a "responsible person" from "exposing a child to an environment in which (the person) … knowingly, recklessly, or intentionally causes or permits a child to be exposed to, to ingest or inhale, or to have contact with a controlled substance, chemical substance, or drug paraphernalia." In the case of a child’s death due to these circumstances, the result is a Class A felony with a minimum prison term of 10 years. A Georgia Right to Life spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that the organization was not aware of a similar court ruling prior to the Alabama case. "The tide is turning. More and more people are rejecting the culture of death that has existed for far too long," spokeswoman Suzanne Ward said in an email. Personhood USA, a Denver-based organization that opposes abortion, supported Becker’s claim. "The only personhood effort state-by-state (Virginia and Mississippi, for example) that has been done is through Personhood USA, and we haven’t gotten anything to pass yet. So right now there are no personhood laws on the books in any state," said Jennifer Mason, Personhood’s communications director. The Alabama decision centered on a chemical endangerment statute. But the court "said women should not take these drugs knowing that they could endanger the child. So it was both a chemical endangerment decision, but also an affirmation of personhood rights for those babies as well," Mason said. PolitiFact Georgia put the claim to B. Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Law School. Hill disagreed with Becker’s statement and cited several other cases, including some cited in the Alabama ruling, in which courts have granted personhood status to the preborn. Among them, a 1997 criminal child neglect case in South Carolina involving an expectant mother sentenced to eight years in prison after her child was born with the drug in its system. "It’s not that uncommon (among courts)," Hill said. "Various states have said a fetus could be a child under specific statutes, like criminal child neglect, wrongful death or, in the Alabama case, chemical endangerment." Steve Crampton, general counsel for Liberty Counsel, which has partnered with Personhood USA on litigation and has worked with Georgia Right to Life, said the Alabama decision "has great potential application" outside the chemical endangerment statute. What happens next with the Alabama ruling is unknown, said Paul Horwitz, a constitutional law professor at the University of Alabama. "I just don’t think it’s a question of a court using the word ‘personhood.’ It’s a question of whether or not there is a right to an abortion and when," he said. "I don’t see that larger constitutional issue as something that is automatically teed up in a useful way because of this court’s ruling." So was Georgia Right to Life President Dan Becker correct in saying that an Alabama Supreme Court case last month was "the first time since Roe was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn"? Not really. There have been other cases in other states in the 40 years since Roe v. Wade in which courts have decided that a fetus could be a child. Those cases dealt with specific statutes, including criminal child neglect and wrongful death, which were similar to the Alabama case involving a chemical endangerment statute. But there is no general ruling saying a fetus is a person or granting personhood status to the preborn in all circumstances, according to constitutional and reproductive law experts. Becker claimed that no other court had made personhood rulings, but our research found that that is not the case. We rated Becker’s claim False.

pomt-15067	Missouri is "#1 in the nation for holding down tuition increases at public universities."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2015/sep/24/jay-nixon/jay-nixon-says-missouri-no-1-nation-holding-down-t/	In August, Gov. Jay Nixon visited colleges throughout the state to announce that the schools would be receiving funding for renovations and improvements to their campuses, as part of Missouri’s Building Affordability initiative. The initiative aims to invest $200 million in higher education in the state as a means of reducing tuition hikes. As part of the promotion for this initiative, Nixon tweeted on Aug. 12 "#BuildingAffordability will help ensure #MO remains #1 in the nation for holding down tuition increases at public universities" Nixon made a similar statement during an Aug. 24 appearance at Southeast Missouri State University. Samantha Rinehart of the Southeast Missourian reported that Nixon said "Missouri has held down tuition costs in its public four-year institutions to the lowest level in the nation." Missouri is the nation’s leader in holding back tuition increases? We were curious to see if this was the case. We contacted the governor's press secretary, Scott Holste, to find out where Nixon was getting his information. Holste cited a study called Trends in College Pricing published by the College Board, a not-for-profit organization that, among other things, conducts research on college institutions. Holste also provided us with a spreadsheet of data from the study supporting the governor's assertion. The percentile change of the average in-state tuition and fees for public four-year institutions between the 2008-09 school year and the 2014-15 school year was only 7.08 percent. That’s indeed best in the nation. Maine was in second place. We pulled our own copy of the College Board's data from their website to verify the governor's information. It checks out. Here’s the top 10, by percentage. Rank State Tuition increase between 2008-09 and 2014-15 school years (by pct.) 10 Nebraska 14.77% 9 North Dakota 13.59% 8 Oklahoma 12.84% 7 Iowa 12.76% 6 New Jersey 11.69% 5 Ohio 10.04% 4 Maryland 8.96% 3 Montana 8.64% 2 Maine 7.69% 1 Missouri 7.08% Source: The College Board There are a few caveats worth noting. 1. The College Board data for the six years cited by the governor show that among states, districts and territories included in the data, Puerto Rico has kept tuition increases in check more than Missouri, with a change of 4.7 percent. However, among the 50 states, Missouri is the leader. 2. Judging purely by tuition hikes fails to show the complete picture. For the 2014-15 semester, College Board reported that in-state tuition and fees at public four-year institutions in Missouri averaged $8,383. If we were ranking the states from lowest average tuition to highest, Missouri would rank 22nd in the country. Louisiana, for instance, has had sharper tuition increases than many of its peers in recent years. But it still has a lower average tuition than Missouri. Looking at the average cost of tuition puts Missouri in a different light. Sandy Baum, co-author of the College Board study and professor at George Washington University, noted that while the scale of time may be arbitrary, Missouri is still doing quite well as far as tuition hikes are concerned. Over the last 10 years, the tuition average for Missouri has only increased 12.31 percent, while the national average for tuition increases over the last 10 years is nearly 42 percent. Our ruling Nixon tweeted that Missouri is "#1 in the nation for holding down tuition increases at public universities." When looking at the period between 2008-09 and today, Nixon is accurate, College Board information shows. But that doesn’t mean tuition is cheap in Missouri. The state ranks 22nd in its tuition rate. Nixon’s statement lacks that caveat. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Jay Nixon	None	None	None	2015-09-24T13:22:52	2015-08-12	['None']

Sarah Palin posted excerpts from a speech she gave in Norfolk, Va., primarily on national security. At one point, she said, "We spend three times more on entitlements and debt services than we do on defense." We thought we'd check her math. (We also checked another statement from the same post, that the U.S. "only ranks 25th worldwide on defense spending as a percentage of GDP." We gave that one a Barely True. Let's preface this discussion by noting that federal budgeting involves extremely arcane categories and that various measures can be plausible yardsticks in analyzing this question. The one we chose was the baseline projection included in the president's fiscal year 2011 budget proposal. (That's Table S-3 for budget nerds.) The figure for fiscal year 2009 -- the last complete fiscal year -- shows the following breakdown: • Appropriated security programs: $782 billion • Mandatory programs (includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, among other programs): $2.112 trillion • Net interest: $187 billion If you add together mandatory programs and the net interest, then divide that by the amount spent on security programs, the ratio is 2.93 -- very close to the "three times more" that Palin cites. Here are some caveats. The appropriated security programs category includes the nuclear weapons portion of the Energy Department, the Department of Homeland Security, portions of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of State and other international programs. Defense programs account for about 80 percent of the total, but not the entire amount. Meanwhile, if you total up the budget for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- the three big entitlements most familiar to Americans -- it accounts for about two-thirds of the budget for mandatory programs. The "other mandatory programs" category includes such things as veterans' benefits. Despite these distinctions, we think it's reasonable for Palin to describe all security programs as "defense" and all mandatory programs as "entitlements." In all, then, we rate this comment by Palin much more favorably than we do her other comment from the same speech. This one earns a rating of True.

pomt-14680	"I didn’t support Sonia Sotomayor."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/15/chris-christie/marco-rubio-says-chris-christie-supported-sonia-so/	Marco Rubio tried to cast fellow GOP presidential candidate Chris Christie as a liberal on many topics, including the appointment of Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor. During the South Carolina debate Jan. 14, Rubio said that Christie endorsed many of the ideas that President Barack Obama supports, "whether it is Common Core, or gun control, or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor, or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood." Christie shot back, "Let’s get the facts straight. First of all, I didn’t support Sonia Sotomayor." He then continued to dispute the rest of Rubio’s statement. We decided to focus on the part about the Supreme Court justice. Who is right? Did Christie support Sotomayor or not? Sotomayor Sotomayor, a U.S. Court of Appeals judge, was Obama’s first Supreme Court nominee and the country’s first Hispanic justice. She was confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 6, 2009, in a 68-31 vote. The Rubio campaign did not respond to our inquiry about the claim, but we tracked down some of Christie’s statements through his campaign and news coverage. In 2009, Christie was running for governor in New Jersey, so he didn’t get to vote on her appointment or play any role in her vetting by the Senate. But he did make a series of statements about her in 2009 that a Christie campaign spokeswoman sent to us. It’s not surprising that Christie -- a former federal prosecutor -- was asked to weigh in about a Supreme Court candidate who was from New York and went to college at Princeton in New Jersey. In a radio debate May 27, 2009, Christie was asked: "Would you have appointed her or even considered her for a top appointment to the bench?" Christie responded, "She wouldn’t have been my choice, no." When asked to elaborate, Christie said, "Well, no, I mean listen, that’s the question. She wouldn’t have been my choice. Absolutely not. Not my kind of judge. " But two months later, he made comments that showed some support for her confirmation -- although he again said that Sotomayor would not have been his choice. "After watching and listening to Judge Sotomayor's performance at the confirmation hearings this week, I am confident that she is qualified for the position of associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court," said Christie, a former federal prosecutor, according to Politicker New Jersey. "Elections have consequences. One of those consequences are judicial appointments. While Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice, President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability, competence and ability." He continued: "I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination. Qualified appointees should be confirmed and deserve bipartisan support. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito deserved that support based on their work as Circuit Court Judges. So does Judge Sotomayor. As a result, I support her confirmation. This is a historic moment and her inspiring success story should not only make the Latino community proud, but all Americans." Our ruling Christie said, "I didn’t support Sonia Sotomayor." When Sotomayor was nominated by Obama, Christie said in May 2009, "She wouldn’t have been my choice, no." But two months later, Christie said that she had "more than proven her capability, competence and ability," adding, "I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination." Christie’s statement that he didn’t support Sotomayor misrepresents his eventual position.

pomt-05281	"For every one mile of light-rail track that will be built, 16 miles of new road capacity will be built."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/25/colleen-kiernan/group-says-georgia-transportation-plan-needs-more/	One main criticism about the proposed list of projects aimed at improving transportation throughout the Atlanta region is it doesn’t have enough new rail components. In south DeKalb County, some county commissioners and influential leaders have been reluctant to support a 1 percent sales tax to fund the projects because the plan doesn’t extend MARTA rail service to the area. The environmentally conscious Georgia Sierra Club went a step further recently when it announced its opposition to the July 31 referendum on the tax. One claim the organization’s director made as part of her argument against the referendum seemed worthy of a fact-check. "For every one mile of light-rail track that will be built, 16 miles of new road capacity will be built," Colleen Kiernan said in a radio interview with WABE-FM’s Denis O’Hayer. Hmmm. Is that correct? Let’s take a ride in search of the truth. The list for the 10-county Atlanta region contains 157 projects, according to the Atlanta Regional Commission, which provided data and analysis to officials involved in putting together the list. The Sierra Club sent PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet with about 70 projects that would increase the number of lanes of some roads or make them longer. Some of the road projects on the list include: Interchange improvements at Ga. 400 and I-285 at the top end of the Perimeter district. A "super arterial" road along a portion of Tara Boulevard in Clayton County. Widening and other improvements along Buford Highway from Old Peachtree Road to Sugarloaf Parkway in Gwinnett County. Interchange improvements at I-285 and Cascade Road in southwest Atlanta. The road projects would increase capacity by 367 miles, ARC says. By comparison, there are three confirmed light-rail projects on the list: along the Atlanta Beltline, the Atlanta streetcar and a line on Clifton Corridor from the Lindbergh Center in Atlanta to Emory University in DeKalb County. A proposed rail line from Cobb County to Midtown Atlanta would need federal funding and is not currently considered a light-rail project. The referendum’s supporters say the lack of light or heavy rail in the plan is not a lack of will, but a matter of math. The light rail on the Beltline and Clifton Corridor is expected to cost about $1.3 billion, or about $60 million a mile. The referendum is projected to raise about $8.5 billion over the life span of the tax, 10 years. Jane Hayse, ARC’s transportation division chief, said the light-rail projects are 21 miles combined. So what about the Sierra Club’s calculation of a 16-to-1 ratio of road projects to light rail? According to ARC, there are 17.5 miles of increased road capacity in the plan for each mile of proposed light rail. "Mathematically, it is accurate," Hayse told us. "However, the comparison is erroneous. It compares apples to bananas." Hayse said in order to fairly fact-check the Sierra Club’s claim, you must consider all the additional bus projects in the plan. The list includes express bus service in portions of the region and $100 million for bus service in Clayton County, which ended its bus operations a few years ago due to budget cuts. In all, ARC said there is an additional 371 miles of bus service on the list. ARC spokesman Jim Jaquish said the organization will not take a position on the referendum because it is a nonprofit that receives taxpayer dollars. Jaquish did say ARC believes the list is made up of "sound, needed projects." Hayse said express bus service is more logical for some parts of the Atlanta suburbs because people do not live and work as closely together as they do in the city. Hayse said rail stations are typically three miles apart, whereas express bus service has longer distances between stops. "Light rail just doesn’t make sense for the whole region," she said. Kiernan countered that bus service is not a sure thing, noting that Clayton County’s bus service, C-Tran, was discontinued. "Our argument is that the amount of fixed, permanent transit infrastructure that we know will be built by the tax is overwhelmed by the amount of fixed road infrastructure we know will be built," Kiernan wrote via email. "Traditional express and local bus service is a completely different animal ... and the suggestion that ‘miles of bus service’ is somehow equivalent to miles of permanent fixed-guideway infrastructure is highly misleading." Kiernan’s claim is essentially correct. But it needs a bit of context to move higher on the Truth-O-Meter. Under our rating system, Kiernan gets a Mostly True.

pomt-15384	Polls indicate that "white people think that black people are less intelligent. They think they’re less trustworthy, less patriotic."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/29/juan-williams/juan-williams-whites-think-blacks-are-less-intelli/	Fox News' Juan Williams made an interesting claim about the continued existence of racism in the wake of the Charleston, S.C, shootings. "The polls indicate this, that white people think that black people are less intelligent," Williams said on the June 22, 2015, edition of The Five. "They think they’re less trustworthy, less patriotic. At some point you’ve got to deal with these root issues." We reached out to Williams to better understand his statement but did not hear back. We think you could interpret his words two ways. You might think that a majority of white people believe black people are less intelligent, trustworthy and patriotic. Or you could hear Williams' claim and think that within the white population, you’re more likely to find people who think poorly of blacks. You could have that trend even if most whites don’t think that way. The difference in interpretation makes all the difference, polls show. What the polls show about race To make sense of racial attitudes, pollsters ask whites and blacks the same set of questions about their own group and the other group. Then they compare the results. A 2012 survey from a partnership of the Associated Press, the GfK polling firm, Stanford University, the National Center for Opinion Research (NORC) and the University of Michigan attempted to answer questions about how one race thought of the other. The series of questions followed the pattern of, "How well does each of these words describe most blacks/whites?" Words included "intelligent at school," "smart at everyday things," "law abiding," "good neighbors" and "dependable." The possible responses were Extremely well, Very well, Moderately well, Slightly well and Not at all well. Josh Pasek, a researcher at the University of Michigan who worked on the project, broke down the results for us to help analyze Williams' claim. "Intelligent at school" and "smart at everyday things" are approximations for intelligence. "Law abiding," "good neighbors" and "dependable" work as stand-ins for trustworthy. (Alas, the survey did not ask about patriotism.) This approach lets you tease out how many whites have negative opinions of whites, and how many whites have negative opinions of blacks. And you can compare that to black perspectives on whites and blacks. The results: A majority of whites don't hold negative views of blacks. But you will find a group of whites who view blacks more harshly than whites. And that group is bigger than the fraction of blacks who see blacks negatively. The following chart shows the negative opinions of whites. The green bar is the percentage of whites holding a negative opinion of blacks. The brown bar is the percentage of whites holding negative views of other whites. The higher the column, the more negative the feeling. The clear pattern is that whites are more likely to have a negative view of blacks than of whites. To round out the picture, the fraction of blacks who hold negative views of blacks is about half that of whites. Additional study results We looked at other studies in this area, including one that looked at people's views on patriotism. Intelligence. A group of researchers led by Harvard University sociologist Lawrence Bobo looked at recent trends in white attitudes about blacks. That research shows that since 1990, the fraction of whites who think that whites are more intelligent and more hardworking than blacks has declined. Tom Smith, director of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center (NORC), told us that "racial differences have decreased over time, but many whites still rate blacks more negatively than they rate whites on various traits." Smith said in the 2014 survey, one quarter of whites rated blacks as less intelligent than whites. Trustworthy. Angie Maxwell, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas, told us that the 2012 Blair Center national poll found that about a fifth of whites (20 percent) say that blacks are untrustworthy. Generally negative views. Vincent Hutchings at the University of Michigan pulled responses from the American National Election Study to assess the impact of race on the 2008 election of Barack Obama. Hutchings didn’t report how whites answered specific questions but he wrote that overall, a "slight majority of Latinos and Whites indicate that they view Blacks more negatively than they do Whites." Patriotism. Spencer Piston, a political scientist at Syracuse University, directed us to the American National Election Study, which added patriotism to its questionnaire. Piston ran the numbers for us and found that for whites: 46 percent rate blacks less patriotic than they rate whites; 49 percent rate blacks equally patriotic to how they rate whites; 5 percent rate blacks more patriotic than they rate whites. A final note The connection between these survey results and overt racism is far from straightforward. Pasek at the University of Michigan said the connection between outcomes is even more complex. "If you look at the series of recent incidents, from Trayvon Martin to Ferguson, Mo., those are not necessarily cases where people would have actively espoused racist attitudes," Pasek said. "But there could be an internal racial predisposition that would lead them to act in prejudicial ways, and social science suggests that most of us harbor these implicit biases." Our ruling Williams said polls show that white people think that black people are less intelligent, less trustworthy and less patriotic. The veracity of Williams' claim hinges on how you interpret his comments. One way: That whites are more likely to hold negative opinions of blacks (than they do of fellow whites or blacks do of blacks), is largely accurate. But a second way: That a majority of whites hold negative opinions of blacks, is inaccurate. On the question of patriotism, the data are thin. But what we have suggests that Williams is wrong. Williams’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Juan Williams	None	None	None	2015-06-29T12:54:54	2015-06-22	['None']

pomt-13964	"More than 32,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/jun/14/safety-all-initiative/mostly-true-california-initiatives-claim-guns-kill/	Calls to strengthen California’s gun laws intensified this week after the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in history at an Orlando nightclub. State lawmakers described the tragedy as a call to action to strengthen California’s firearm regulations, considered among the toughest in America. In November, voters in the state will likely be asked to make those laws even tougher, by approving the Safety For All Initiative. That measure is led by Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and is pending signature verification. On the initiative’s website, it claims: "More than 32,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year." The statement is followed by the message: "Gun Violence Is Not Inevitable. The Power To Save Lives Is In Our Hands: Together We Can Keep Our Communities Safe." We wondered about the eye-popping 32,000 figure and whether any context was missing. A screenshot of SafetyForAll.com's homepage shows the claim about 32,000 Americans losing their lives to gun violence each year. Our research Much of the Safety For All Initiative is designed to make it more difficult for individuals to obtain ammunition for assault-style weapons, such as those used in recent mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando. Here’s what the measure would do, if approved by voters: Require instant background checks for ammunition purchases; strengthen checks for gun purchases and ban the possession of large, detachable military-style magazines; and require the immediate surrender of firearms for people convicted of serious and violent crimes. A spokeswoman for the initiative pointed us to figures from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention. They show nearly 33,000 gun deaths, on average, from 2010 through 2014 in the United States. Of those, more than 62 percent resulted from suicides by guns -- something not mentioned on the Safety For All website. There’s no mention of suicide by guns or suicide prevention efforts in the text of the measure, either. About 34 percent of the gun deaths are from homicides. The remaining four percent resulted from accidents, legal intervention or cases where intent was undetermined. We asked the initiative campaign about the large share of gun deaths from suicide. Dan Newman, a campaign strategist for the lieutenant governor, replied that "treating ammo sales like guns and screening for dangerous mental illness, taking guns away from people legally prohibited from owning weapons, reporting lost and stolen guns and ammo – these will all reduce gun violence of all kinds, from suicide to mass murder." In October 2015, PolitiFact Texas checked a similar claim by Hillary Clinton, that "We lose an average of 90 Americans every day because of guns." That adds up to the CDC total of more than 32,000. They rated it Mostly True. PolitiFact Texas pointed out that at least once, Clinton has clarified her figure by mentioning suicides; according to a post on her campaign website, she said: "We lose between 88 and 92 Americans a day from gun violence — homicides, suicides and accidents — and we have to act." Our ruling The Safety For All Initiative proposes stronger gun and ammunition restrictions in California. On its website, it says "More than 32,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year." That sad statistic checks out, based on an examination of data from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention. While the statement is accurate, it needs a key clarification that more than 60 percent of those gun deaths result from suicides. Much of the Safety For All Initiative is designed to make it more difficult for individuals to obtain ammunition for assault-style weapons, not typically associated with suicides. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

In fact, the stacks would be pretty lopsided. Tancredo is wrong to suggest that climate scientists are evenly split. The overwhelming consensus among them is that humans are the main cause of global warming. A recent study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists from more than 130 nations, concluded that there is overwhelming evidence that warming is caused by human activity. Their February 2007 report said warming was "unequivocal" and that most of it has been caused by greenhouse gas concentrations caused by humans. The report said that humans have caused a significant increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide since 1750. Yes, there have been dissenting studies over the years about global warming. But the IPCC is an effort to forge an international consensus. It has included more than 2,500 expert reviewers, more than 800 authors and more than 450 lead authors working for the past six years.

pomt-14771	"In France, they have a (surveillance) program a thousandfold more invasive" than the United States.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/08/rand-paul/rand-paul-largely-correct-french-electronic-survei/	Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul argued against excessive surveillance and the bulk collection of electronic communication data, saying the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., show it isn’t successful. "The Paris tragedy ... happened while we were still doing bulk collection," Paul said on the Dec. 6, 2015, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press. "All bulk collection. Also in France, they have a program a thousandfold more invasive collecting all of the data of all the French. Yet they still weren't able to see this coming." We wanted to gauge whether the French system is far more invasive than the one in the United States. Mass surveillance 101 The key U.S. surveillance laws include the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, passed in 1978, and the USA Patriot Act, which was passed in 2002 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Portions of these laws have been variously reauthorized and revised, but the most relevant parts for analyzing Paul’s claim have to do with two broad topics: the process for eavesdropping on specific targets, and the collection of "bulk" metadata, which is information about the timing and frequency of electronic communications but not the content. France had already been engaged in bulk data collection on a scale similar to or even more expansive than the United States, according a 2013 report by leading French newspaper Le Monde. But this year -- between the Jan. 7 terrorist attack on magazine Charlie Hebdo and the Nov. 13 attacks across Paris -- France clarified its policy with the passage of a new law on surveillance. The controversial law was initially passed in June and upheld in August by France’s Constitutional Council with some limited revisions. Where the two countries’ surveillance programs are similar The French approach mirrors that of the U.S. approach in several ways. The French law requires Internet and telecommunications companies to install "black boxes" that vacuum up raw data about users that can be searched by computerized algorithm. This is broadly similar to the once-secret data-collection program known as PRISM, which came to light due to revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden. (The current status of the bulk data collection program is somewhat murky; authorization for bulk data collection expired on June 1, 2015, and then was extended by lawmakers for six months on an interim basis to facilitate transition to a new system. That period has just ended.) In addition, French law enforcement can seek permission to eavesdrop on specific targets, and that means that people who interact with those approved targets can have their communications scrutinized in that process as well, whether or not they themselves are suspected of being involved in illegal activities. This mechanism is broadly similar to the one in the United States. And French law enforcement, like U.S. law enforcement, has the ability under the law to conduct "warrantless" wiretaps that sidestep prior judicial approval, at least in some cases. Finally, critics of both countries’ laws have said they both contain inadequate provisions for transparency and whistleblower activities. Snowden has previously said that weak whistleblower protections helped convince him to go public about the National Security Agency’s activities rather than following official protest channels. These similarities aside, there are at least five ways in which France’s system is arguably more muscular than the one in the United States. Where the French system goes further than the United States’ system • Judicial review. Under the United States’ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, law enforcement officials must go to a special judicial court to receive permission to conduct electronic surveillance of American citizens. Historically, law enforcement officials have generally gotten what they’ve wanted from the court, leading critics to question how much of a hurdle this is. Still, the fact that members of the judiciary are passing judgment on the government’s requests does provide at least a modicum of independent oversight. By contrast, under the French system’s analogous body, only a minority of members of the National Commission for the Control of Intelligence Techniques -- six of 13 -- are judges. Another six are legislators and the last is a technical expert. The panel can be overruled by the prime minister. "Because there is no opportunity for independent and neutral judges to decide whether surveillance of a particular target is justified (in the French system), there is a heightened risk that government officials might engage in improper monitoring," wrote Nathan A. Sales, a Syracuse University law professor in an analysis commissioned by the bar association of Paris while the law was being debated. Sales held senior positions in the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush and was involved in the drafting of the Patriot Act. • Lack of "minimization." The United States’ system takes steps, albeit imperfect ones, to focus intelligence collection on suspicious behavior, thereby "minimizing" the amount of unrelated data swept up. These can involve restricting who can see the information, how long it may be retained, and whether or how it can be disseminated, Sales wrote. By contrast, the French system has few if any such protections, Sales wrote. He suggested an area of particular concern is a "lack (of) any limits on the monitoring of privileged communications between attorneys and their clients." • Search and seizure. One of the more contentious parts of the Patriot Act has involved delayed-notification searches -- that is, searches of properties in which the target not only isn’t present but is not even notified about the search until well after it takes place. These are sometimes called "sneak and peek" searches, or "sneak and steal" when it involves seizing and removing items from the location. These types of searches existed before the Patriot Act, but their use was tightly constrained; the Patriot Act loosened the rules. The French system, meanwhile, permits even more expansive action for tracking data and communications during such searches than the United States does, critics say. Under the French law, bugs, cameras and keystroke loggers could be planted during such searches, according to multiple media reports. • Location-based surveillance. The French law allows the use of devices variously known as "proximity sensors," "cell site simulators," "IMSI catchers" or "Stingrays." Rather than targeting surveillance on a specific person, these devices allow surveillance of cellphone calls and text messages at a given location. Privacy advocates say this technology is likely to capture communications by uninvolved bystanders. In the United States, it is Justice Department policy to seek a FISA probable-cause warrant before using such techniques. On paper, at least, that appears to be a tougher hurdle than what the French law includes. • Going beyond terrorism. The Patriot Act includes terrorism in its title (it’s the final "t" in the acronym "patriot"), and at the FISA court, the government must show that the target is an "agent of a foreign power," which has generally been interpreted to mean a spy or a terrorist. By contrast, the French law includes some broader justifications for action, including protecting France’s "economic, industrial and scientific interests" and prevention of "organized delinquency." "In general, I think it’s accurate to say that French surveillance law is more permissive than U.S. surveillance law," Sales said in an interview. Bob Turner, a professor at the University of Virginia’s Center for National Security Law, agreed. "Our system is far more respectful of individual rights," Turner said. "The French have no equivalent to the Fourth Amendment (protection against search and seizure), and both law enforcement and intelligence services routinely collect data that would require a warrant here." Our ruling Paul said that "in France, they have a (surveillance) program a thousandfold more invasive" than the United States.’ " The term "a thousandfold" is impossible to measure and is presumably a rhetorical flourish on Paul’s part. Still, we found five notable areas in which the French system offers law enforcement and government officials more unfettered tools than American officials have the ability to use. We rate Paul’s statement Mostly True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2015-12-08T17:25:54	2015-12-06	['France', 'United_States']
pomt-09617	A recent Obama executive order could "lead to a number of investigations by Interpol in the United States, potentially aimed at American officials."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/12/newt-gingrich/gingrich-claims-interpol-will-investigate-american/	Conservatives have long feared that America is losing its sovereignty to international organizations, dating back to the John Birch Society issuing warnings about "one world government" in the 1950s. And perhaps nothing evokes this fear more than the possibility of an international police or military force with power over American citizens. A recent executive order signed by President Barack Obama dealing with the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, has reignited those fears. During a Jan. 4, 2010, appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said: "The president recently signed very quietly an executive order that basically releases Interpol from all American constraints. Freedom of Information Acts don't apply. All the constraints that you as a citizen could use against an American police force, based on a recent Obama-signed executive order, give Interpol, which has relationships with Syria, with Libya, with Iran, it gives them all sorts of extralegality in the United States in a way that has never ever before been offered to Interpol. And I'm very curious as to why the president is doing this. ... What I'm told is that it could lead to a number of investigations by Interpol in the United States, potentially aimed at American officials. And the question I would raise is, why would the president of the United States give that kind of extralegal protection to an international police force?" "So you're saying that if there was any abuse by the CIA or something like that, that Interpol now has more authority to come into the United States and investigate it?" O'Reilly asked. "Yes," the Georgia Republican replied. So Gingrich was raising the specter of an unaccountable group of foreigners coming to the United States with the approval of President Obama and arresting CIA officers or other American government officials. The key problem with this notion is that Interpol couldn't investigate CIA or American officials, because Interpol doesn't do investigations. Although Interpol is often portrayed in movies as an international police force, solving crimes and arresting bad guys, its actual purposes are modest: It helps police organizations in different countries communicate and coordinate actions, provides databases of crime information (fingerprints, stolen artwork, names of suspected terrorists), training and other support services. It doesn't arrest anyone, and doesn't even have its own officers. Instead, police forces from around the world loan their officers to the organization. "All investigations are done by national police," Interpol spokeswoman Rachel Billington said. "We don't have powers of arrest." So if this executive order doesn't surrender American authority, what does it do? It ensures Interpol is treated the same way any other international organization that operates on American soil is treated. Like diplomats, international organizations in the United States are given certain immunities and privileges. A 1983 executive order signed by President Ronald Reagan gave Interpol some of these privileges, but others were withheld because the organization didn't have an office on U.S. soil at the time. In 2004, Interpol opened an office near the United Nations in New York, and the Obama administration has just gotten around to giving it the rights most other international organizations have. What are these rights? Most of them deal with federal and customs taxes, but one grants Interpol immunity from having its property -- including its archives -- searched or seized. We spoke with Gingrich's representatives and spokesman Joe DeSantis e-mailed this response: "The argument that Interpol currently 'doesn't' do a certain activity misses the point. The executive order effectively removes the U.S.’s ability to know what Interpol is doing, and thus, if it wanted to start doing investigations into (for instance) American officials, it could, and the U.S. would have no way to ever know its activities since we have granted them immunity." But there's no reason to believe Interpol will suddenly reverse 87 years of precedent and begin to investigate and prosecute crimes. And for an organization based around the sharing of information, it's hard to think it will begin top-secret investigations of high-profile Americans, particularly when the current head of Interpol, Ronald Noble, is an American who served as a top official in the Treasury Department under President Bill Clinton. Noble told the conservative Web site Human Events that "the executive order gives Interpol no law-enforcement or investigative powers to engage in activities on U.S. soil." Noble said that included "searches, seizures or arrests in the U.S." DeSantis pointed us to a National Review Online piece by Andy McCarthy. It argues that even if Interpol has no plans to investigate Americans, the "order removes the negative legal restraints that block Interpol from conducting unauthorized police activity." Even if no one thought other law enforcement organizations -- he cites the New York Police Department and the FBI -- were going to abuse their police powers, McCarthy argues, we still wouldn't remove the congressional and judicial checks that prevent them from doing so. But, again, Interpol doesn't have police powers to abuse. It can't arrest anyone, and it doesn't conduct investigations. And even if it did, the organization's constitution bounds it to operate "within the limits of the laws existing in the different countries." The only relevant law Obama's executive order waives covers search and seizure, and that right can be reclaimed if the president deems it necessary. Much of the teeth-gnashing likely has roots in Interpol's relationship with the International Criminal Court in the Hague, another landmark for those who see the erosion of American sovereignty. Some blogs have raised the possibility of Interpol arresting Bush administration officials for trial at the ICC. But this is a misrepresentation of the relationship between the two organizations. True, the ICC would theoretically be responsible for investigating and prosecuting war crimes allegations against U.S. officials. But Interpol would still lack the power to arrest those officials. Instead, it would put out a "red notice" alerting domestic law enforcement agencies that the person is wanted by the ICC. Regardless, the ICC can only investigate crimes that are referred to it by the U.N. Security Council, that occur on the soil of a signatory to the court or are committed by nationals of a signatory to the court. The U.S. hasn't signed on to the ICC and can use its position on the Security Council to veto any referral. So any situation in which an ICC prosecutes an American is far-fetched. As for a few other parts of Gingrich's statement: Interpol does have relationships with Syria, Iran and Libya, but its 188 members include stalwart U.S. allies like the United Kingdom, Israel and Australia. And as an international organization, Interpol never would have been subject to FOIA. The United States' National Central Bureau -- which is based at the Justice Department in Washington and is the main point of communication between the United States and Interpol -- says it will continue to respond to FOIA requests. The sheer impossibility of the claims hasn't stopped them from becoming conservative talking points. After apparently originating on the blog ThreatsWatch, the claims spread to the aforementioned National Review piece, RedState.com, a column by Chuck Norris on WorldNetDaily and have been mentioned by Glenn Beck on his TV show. Beck, perhaps looking to add some credibility to the idea, declared: "The oddest part is the story was actually reported on in the New York Times. Yes." While the Times did report on the executive order, the story debunked many of the claims being made about it. Charlie Savage, the reporter who wrote the story, wrote in a Twitter message: "Debunking hysterical conspiracy theories about Obama's Interpol executive order." That's exactly what Gingrich's claims are: conspiracy theories, based on wild conjecture, not reality. For fanning the flames of paranoia, Gringrich's claims earn a Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7c646785-156a-4922-b957-12ef24ec4fb9	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2010-01-12T21:39:27	2010-01-04	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-05474	Says that when adjusted for inflation and population growth, state general revenue spending has decreased 10.7 percent on his watch.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/20/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-state-general-revenue-spending/	On the defensive several times during the April 13, 2012, Republican U.S. Senate debate, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst countered a charge that he has never cut the budget by saying he has done just that numerous times and "by billions and billions of dollars." Dewhurst was responding to fellow Senate hopeful Ted Cruz, who questioned Dewhurst’s record by saying that "in (Dewhurst’s) entire tenure in elected office, he has never once cut one penny from the state budget." Dewhurst replied that Cruz, a Houston lawyer, was wrongly focusing on the size of the total state budget — including state and federal funds — when he should be zeroing in on expenditures of state revenue, often called general revenue, which Dewhurst described as "the only money that we can control." "Every conservative group that I have ever worked with has said, ‘Governor, don’t increase your general revenue spending more than inflation and population growth,’" Dewhurst said. "Not only did we do better than that, but we have cut it 10.7 percent." Elsewhere, we’re fact-checking Cruz’s charge that Dewhurst hasn’t cut a penny from the budget. Here, we’ll dig into Dewhurst’s statement that when adjusted for inflation and population growth, general revenue spending has declined nearly 11 percent while he’s led the Senate. First, a note on Dewhurst’s methodology. Limiting spending increases to the sum of inflation and population growth is advocated by small-government groups as one way to ward off what they see as excessive spending. It’s a way to keep per-resident spending from increasing other than through inflation. As backup for Dewhurst’s debate claim, his campaign sent us a spreadsheet containing details on overall state government expenditures per two-year budget period, as well as the subcategory of general revenue. The figures for the current biennium, 2012-13, are estimates. The spreadsheet also includes the historical expenditure figures adjusted for population and inflation. (The same figures are in a chart in a January 2012 report from the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters.) First, we looked at how overall spending, including state and federal funds, has changed since Dewhurst became lieutenant governor in early 2003. The estimated "all funds" expenditures for 2012-13 of $173 billion are nearly 50 percent greater than such spending in 2002-03, which was the last two-year budget period before Dewhurst assumed his gavel-wielding post. However, according to the report, once the 2012-13 figure is adjusted for inflation and population growth over the intervening years, "all funds" spending is actually down about 2.4 percent from 2002-03. Next, we looked at general revenue. According to the board’s figures, the estimated 2012-13 general revenue spending level is about 36 percent greater than the 2002-03 spending level. But adjusted for inflation and population growth, general revenue spending is estimated to be down about 11.5 percent, according to the report. That’s pretty close to the 10.7 percent that Dewhurst cited at the debate. Open and shut case? Not exactly. We spotted several wrinkles. For instance, general revenue spending, adjusted for inflation and population growth, did not drop in every biennium once Dewhurst began presiding over the Senate. According to the budget board’s report, adjusted general revenue spending, when compared to the previous biennium, rose twice and dropped three times. The biggest drop came in 2004-05, when adjusted general revenue spending declined 9.6 percent. The highest increase came in 2008-09, when the level rose 10.8 percent. More significantly, the estimated spending levels for 2012-13 in Dewhurst’s backup material and the budget board’s report fail to account for more than $6 billion in spending that the 2011 Legislature, in a maneuver to help balance the budget, pushed into the next biennium. It was much-reported during the 2011 legislative session that lawmakers failed to appropriate enough state money to cover projected Medicaid costs for 2012-13. The budget board’s report says it is expected that the 2013 Legislature will have to put more money — estimated at about $4 billion — into the program to help pay for "the last four to five months of fiscal year 2013." The report says the amount of money needed could vary based on factors such as the size of the state’s caseload and medical costs. That’s not all. Also as widely reported, lawmakers reduced spending on public education in the 2012-13 budget in part by delaying a regular $2.3 billion state payment to school districts by several days, pushing it from the end of the 2013 fiscal year into the next budget cycle. We wondered how these maneuvers might be inflating the general-revenue reduction proclaimed by Dewhurst — and made a run at rolling the postponed education payment and Medicaid costs into the estimated 2012-13 general revenue spending figures in the board report. We then adjusted for inflation and population growth using the same factors as the board staff and compared our new 2012-13 figure with the 2002-03 spending level. Our finding: Estimated general revenue spending in 2012-13 still appears to be less than such spending in 2002-03. However, the difference is 4.7 percent — not the 10.7 percent Dewhurst cited at the debate or the 11.5 percent aired by his campaign. Our ruling Dewhurst’s debate claim that state general revenue spending dropped by 10.7 percent on his watch is close to the 11.5 percent reduction that a comparison of 2012-13 estimated spending to 2002-03 spending yields. But that result is misleading, too simplistic. First, it overlooks changes — up and down — in general revenue spending, adjusted for inflation and population growth, between each of the preceding two-year budgets. Second, the spending figure for 2012-13 does not account for more than $6 billion in state costs postponed to the next budget period. Rolling in those costs, making for a closer-to-realistic accounting of costs in the latest Dewhurst-touched budget, shrinks the difference of 11.5 percent to 4.7 percent. We rate Dewhurst’s claim Half True.	None	David Dewhurst	None	None	None	2012-04-20T13:27:01	2012-04-13	['None']
pomt-09945	In the 100 days since its passage, the economic stimulus has "saved or created nearly 150,000 jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/29/barack-obama/150000-jobs-created-or-saved-maybe/	Now that it's been 100 days since the economic stimulus package was signed into law, President Barack Obama is praising the measure for its job-creating impact. "In these last few months, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has saved or created nearly 150,000 jobs — jobs building solar panels and wind turbines, making homes and buildings more energy efficient," Obama said during a visit to Las Vegas. "They're the jobs of teachers and police officers and nurses who have not been laid off as a consequence of this Recovery Act. They're the jobs fixing roads and bridges, jobs at start-ups and small businesses, and jobs that will put thousands of young Americans to work this summer." We were intrigued by that number of 150,000 jobs. Note the crucial point that it's jobs created or "saved." That means they're counting people who have avoided layoffs because of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. How do you count that? It's actually an estimate created by White House economists. Jared Bernstein, the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, explained the number during a conference call with reporters on May 27, 2009. "The 150,000 is a number that is derived relative to what's called a baseline, that is, relative to the amount of jobs we think we would be losing were the act not in place," Bernstein said. His argument is that even though the number of unemployed is increasing across the United States, the numbers would be bigger without the stimulus package. If you compare where employment is relative to where it would have been, "that gap between those two, that's the 150,000 thus far," Bernstein said. "We're looking at saving or creating another 600,000 over the next hundred days." A reporter asked Bernstein where the administration thought the baseline would be in 100 days. But Bernstein said he couldn't project out that far. We've long been skeptical when public officials throw out big numbers without explaining that they're talking about estimates. We're particularly wary of baselines, as we were for a previous ruling on Obama's claim about deficit reduction , because they can be unrealistic and exaggerate the impact of a policy. In the case of the stimulus, we're talking about the most significant economic downturn since the Great Depression and an unprecedented amount of government spending in an effort to get the economy going again. Certainly, the stimulus is creating some jobs. Anecdotal evidence from around the country, compiled by the Obama administration to promote its efforts, makes that case by showing that public employees in some cities and states have avoided layoffs. But those are just anecdotes. So can there be 150,000 in the first 100 days? "It's certainly plausible given the consensus of most economists believe will be the result of the stimulus over the next few years," said James Horney, director of federal fiscal policy for the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He pointed to testimony from Douglas Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress. Elmendorf said the recovery act should boost employment between 900,000 and 2.3 million by the end of the 2009. "So 150,000 seems clearly within reason," Horney said. But a policy expert from a right-leaning think tank told us that Obama's number is ridiculous. "They're just making up numbers and trying them out," said J.D Foster, senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who studies fiscal policy. "In a period when the economy is bleeding 2 million jobs, to suggest that you can identify 150,000 jobs that you've saved or created is pure fantasy." The economy has indeed lost 1.9 million jobs in February, March, and April, according to preliminary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The May numbers will be announced June 5, 2009. We also talked with an economist at Moody's Economy.com, a business-oriented research group. Gus Faucher, the site's director of macroeconomics, said the stimulus has improved people's confidence about the economy, but he said it's not yet possible to put a firm number on jobs created. The data just isn't there yet, he said, and the Labor Department will continue to adjust its unemployment data over the course of many months. "The answer is, it's too soon to tell," he said. "We may not have an answer in months or even years in terms of an exact number." Indeed, 100 days is a relatively small window to measure a package that will roll out over several years. It's important to note that the government itself has issued confusing data about what has been spent and not. On May 21, for example, the Recovery.gov Web site corrected a report that said that it had paid out $8.9 billion in unemployment money, when that was actually still money sitting in the bank waiting to be tapped. The recovery act has many reporting requirements, and states and localities are required to report on job creation. But much of that data is still coming in. (For even more details on how job data will be reported, check out this ProPublica story, Is the Stimulus Stimulating Jobs? We May Never Know for Sure .) We find that the stimulus is a complicated, ongoing effort and data collection is just getting started. The Obama administration does not provide a solid accounting for either the jobs "created" or "saved." Yes, there is anecdotal evidence that jobs are being saved, such as the 25 police recruits in Columbus, Ohio, in an example cited by Obama. But the 150,000 figure sounds specific and verifiable when actually it's the administration's best guess for a relatively small snapshot in time. Because it's not much better than a guess presented as a fact, we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-05-29T16:39:32	2009-05-27	['None']
pomt-03202	"I’ve got the spending down, I’ve got the debt down a little bit, I’ve got the reserves up."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/28/mark-harris/mark-harris-says-he-lowered-spending-and-debt-and-/	Winnebago County Executive Mark Harris, a Democrat mulling a run for governor in 2014, contends that his private-sector experience would put the state on a better course. Making the media rounds this summer, the former bank trust officer has gently criticized Gov. Scott Walker and other Republicans for what he views as overly exuberant tax cuts and borrowing. Harris, as you might expect, thinks his own record on fiscal issues is more responsible. "I’ve got the spending down, I’ve got the debt down a little bit, I’ve got the reserves up," Harris told journalist Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s "Upfront" show July 21, 2013. Harris was first elected county executive in 2005 and previously served as mayor of Oshkosh and on the Oshkosh City Council and Winnebago County Board. He has worked as a certified public accountant in Michigan and Indiana, was a lawyer in Indiana, and worked as a trust officer and vice president at Associated Trust Company in Oshkosh from 1995 until 2005. With Harris pledging to decide on running by Labor Day, we thought it was the right time to check the books on his claims. Here’s what we found: Reserves Average year-end reserves are up considerably in the Harris era, compared with the final four budget years of his predecessor, county financial records show. Under Harris, the county often has kept reserves in excess of its goal of having a cushion totalling one month of the county’s annual spending. The average annual reserve is up more than 50% on average, and in 2012 reserves swelled to nearly two months of spending, prompting the county to suspend new borrowing in 2013. The increase in unrestricted reserves has not been a steady march, but the trend is clear. Spending Harris pointed us to numbers showing that the 2013 adopted county budget set operating spending at 1 percent less than the 2005 budget -- the last one adopted before his election. We confirmed those figures, and found a four-year trend of declining or flat expenditures from 2010-’13, so Harris has some backup. The county’s finance director, Charles Orenstein, told us savings came in part from reining in fringe benefit costs, consolidation and efficiency moves in county facilities, and savings on court and jail costs through technology. But, looking more broadly, the spending trend lines look like a roller-coaster ride. Spending went up in Harris’ first four years. In fact, only in 2013 could Harris make the claim that spending is lower compared with when he came in. In every other year but this one under Harris, the county’s annual spending total was higher than in the last pre-Harris budget. Harris acknowledges that Walker’s curbs on collective bargaining saved the county money, but he contends that state aid cuts offset most if not all of the savings, at least in 2012. The county’s property tax levy has increased 24 percent in eight years under Harris as aid from other levels of government -- a category including the state -- fell off markedly, county budget records show. The property tax levy has fallen the last two years amid tight property tax caps imposed by Walker. Debt Harris said he got the county’s debt down "a little." Yes and no. Harris notes that Winnebago County’s outstanding general-obligation debt totalled $59.6 million at year-end 2012, down from $63 million in December 2004, months before he took office in April 2005. In noting that, he uses 2005 as his first year and 2004 as the baseline year. His numbers are correct, and defensible to a point. But, under the county’s capital improvement process, many debt-funded capital projects would have received approval before Harris took office. So both the previous county executive and Harris can claim an influence on the outstanding debt level in 2005. Keeping that in mind, if you instead use 2005 as the baseline year, Harris’ debt claim fails. Debt added up to $57 million in 2005, slightly lower than the mark under Harris in 2012. Harris’ claim, though, is on target by two other measures, average annual debt per capita, and average annual debt in raw dollars. In general, this is a difficult area to judge because huge projects -- a new nursing home built on Harris’ watch, for instance -- spike borrowing in certain years. The Credit Game One final issue. Harris credited himself for driving the fiscal trends. But he acknowledged that the County Board deserves some credit as well. And two veteran Winnebago County Board leaders, David Albrecht and Patrick Brennand, told us that former County Executive Jane Van De Hey and others also helped instill a cautious approach to spending. There’s also the effect of the state budget, which helped the county drive down costs while also cutting aid to the county. Our rating Harris said, "I’ve got the spending down, I’ve got the debt down a little bit, I’ve got the reserves up." He was referring to his tenure as Winnebago County executive from April 2005 to the present. He makes the best case on reserves, which clearly have risen. Spending is down when viewed narrowly. The debt burden has dropped by some measures but not by all. Harris deserves some credit for the trends, but not all. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-02517	On the Cuba embargo	full flop	/florida/statements/2014/feb/11/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-flips-cuba-embargo/	In a national TV interview on Feb. 7, 2014, former Gov. Charlie Crist announced that he supports lifting the decades-long Cuba embargo -- setting off a flurry of media attention and reaction from Republicans including Gov. Rick Scott. Scott's recently named lieutenant governor, former state legislator Carlos Lopez-Cantera, called Crist's announcement ignorant. "Charlie Crist’s comments just show his ignorance on the issue of what is going on in Cuba," said Lopez-Cantera at a Feb. 10 press conference in Broward. "As a Cuban-American, I was insulted by it. Crist, a Republican turned independent turned Democrat, is running to get his old job back from Scott. He’s also on a book tour and doing a series of national TV interviews to promote The Party’s Over: How The Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became A Democrat. On HBO’s Real Time, Bill Maher asked Crist about the Cuban vote: "I feel like this is something that has been held hostage by a small Cuban community in Florida for a very long time," Maher said. "If we had done the right thing years ago, Cuba now would be St. Barts and all the kids going on spring break would be there next month having a great time and drinking Mai Tais. But I don’t see a lot of politicians from Florida having the courage to stand up to that small Cuban community." Crist responded: "Well, I think they need to. I think it’s the right thing. The embargo’s been going on what, 50 years now, and I don’t think it worked. It is obvious to me we need to move forward and I think get the embargo taken away. From a selfish point of view, as a Floridian, I’d like to see that happen because a lot of construction would be required on the island, and South Florida could be the launching pad for all of that and really create a lot of jobs for the people of my state." We decided to research Crist’s past stances on the Cuba embargo and put them on our Flip-O-Meter, which doesn’t pass judgment on changing stances but evaluates if a candidate has flipped and to what extent. Some voters see some flips as a sign of inconsistency, while others view some flips as a sign that a politician has the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of constituents. Crist’s and Scott’s stance on the Cuba embargo will be a hot topic in Miami during the election, though there have been signs that the Cuban-American vote is less reliably Republican than it has been in the past. A poll released by the Atlantic Council in February showed Crist’s position is in line the majority of Floridians who want changes in the U.S.-Cuba relationship. Among Cubans polled in Florida, 79 percent favor normalizing relations (though the numbers of those of Cuban descent in Florida polled were small). Tensions between the U.S. and Cuba started after Fidel Castro seized power in 1959 leading to the full trade embargo in 1962. We’ll cite the Miami Herald’s explanation of the meaning of the embargo and the governor’s role: "Supporters of the 52-year-old embargo have long argued it gives the United States leverage and should not be removed until democracy returns to the island. Opponents argue that with the Castro brothers still in control of the country, the communist regime has used the embargo as an excuse to continue its abusive human rights record and oppressive economic policies. Florida’s governor has no authority to lift or modify the embargo, which would take an act of Congress, but he can influence public opinion and the issue is considered a political litmus test for many hardline Castro opponents." In 2009, Obama lifted the limit on visits by Cuban Americans to their homeland, but only Congress can rescind the embargo. Crist isn’t the only Democrat to call for dropping the embargo. U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, announced her support for ending the embargo last year. Former state sen. Nan Rich, who is running in a Democratic primary against Crist, also supports lifting the embargo. Crist’s statements about Cuba as governor In a general election debate in 2006, Crist criticized his Democratic opponent Jim Davis for visiting Cuba in 2003. "I understand that it's important not to go to Cuba when she's under the dictatorship, but unfortunately the man I'm running against doesn't understand that," Crist said while campaigning in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood in October 2006. "But I know that you do." After Crist won the governor’s race, Crist was asked in 2006 whether he would support altering the embargo to let Floridians send more money to family. "No. I feel very strongly about not supporting the totalitarian dictator's regime, and I understand others may have a different point of view. It just isn't mine. I believe in freedom, and I support the embargo. I've been counseled about it by Mario Diaz-Balart and Lincoln (Dias-Balart) and the senator and Ileana (Ros-Lehtinen), and I trust their judgment very much. You know, I'm the kind of guy that, you know, if there are other people who are more expert or closer to a particular issue, I think it's important to seek their counsel and rely upon it, and in this area, I do." As a Republican governor, Crist signed a law in 2008 that required Florida-based companies selling trips to countries on the U.S. State Department’s list of nations that sponsor terrorism to put up a $250,000 bond and pay registration fees. More than a dozen travel agencies sued the state and a federal district judge ruled the law unconstitutional in 2009. In April 2010 as he struggled in a U.S. Senate Republican primary against Marco Rubio, Crist left the party and ran as an independent. One month later, he told the Sun-Sentinel editorial board: "The problem is you have this totalitarian regime that is down there that locks up journalists, suppresses freedom, doesn’t allow for open dialogue. And I think unless and until that begins to occur it is not in Florida’s or I don’t think America’s best interest to be embracing of that kind of a government." When the Sentinel asked Crist if he would be open to fewer restrictions on travel to Cuba, Crist said: "No, I wouldn’t. Not until they offer more freedoms to their own people first and demonstrate they are serious about it." While campaigning in Miami Beach in June 2010, Crist reiterated his support for the embargo but said he supported Obama’s decision to allow Cuban-Americans to freely visit their relatives. "I think the current policy in place is responsible," said Crist. "I do support the embargo, and I think that what the current administration has done by allowing families to visit (Cuba) is compassionate.'' Crist running as a Democrat After the interview with Maher, Crist released a statement his campaign shared with PolitiFact Florida: "The embargo has done nothing in more than 50 years to change the regime in Cuba. If we want to bring democracy to Cuba, we need to encourage American values and investment there, not block ourselves out and cede influence to China. It will take time, and we must do it in a way where American investment helps people, not the dictatorship. But the reality is that no state's economy is hurt more by America’s Cuba policies than Florida. Changing these policies to allow Florida’s’ farmers, manufacturers, and construction industry to sell goods and services in Cuba would boost Florida's economy and help businesses create more jobs in our state." Our ruling While campaigning for governor, serving as governor and running for the U.S. Senate, Crist supported the embargo. Even once he left the GOP he continued to support it, though he also agreed with Obama’s decision to ease travel restrictions. But on national TV in 2014, Crist changed position and said the embargo has failed and that we should "get the embargo taken away." A poll released days after Crist’s announcement reflects that his new position is in line with the majority of Floridians. We rate his change of position on the embargo for Cuba a Full Flop.

pomt-09689	The House of Representatives does not have a prochoice majority.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/11/loretta-sanchez/abortion-votes-house-play-out-stupak-amendment/	One of the more interesting twists in health care reform came on a recent vote in the House of Representatives on abortion coverage. An amendment restricting abortion coverage authored by Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democrat from Michigan, won the votes of all Republicans and 64 Democrats to become part of the health care reform bill passed by the House on Saturday. His measure further tightened rules about how insurers could offer abortion coverage, requiring them to offer separate policies in many instances. (Read our detailed explanation of the Stupak amendment here .) Abortion rights advocates should not have been surprised, said Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat from California, on the MSNBC show Morning Joe . Sanchez, who favors abortion rights, said that "progressives are really angry" because they believe poor women should have the choice to get an abortion if they want one. "On the other hand, we have to acknowledge that the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice," Sanchez said. "And I've told that to a lot of pro-choice groups. I would count maybe about 150 prochoice votes. You need 218 to get to pass a bill." We wanted to know if Sanchez was correct that "the House of Representatives is not majority prochoice." We first turned to an organization that favors abortion rights. NARAL Pro-Choice America rates members of Congress and has compiled its own profile of the current Congress. It labeled 185 members "prochoice." Then we turned to the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion. It doesn't rate the entire Congress in the same way, but the group has rated four abortion votes during the current Congress and created percentage ratings for each member. A 100 percent rating means a member fully agreed with the positions of National Right to Life; a 0 percent rating means they did not agree at all. We crunched the numbers, looking for members who never voted with the position of National Right to Life -- 185, the same as NARAL's "prochoice" members. Other numbers tend to support Sanchez's conclusion, but they also reveal the complexity of the issue and the fact that every member doesn't fall neatly into a yes-or-no category. NARAL labeled 203 members "antichoice." National Right to Life gave only 179 members 100 percent ratings. NARAL labeled 47 members "mixed choice," while National Right to Life found that 71 members voted with the group some of the time. So do those numbers add up to the conclusion that there isn't a "prochoice majority" in the House? NARAL spokesman Ted Miller agreed with Sanchez's comments. "It is accurate to state that antichoice lawmakers outnumber our prochoice allies," Miller said in an e-mail interview. "While the numbers are challenging, we have managed to win some key votes this session (family-planning vote and lifting D.C. abortion ban) by gaining support from some mixed- and even antichoice members." National Right to Life spokesman Douglas Johnson, on the other hand, downplayed the idea that antiabortion sentiment is growing in the House. His side does win some votes, he said, and the Stupak amendment was "the clearest vote on abortion that we've had in the current Congress." But he doubts that Congress would overturn the U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade , a major precedent establishing abortion rights. "If you had a vote in the House on whether or not to overturn Roe vs. Wade , I believe that the majority would affirm that they would support it," Johnson said. In fact, a few members of Congress who voted for the Stupak amendment otherwise receive low ratings from National Right to Life. We counted 34 members who voted with the group on Stupak's amendment but against it on other issues. Indeed, the Stupak amendment represents a classic gray area: The measure does not forbid insurers from covering abortion, but it requires them to offer separate policies for people who pay for plans with their own money (as opposed to those who pay part of their premiums with government subsidies). Those who favor abortion rights say this will discourage insurers from offering coverage that includes abortion, and perhaps it will. But that's a business decision on the part of the insurers, not a government prohibition. We should add here that the Stupak amendment might not make it to the final bill, once the Senate considers its own version of health care reform. Getting back to Sanchez's statement: She said, "the House of Representatives is not a majority prochoice." Her claim is supported by counts from both sides that show only 185 members are solidly in favor of abortion rights. It's worth noting that the number of antiabortion House members is less than a majority, too. But as for Sanchez's claim, she is right. We rate her claim True.

pomt-03973	"Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts" to create a legal framework on counterterrorism.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-hes-kept-congress-fully-informed/	After being criticized for using drones to kill suspected terrorists, including American citizens, President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address that he has been transparent with Congress about his administration’s policy. "Where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans," Obama said. "Now, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That's why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts. Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts." With all the controversy, we wondered if it was correct that he'd kept Congress "fully informed." The White House’s case The White House told us Obama has been transparent about his policies on the killings, citing speeches by two high-ranking officials on how the administration decides to target a terrorist suspect. One was by Attorney General Eric Holder at Northwestern University School of Law on March 5, 2012. The other was by John Brennan, now Obama’s pick to head the CIA, at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars on April 30, 2012. The White House also noted that in the run-up to Brennan’s confirmation hearing, the administration released key documents to the committee, including a 2010 memo by the Office of Legal Counsel that laid the groundwork for the U.S. drone strike a year later on Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric tied to Al Qaida. Those documents were to be studied privately by the committee and were not made public. However, NBC News obtained a shorter "white paper" that is believed to have been derived from the longer Office of Legal Counsel memo. The White House also highlighted a comment that Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, made in an interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. When Mitchell asked whether the president "is making the decision with no congressional or judicial oversight," Rogers replied, "I'll disagree a little bit. There is oversight." Referring to the al-Awlaki case, Rogers said, "I knew about the operations leading up to it and I review all of the airstrikes that we use under this title of the law." How lawmakers see it However, several lawmakers, including several senior senators, have spent years seeking documents from the administration, which indicates that not everyone agrees with Obama’s claim of having kept Congress "fully informed." Four days before the State of the Union address, a blog by Marcy Wheeler called "emptywheel" assembled a list of 15 instances from the past two years in which lawmakers have sought information from the administration about its policy on targeted killing. The blog post backs up its claims with links to original documents. The lawmakers seeking information include Republicans (Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Rep. Tom Graves of Georgia) and Democrats (Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Reps. John Conyers of Michigan, Jerry Nadler of New York and Bobby Scott of Virginia). Some examples: • Following a June 7, 2012, hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on Justice Department oversight, members of the panel sent a series of follow-up questions to Holder. Among these was a series of questions by Nadler on targeted killing policy. Among other things, Nadler wrote that "we have yet to get any response to our requests" for information on the Office of Legal Counsel memo that would later be provided privately to the House and Senate intelligence committees. • On Dec. 4, 2012, three Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee -- Conyers, the ranking Democrat, plus Nadler and Scott -- wrote a letter to Holder saying that the "white paper" provided to the committee was insufficient. "Unfortunately, while providing some additional information, the paper does not fully satisfy our prior requests or fulfill our ongoing need for information that allows us to conduct meaningful congressional oversight," the lawmakers wrote. • On Feb. 4, 2013, a bipartisan group of 11 senators wrote to Obama asking for "any and all legal opinions that lay out the executive branch’s official understanding of the president’s authority to deliberately kill American citizens." • Finally, on Feb. 8, 2013, six House Judiciary Committee members -- Conyers, Nadler and Scott, plus Republicans Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, the panel’s chairman; James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Trent Franks of Arizona -- wrote to Obama requesting the opportunity to view the same documents he had shown to the intelligence committees. Meanwhile, Wyden suggested at Brennan’s hearing that he was not satisfied with the administration’s release to the intelligence committees. While he called the release a "good first step," Wyden asked Brennan whether he would "go back to the White House and convey to them the message that the Justice Department is not yet following through on the president's commitment." (Brennan said he would.) Wyden also asked Brennan to release "any and all countries where the intelligence community has used its lethal authorities." (On that request, Brennan was noncommittal.) The office of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., released a statement to PolitiFact for this story, saying, "Sen. Leahy has reviewed the Department of Justice white paper on targeted killings of U.S. citizens, but the White Paper raises more questions than it answers. The White Paper is not an adequate substitute for any Office of Legal Counsel opinions that may address this issue. Sen. Leahy for a considerable period of time publicly and privately has pressed the administration to disclose any such opinions to Congress, and he recently also was part of a larger group of senators who, on a bipartisan basis, asked the president to direct the Department of Justice to turn over any Office of Legal Counsel opinions. He looks forward to hearing from the administration on this issue." Coming from a senior senator -- Leahy chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee -- and a member of the president’s own party, this perspective carries some weight in our analysis. Our ruling The White House has certainly provided some information to Congress and the public about the process of targeting suspected terrorists, and the adversarial relationship between the executive branch almost ensures that not every one of the 535 members of Congress will be satisfied with what the executive branch discloses. Still, we think the magnitude of the complaints, and the fact that they’re bipartisan, suggest that this goes well beyond a small fringe of lawmakers. We particularly find problems with the president’s claim that he’s been transparent "throughout" his term and has kept Congress "fully informed." The requests for additional information have been pending for much of the president’s tenure in office, a far cry from being transparent "throughout" his term. And a recurring theme of these requests is not that the administration is providing no information, but that it is holding back on a portion of the information being sought, which is the opposite of keeping Congress "fully informed."

pomt-11000	"Many countries (in NATO) owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back, where they’re delinquent, as far as I’m concerned, because the United States has had to pay for them."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/11/donald-trump/trump-falsely-claims-nato-countries-owe-united-sta/	During a bilateral breakfast with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump blasted the alliance’s other members over lagging contributions to NATO’s joint defense spending. "Many countries are not paying what they should," Trump said. "And, frankly, many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back, where they’re delinquent, as far as I’m concerned, because the United States has had to pay for them." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This was not the first time Trump has demanded that NATO countries contribute more to the military alliance, and we have fact-checked similar statements before. But the sweeping nature of this claim inspired us to take another look at one of the president’s oft-repeated complaints. As it turns out, Trump’s statement shows a misunderstanding of the way NATO spending works. Other member countries do not owe the United States or NATO any money. ‘Many countries are not paying what they should’ Formally the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO was established in 1949 for the purpose of providing collective security against Soviet aggression and expansion. Ten European nations signed on to the original agreement along with the United States and Canada. In signing the treaty, the original members agreed that "an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all" to which each member would respond by taking "such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force." NATO has swelled to 29 member countries with the stated purpose "to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means." As of 2014, NATO’s collective agreement instructed member countries to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. According to NATO’s most recent report detailing members’ defense expenditures, only five countries currently satisfy that threshold: the United States, Greece, the United Kingdom, Estonia and Latvia. But other countries still have several years to reach the target commitment, and for those experiencing significant economic growth, increases in defense spending may take some time to reflect change to the share of GDP. Daniel Benjamin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and professor at Dartmouth College with an expertise in foreign policy and security, noted that "the trend lines are going in the right direction" for many countries that are underspending at the moment. ‘Many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money’ The White House did not respond to a request to clarify this point. Several experts explained that the president was likely referring, albeit incorrectly, to the commitment to devote 2 percent of GDP to defense spending. "It most certainly is not true, as the president has suggested repeatedly, that other NATO countries owe us money," said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. "The 2 percent figure refers to what each country spends on its defense, as a share of that country’s GDP. It does not imply owing the U.S. anything." NATO countries do not pay money to a broad NATO defense budget. NATO defense spending is "not money that is going to be put in some kitty at NATO," Benjamin said. In reality, each country determines its own level of military spending, said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council for Global Affairs and the former U.S. ambassador to NATO under former President Barack Obama. "No one owes us any money," Daalder said. "Nor is the U.S. spending more because allies are spending less ... our defense spending is a national decision and is determined by our national security and defense needs." "Countries falling short means not that they owe anyone money, but that countries have weaker militaries than we would like," added Stephen Saideman, a professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs. "NATO is not a country club." Preble also noted that a more specific remark might have been slightly more accurate. "If Donald Trump was claiming that the United States needed to spend more on the Pentagon because we have obligations under NATO to come to others’ defense, and those obligations are more onerous and thus costly because others are not spending enough on their defense, that would be more accurate," Preble said. "But he’s not saying that." The United States does pay for approximately 22 percent of a small, commonly-funded budget that concerns civilian and some military expenses, Daalder noted. That budget, which is less than $5 billion, is funded by all NATO members based on a cost-sharing formula that considers gross national income and other factors. But Daalder said "no one is in arrears or delinquent on any payments" for that budget, either. Our ruling Trump said that "many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back." NATO members agreed to contribute at least 2 percent of their country’s GDP toward defense by 2024, but that defense spending does not take the form of payments to the United States or the alliance as a whole.

pomt-05608	Says Congressman Bill Pascrell "voted to remove the public option from the Affordable Health Care Act."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/28/steve-rothman/steve-rothman-claims-bill-pascrell-voted-remove-pu/	As Democratic primary voters search for differences between U.S. Reps. Steve Rothman and Bill Pascrell, Rothman claims that support for a government-run health insurance plan separates them. Calling himself the more progressive Democrat, Rothman pointed out various differences between him and Pascrell during a March 16 interview on NJToday. Rothman and Pascrell are preparing to battle June 5 for their party’s nomination to represent the 9th Congressional District. Among those differences, Rothman claimed that "Bill voted to remove the public option from the Affordable Health Care Act." PolitiFact New Jersey checked the voting records and found that Rothman is wrong to claim Pascrell voted to remove the public option. In fact, the congressmen cast the same votes on major health care reform measures in late 2009 and early 2010. Like Rothman, Pascrell voted in November 2009 in support of a House bill that included a public plan as part of overhauling the nation’s health care system. A public option was later scrapped in a U.S. Senate version of health care reform, which became the final law. First, let’s explain the congressmen’s voting records on health care reform. In a 220-215 vote on Nov. 7, 2009, the House narrowly approved the Affordable Health Care for America Act, which included a public health insurance option. Pascrell and Rothman both voted for the bill. The following month, the Senate approved its own health care reform bill, called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in a 60-39 vote. That legislation did not include a public plan option. The House would later pass the Senate bill in a 219-212 vote on March 21, 2010, sending it to President Barack Obama to become law. The reform law was later modified by a separate piece of legislation. Pascrell and Rothman both voted for the Senate bill, and the legislation making changes to it. So, Pascrell did not vote "to remove the public option." Pascrell voted for a House bill that included the public option, but a Senate health care overhaul bill -- which became the final law -- did not include it. Paul Swibinski, a consultant to Rothman’s campaign, told us in an e-mail that "Steve misspoke when he said that Pascrell voted against the public option. Steve meant to say that Pascrell opposed the public option." Swibinski pointed to a January 2010 Congressional Quarterly Today article, which stated Pascrell was proposing a series of scaled-back health care bills. "No 'public option,' no mandates, no entitlements," Pascrell is quoted as saying in the article. Sean Darcy, a spokesman for the Pascrell campaign, argued that at the time of the article, "the public option was dead." Various news articles in early January 2010 indicate that House Democrats had abandoned hopes for a public option in light of the Senate vote. "Pascrell was still very much in favor of the public option and was extremely supportive of it," Darcy said in an e-mail. "As noted, the Senate bill did not include the public option so the consensus among the people actually fighting to get a substantive health care bill passed was that this piece was no longer an option. With all this in mind, Pascrell was acknowledging that we needed to move on and find a way to get health care reform done." Before and after the health care reform was enacted, Pascrell publicly expressed his support for a government-run health insurance plan. In an August 2009 opinion piece, Pascrell wrote, "Health care reform without the public health insurance option would be a hollow one." An August 2010 article on PolitickerNJ.com quoted a Pascrell spokesman as saying the congressman "remains a supporter of the public option." Our ruling In an NJToday interview, Rothman claimed Pascrell "voted to remove the public option from the Affordable Health Care Act." But Pascrell voted in November 2009 for a House bill that included a public option. The Senate approved a reform bill that didn’t include a public option, and that version became the final law.

pomt-10676	" ... following World War II war crime trials were convened. The Japanese were tried and convicted and hung for war crimes committed against American POWs. Among those charges for which they were convicted was waterboarding."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/18/john-mccain/history-supports-mccains-stance-on-waterboarding/	The morning after the CNN/YouTube debate in St. Petersburg, John McCain remained firm in his stand against the use of an interrogation technique called "waterboarding." He cited solid history to buttress his position. "I forgot to mention last night that following World War II war crime trials were convened. The Japanese were tried and convicted and hung for war crimes committed against American POWs. Among those charges for which they were convicted was waterboarding," he told reporters at a campaign event. "If the United States is in another conflict ... and we have allowed that kind of torture to be inflicted upon people we hold captive, then there is nothing to prevent that enemy from also torturing American prisoners." McCain is referencing the Tokyo Trials, officially known as the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. After World War II, an international coalition convened to prosecute Japanese soldiers charged with torture. At the top of the list of techniques was water-based interrogation, known variously then as "water cure," "water torture" and "waterboarding," according to the charging documents. It simulates drowning. R. John Pritchard, a historian and lawyer who is a top scholar on the trials, said the Japanese felt the ends justified the means. "The rapid and effective collection of intelligence then, as now, was seen as vital to a successful struggle, and in addition, those who were engaged in torture often felt that whatever pain and anguish was suffered by the victims of torture was nothing less than the just deserts of the victims or people close to them," he said. In a recent journal essay, Judge Evan Wallach, a member of the U.S. Court of International Trade and an adjunct professor in the law of war, writes that the testimony from American soldiers about this form of torture was gruesome and convincing. A number of the Japanese soldiers convicted by American judges were hanged, while others received lengthy prison sentences or time in labor camps.

pomt-06944	Says that, unlike the U.S. Senate, "even the Libyan government, in the middle of a civil war, passed a budget on June 15, 2011"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/19/ann-marie-buerkle/rep-ann-marie-buerkle-uses-passage-libyan-budget-s/	In a news release dated June 24, 2011, freshman Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle, R-N.Y., made a striking comparison. Buerkle used the release to tout a bill she was offering -- the Just Do Your Job Act of 2011 -- which would "effectively defund" the House and Senate budget committees and leadership offices if they failed to pass a budget. Buerkle argued that "by not presenting any plan to address the out-of-control debt and deficit, the Senate is contributing to the risk of a national financial crisis." Later, she added that "even the Libyan government, in the middle of a civil war, passed a budget on June 15, 2011." A reader saw the Libya comparison and asked us to check it out. We considered the possibility that Buerkle inserted the line as a lark -- her staff didn’t get back to us to clarify its purpose -- but even if the comparison was offered in a flip manner, its inclusion in a news release about a serious legislative issue made it fair game for the Truth-O-Meter. We’ll start by noting that the the U.S. Senate, under Democratic leadership, has not passed a budget since April 29, 2009, and that has recently become something of a Republican talking point. For instance, on May 19, 2011, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said that "the Democrat-led Senate has failed to pass a budget for 750 days ... Senate Democrats have neglected one of their most basic responsibilities." We rated that statement Half True, noting that the math was correct, but adding that Republicans shared some responsibility. Earlier, we gave the same Half True rating to a similar statement by George LeMieux, a Republican Senate candidate from Florida. We were able to corroborate the date of the Libyan budget passage through a news report. In a June 15, 2011, dispatch filed from Rabat, Morocco, Reuters reported that "Libya's government approved a $31.4 billion budget for the rest of 2011, the official news agency said on Wednesday." The budget was approved despite a civil war between Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi and rebels based in the eastern city of Benghazi, backed by U.S.-led NATO forces. So Buerkle was right that Libya’s government passed a budget on that date. But the Truth-O-Meter also takes context into account -- and the question of how accurate this comparison is turns out to be somewhat nuanced. On the one hand, Gadhafi has been Libya’s dictator for more than four decades, so one would not expect the same checks and balances that the United States government has. As the U.S. State Department describes it, "Libya's political system is in theory based on the political philosophy in Gadhafi's Green Book, which combines socialist and Islamic theories and rejects parliamentary democracy and political parties. In reality, Gadhafi exercises near-total control over major government decisions." Samer S. Shehata, an assistant professor of Arab politics at Georgetown University, told PolitiFact that "I will certainly say what should be obvious to anyone: The Libyan regime under Gadhafi, in power since 1969, is not a legitimate government with serious ‘institutions.’" Still, one Libyan-born academic expert now working in the U.S. said that the Libyan budget process is a bit more complicated than Gadhafi and a couple of his cronies simply ordering up some spreadsheets. Karim Mezran, an adjunct professor of Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, said that "despite Libya being a dictatorship, the administration of the state has always been quite serious." He said that a budget (minus defense outlays) is presented for approval by the Council of Ministers -- Gadhafi’s cabinet -- and once the ministers approve it, it is sent to the General People’s Congress, a legislative body that serves an intermediary between the masses and the leadership. If the General People’s Congress approves it, the budget is signed into law. "It can be a long process involving negotiation between various centers of power," Mezran said. That said, Mezran agreed that the comparison with the U.S. budget situation isn’t exactly apt. "The comparison is inappropriate not because of the fact that Libya is a dictatorship but mainly because of the different sizes of the two countries, the complexity of the instrument, the number of interests and the complexity of the negotiations involved," Mezran said. There’s another reason the comparison is problematic: The June budget passage was less an ordinary governmental action than a way for the embattled regime to send a message to the world that it’s still alive. According to Reuters, the June budget -- a revision of a budget initially approved in January -- was "apparently aimed at showing (that the Libyan government) was functioning as normal despite air strikes and sanctions." The dispatch said the budget approval appeared to be an attempt by Gadhafi "to show his government was still solvent" in the face of comments by Libya's former central bank governor, Farhat Bengdara, suggesting that Gadhafi’s government had just $500 million left in cash at the end of February, plus 155 tons of gold bars. Bengdara defected in March. Sanctions have led both to the seizure of some of Libya’s assets held overseas and to a blockage of oil sales that cut off flows of foreign currency into Libya, Reuters reported. So where does this leave us? Buerkle is right about two things: the U.S. Senate hasn’t passed a budget in more than two years, and Libya passed one as recently as June of this year. In addition, the Libyan budget would have had to go through some formal steps of governance. Still, even if Buerkle intended it to be a lighthearted comparison, we feel she’s wrong to imply equivalence between the two budget processes. Libya is a dictatorship, not a well-established constitutional democracy. Libya’s budget is much less complicated than the U.S. budget, since Libya’s gross domestic product is less than one-half of 1 percent of the GDP of United States. And the passage of the budget in June is seen as demonstrating less about Libya’s normal functioning of government and more about the Gadhafi regime’s need to show the world that it’s withstanding the offensives of the NATO-backed rebels. We give Buerkle credit for her facts, but demerits for her interpretation. So we rate her statement Half True.	None	Ann Marie Buerkle	None	None	None	2011-07-19T15:53:31	2011-06-24	['Libya']

pomt-00833	U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy "voted to allow members of Congress to receive taxpayer-funded health care for life."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2015/mar/25/national-republican-senatorial-committee/patrick-murphy-voted-free-lifetime-health-care-con/	The 2016 Senate race in Florida officially kicked into high gear March 23 when U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, became the first major candidate to announce he will run for Sen. Marco Rubio’s seat. Murphy, 31, has built a reputation as a middle-of-the-road Democrat, but he could face a challenge on the left from U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson of Orlando. If Rubio runs for president, Murphy is still certain to face a heavyweight on the GOP side -- potentially Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera or CFO Jeff Atwater. Murphy has said he will run whether Rubio runs or not. On the day of Murphy’s announcement, the National Republican Senatorial Committee unveiled a website attacking his positions on several topics, including the Affordable Care Act and health care for members of Congress: "Murphy voted to keep Obamacare the law of the land but also voted to allow members of Congress to receive taxpayer-funded health care for life!" Did Murphy vote for permanent health care for members of Congress, including himself? Actually, no. Members of Congress do not get health care for life, and Murphy has never voted to give them health care for life. Instead, the NRSC is twisting generic votes in favor of the health care law into an entirely new -- and false -- attack. Murphy and the Affordable Care Act Murphy won his first race for Congress against Allen West in 2012, so he wasn’t in office when Congress approved the Affordable Care Act in 2010. On the campaign trail in 2012, Murphy said he supported the health care law, but also thought it could be improved. He criticized some of the requirements on businesses, such as the requirement for filing complicated 1099 forms, which was later repealed. While in office, he has taken votes related to the health care law -- for example, he joined most Democrats in opposing a bill which would have prevented the IRS from enforcing any portion of Obamacare. The NRSC pointed to a few votes by Murphy including on May 16, 2013, to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Murphy voted against it -- as did all but two Democrats while Republicans overwhelmingly supported it. The bill passed the House 229-195 but never passed the Senate. So what would repeal have to do with members of Congress getting their own insurance? The health care law requires members of Congress to obtain health insurance through an online marketplace, such as healthcare.gov. Previously, lawmakers bought insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, in which federal employees younger than 65 chose a plan and split premiums with the federal government. If Congress ever repealed Obamacare, members would go back to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. But here’s the problem with the claim: Members of Congress don’t get to use the federal health plan forever. Instead, it’s similar to getting insurance through work. When they lose the election -- essentially losing their job -- they have to find a new way to get health insurance. The NRSC also cited Murphy’s vote 2014 against a congressional resolution that included repeal of the health care law. Democrats including Murphy unanimously voted against it. Included along with the resolution is a "policy statement on responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars" that states: "Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life." By voting against the resolution, "Patrick Murphy voted to allow Members of Congress to receive taxpayer funded healthcare for life," NRSC spokesman Matt Connelly told PolitiFact Florida. But unlike the earlier vote, this one has an added wrinkle in that it carried no power. Both Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense and Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown’s Government Affairs Institute, said that the House budget resolution doesn’t have the weight of law and it doesn’t go to the president for signature. Murphy’s spokesman Richard Carbo told PolitiFact Florida that "essentially, the so-called 'ban' is nothing more than words on a page." "It was a bogus and misleading claim then, and it is a bogus and misleading claim now," said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. "Obamacare actually gives all Americans the opportunity to obtain what members of Congress already have: access to decent, affordable health insurance." As a side note, attacks about Congress voting for "free health care for life" are not exclusively made by Republicans. Health care experts we interviewed in 2013 debunked a similar claim by Democrats that repeal of the health care law would lead to free insurance for life for Congress. And Democrats used that attack line again in 2014. We rated both those claims as Pants on Fire wrong. Our ruling The NRSC said that Murphy "voted to allow members of Congress to receive taxpayer-funded health care for life." The NRSC cites votes Murphy took against repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Even if those votes led to actual repeal -- which they didn’t -- members of Congress would not get free healthcare for life. This was a misleading claim when Democrats tried their versions of it in the past -- and it’s just as misleading now. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-11101	"101 utilities cut rates, credit GOP tax cuts."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/11/donald-trump/have-101-utilities-cut-rates-thanks-gop-tax-bill/	For months, President Donald Trump has been touting the benefits of the tax law he signed in December. But in early June, he began expanding his argument beyond lower tax bills to lower energy bills. On June 7, Trump tweeted, "$3 billion payoff: 101 utilities cut rates, credit GOP tax cuts." The tweet linked to a Washington Examiner article that in turn cited research by Americans for Tax Reform, a group supportive of the tax cut. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This isn’t the first time the White House has relied on Americans for Tax Reform for evidence of real-world impacts from passage of the tax bill. Previously, we looked at Trump’s statement that "since we passed tax cuts, over 3 million workers have gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars." That talking point, gleaned from the group’s research, rated Mostly True. The energy rate-cut list — which is a sub-list of the broader one we checked previously — attracted the White House’s attention not long after it hit its 100th item. For the utilities on the group's list that provided an estimate of savings per customer, most said rate-payers would save about $1 to $4 on their bill per month. Americans for Tax Reform cited a large number of company news releases and news articles, so we don’t quarrel with the number (which had already grown to 102 a day later). That said, we will provide some additional information that helps put the list in fuller context. It shouldn’t be surprising to see a lot of investor-owned utilities lowering rates after the corporate tax reduction. And it also shouldn’t be surprising that the companies specifically cited the tax changes as the reason for the rate cut. In most cases, experts said, utilities would have been required to do so by their regulators. The tax law has an impact on privately owned utilities — often called "investor-owned utilities," or IOUs for short — but not on public utilities. Investor-owned utilities pay corporate taxes, so the tax law’s lowering of the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent should save this type of utility a substantial amount of money. By contrast, publicly held utilities do not pay corporate taxes, so they are unaffected by this provision of the tax bill. Public utilities include rural electric cooperatives, municipally owned utilities, and federal or state power authorities. Among electricity utilities, about two-thirds of Americans are served by investor-owned utilities, while about a third receive their power from public utilities. For water utilities, a few of which appear on the group's list, public utilities are dominant. So while 101 utilities cutting their rates may seem like a large number, your ability to benefit from a rate cut depends on which utilities happen to serve your area. It’s also worth pointing out that many of these rate cuts were preordained by existing energy regulations. "Utilities are natural monopolies, and because of that, they’ve been regulated for well over 100 years," said Manny Teodoro, a political scientist at Texas A&M University who has studied energy issues. "It’s a recognition that a pure monopoly will result in a lack of competition and abusive pricing." For that reason, under longstanding regulations, utilities need to go back to energy regulatory bodies whenever they seek to modify their rates, in order to provide reasons for the change. And if a utility happens to benefit from a tax change, there’s a good chance it will be required under existing regulations to lower their rates to account for that. "Rates are set by public utility commissions through rate-making processes that would clearly identify the reasons for the rate change, up or down," said Billy Pizer, a Duke University public policy professor who studies energy. This doesn’t undercut the larger point of the tally, but it does suggest that the rate cuts required two elements to materialize — the tax cut, which Trump touted, and the longstanding regulations that require companies to share the tax gains with ratepayers rather than just with shareholders. And the latter is an aspect Trump didn’t get into. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "101 utilities cut rates, credit GOP tax cuts." The list comes from a organization that strongly supported the tax bill. The tally of rate cuts is well-documented, and the group acknowledges that it is not comprehensive. That said, it’s worth noting that public utility customers will not see the same types of rate cuts cited in the list, which is about one-third of Americans. Trump’s tweet seeks full credit for the tax law, while glossing over the role of energy regulations that mandate that utility savings be passed along to customers. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-01947	Says Barack Obama said that "ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs" and that individuals should "surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/23/chain-email/video-barack-obama-speech-circulating-internet-was/	A reader recently asked us to look at a YouTube video clip of President Barack Obama that puzzled them. The chain email that included the link to the video said, "You may not believe this 20 second sound bite. I had to listen to it twice ... to be sure that I heard what I thought I had heard. This is the most amazing statement ever uttered by Obama, or by any American." The brief video showed Obama giving a speech in which he said, "And for the international order that we have worked for generations to build, ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign." The YouTube video originated with a group from Germany that appears to dabble in conspiracy theories, including a focus on the "new world order" -- the notion of an emerging, worldwide, totalitarian government. Translated into English, the YouTube video is titled, "Obama explains the new world order 2014 in short ^^ – montage." It had received more than 88,000 views through June 20. It’s unclear whether the video was posted seriously or in jest by the German group; the emoticon "^^" sometimes communicates sarcasm. Still, that doesn’t play into our fact-check, because what we’re checking here is how the video circulated in English in the United States -- where there was no indication that it was intended as satire. We tracked down the speech Obama was giving. It was an address to European youth at the Palais des Beaux Arts in Brussels on March 26, 2014. But while the clip comes from a genuine White House video, it has been edited to make an entirely different point than the one Obama was making. Here’s the actual context of Obama’s comments: Leaders and dignitaries of the European Union; representatives of our NATO Alliance; distinguished guests: We meet here at a moment of testing for Europe and the United States, and for the international order that we have worked for generations to build. Throughout human history, societies have grappled with fundamental questions of how to organize themselves, the proper relationship between the individual and the state, the best means to resolve inevitable conflicts between states. And it was here in Europe, through centuries of struggle -- through war and Enlightenment, repression and revolution -- that a particular set of ideals began to emerge: The belief that through conscience and free will, each of us has the right to live as we choose. The belief that power is derived from the consent of the governed, and that laws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding. And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that all men -- and women -- are created equal. But those ideals have also been tested -- here in Europe and around the world. Those ideals have often been threatened by an older, more traditional view of power. This alternative vision argues that ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign. Often, this alternative vision roots itself in the notion that by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, some are inherently superior to others, and that individual identity must be defined by "us" versus "them," or that national greatness must flow not by what a people stand for, but by what they are against. In other words, the creator of the video slyly spliced together two separate passages of Obama’s speech during a cut-away shot -- in a way that totally changes the meaning. Obama wasn’t saying that "ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs" or that individuals should "surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign." Rather, he was saying that those two sentiments run counter to the ideals of free will and democracy. Our ruling The chain email claims that Obama said that "ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs" and that individuals should "surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign." Those are two separate thoughts from an actual speech, spliced together through video editing in a way that twists Obama’s argument beyond recognition.

pomt-02277	"More than 3 million young adults ... have gained insurance under (the Affordable Care Act) by staying on their family’s plan."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/07/barack-obama/obama-says-more-3-million-young-adults-got-health-/	President Barack Obama touted the success of the Affordable Care Act after 7 million people enrolled in coverage on the marketplaces by the March 31 deadline. "Despite several lost weeks out of the gate because of problems with the website, 7.1 million Americans have now signed up for private insurance plans through these marketplaces," he said in an April 1 address from the Rose Garden. "7.1 million, that’s on top of the more than 3 million young adults who have gained insurance under this law by staying on their family’s plan." Since Sept. 23, 2010, young adults have been able to stay on their families’ private insurance plans until they turn 26. PolitiFact wanted to see for ourselves if 3 million people, a number we’ve seen disputed, have really benefited from that change. The White House pointed us to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services June 2012 report for the source of Obama’s number. Between September 2010 and December 2011, the percentage of 19- to 25-year-olds on their families’ insurance increased from 64.4 percent to 74.8 percent, according to the National Health Interview Survey. HSS then took that increase of 10.4 percentage points and multiplied it by the number of people in that age group, which, according to Census data, was 29.7 million in 2010, to arrive at nearly 3.1 million newly insured people. Their estimate is two years old and hasn’t been updated, though they say they it will be going forward. The administration’s calculation isn’t the only method you could use to evaluate the impact of the law’s increased coverage for young adults. Forbes opinion editor Avik Roy, a former Mitt Romney adviser and Obamacare critic, took down the 3.1 million figure and estimated that the true number is more like 930,000. Factors that affect the estimate include: The starting point for counting uninsured young adults, and whether that is pre-recession The data set used for counting uninsured young adults The year the estimate was last updated Others have questioned Obama’s estimate as well. Our fact-checking colleague Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post published his own estimate of 2.2 million people, after using updated National Health Interview Surveys and also averaging 2010 figures instead of cherrypicking the third quarter, the year’s low point for uninsured young adults. Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee health care law professor who supports the law, said more than 3 million might be a high estimate, but Roy’s is too low. Again, he acknowledged that there are a number of different ways to arrive at the estimate, but his best guess is 2.5 million. Everyone agreed that the number of young adults covered definitely increased as a result of the law. But there’s no telling by exactly how much. Our ruling Obama said more than 3 million adults aged 19 to 25 got health coverage as a result of an Affordable Care Act mandate that allows those individuals to remain on their families’ private plans. There’s no way to get an exact figure, and estimates range anywhere from less than 1 million to 3.1 million. Obama’s estimate may be quite high, but his point that the law’s mandate has increased coverage in that age range is spot on. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-12401	"In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap. So basically spring break."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/may/25/samantha-bee/samantha-bee-says-buying-weed-tampering-odometer-o/	Comedian Samantha Bee traveled to Florida, where she says "retirees and democracy go to die," to shed light on how the state makes it difficult for felons to regain the right to vote. On her TBS show Full Frontal on May 10, Bee spotlighted efforts by advocates to collect about 700,000 signatures to place a question on the 2018 ballot. The amendment, which would have to pass by 60 percent to be enacted, calls for restoring voting rights for felons automatically for those who have fully completed their sentences including parole or probation. That would not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses who would still have to ask the Cabinet to restore their rights, a process which is currently slow and cumbersome. In Florida, about 1.7 million felons have lost their right to vote. Bee portrayed some of those felonies as not so serious. "In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap," Bee said. "So basically spring break." Bee’s big point: Felons in Florida aren’t just axe murderers. We will fact-check if the crimes Bee cited are felonies. A spokesman for Bee declined to comment on the record. Florida’s slow process to restore felons rights is an outlier Under the Florida Constitution, a convicted felon cannot vote, serve on a jury, or hold public office until civil rights have been restored. The policy stems back to the Jim Crow era. And that doesn’t only apply to violent offenses, said Randall Berg of the Florida Justice Institute. "Any felony conviction in Florida, no matter how small or seemingly trivial, results in the loss of your civil rights," Berg said. There have been efforts on and off since the 1970s to make the process easier. But in 2011, Gov. Rick Scott and the members of the Florida Cabinet decided to make the process more cumbersome and set a minimum five-year waiting period. Through April 1, 2017, about 2,600 felons have gotten their rights restored since 2011, while more than 10,000 cases are pending. Several types of crimes can be felonies in Florida Bee cited three statutes that are felonies in Florida: • 893.13 (2) (a) 2: This statute bans buying or possession with intent to sell drugs, including marijuana which is a third-degree felony. Possession of a small amount of cannabis -- less than 20 grams -- is a misdemeanor. • 319.35 (1) (a) tampering with an odometer: "It is unlawful for any person knowingly to tamper with, adjust, alter, set back, disconnect, or fail to connect an odometer of a motor vehicle, or to cause any of the foregoing to occur to an odometer of a motor vehicle, so as to reflect a lower mileage than the motor vehicle has actually been driven..." This is a third-degree felony. • 379.367 (4) disturbing a lobster trap: "It is unlawful for any person willfully to molest any spiny lobster traps, lines, or buoys belonging to another without permission of the license holder." This is a third-degree felony. While we were unable to find any data on how many people had lost their rights based on particular statutes, we did obtain conviction data for the statutes Bee cited from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Here are the convictions for those offenses between 2012 and 2016, which make up a tiny slice of all felony convictions in that period: • Buying or possessing marijuana: 398 felony convictions with specification of marijuana. • Messing with an odometer: 1 felony conviction • Disturbing a lobster trap: 4 felony convictions Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, pointed to national data for 2006 that showed about 18 percent of felony convictions in state courts were for violent offenses. The majority of convictions were drug and property offenses. "We tend to think of felonies as being represented in the prison population, but that's a skewed view that doesn't incorporate the more numerous people who are sentenced to some type of probation or community service," Mauer said. Bee interviewed one person who opposes automatic restoration of rights for felons generally: Roger Clegg, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. He has called for states to address restoration on a case-by-case basis. Clegg said that of course some crimes appear less serious than others, but the ones Bee cited are serious for the victims. For example, if someone sells a car that has 200,000 miles on it but has tampered with the odometer to show only 20,000 miles, that is cheating the buyer out of thousands of dollars. "You can ask someone who makes his or her living as a lobster fisherman if it’s a trivial matter if someone ‘molests’ (the statute’s word) his or her traps," he said. Our ruling Bee said, "In Florida felonies can be things like buying weed, tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap. So basically spring break." Bee is correct that these crimes are felonies on the books in Florida. Only a handful of felony convictions for tampering with an odometer or disturbing a lobster trap in recent years. The drug statute she cited resulted in about 400 felony convictions related to marijuana. For small amounts of marijuana, the crime is a misdemeanor.

pomt-08701	"Our most important work has been creating and retaining almost 55,000 Ohio jobs."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/07/kevin-boyce/ohio-treasurer-kevin-boyce-takes-credit-creating-a/	Spend any time with an Ohio politician running for office this year and you’ll hear one common theme: Jobs. The hard-working people of Ohio deserve jobs, they all say. Ohio Treasurer Kevin Boyce is no different. On many of the platforms available to him — his state website, his campaign literature, a YouTube video, Twitter — Boyce is talking about the jobs his office has supported. "Our most important work has been creating and retaining almost 55,000 Ohio jobs," he told supporters in an Aug. 19 e-mail. In a YouTube video his office released July 14 touting the treasurer’s accomplishments, he credited treasury programs like GrowNOW and the Ohio Enterprise Bond Fund. In recent weeks, the message has evolved, with Boyce or his supporters saying the treasury has "helped create and retain almost 60,000 Ohio jobs." That seemed like a lot of jobs for the state’s top banker to take credit for. The Ohio Treasurer, who is responsible for safeguarding and investing the state’s money, isn’t well-known for job creation and retention. So we asked Boyce’s office for evidence. Although Boyce referenced two treasury programs in the video, most of the jobs he is taking credit for actually are related to programs at other state agencies, such as the Department of Development. These programs involve infrastructure projects, small business loans and other initiatives that put people to work. In most cases, Boyce’s office simply helps fund the programs by issuing bonds. His office structures the debt, sells the bonds and hands the money over to the agencies administering the programs. It is Boyce’s duty as treasurer, according to state law, to issue bonds for these agencies. He does not play a direct role in actually spending the money in ways that create and retain jobs. He plays a more integral role, however, in the treasury programs he noted in the video, which account for 14,382 jobs. Boyce, a Democrat, is running to keep his job this November against state Rep. Josh Mandel, a Republican from Lyndhurst. Overall, Boyce’s office has carried out 21 bond issues totalling nearly $750 million since he took office in January 2009. Boyce updated the economic impact of the bond issues -- claiming 59,943 jobs created and retained -- in an Aug. 27 press release that included more recent statistics from the state agencies. Here’s how he added it up: Boyce counted both direct and indirect employment. Direct employment reflects actual jobs. Indirect employment is a projection based on the size of a given project or initiative. Take, for example, a highway renovation project that requires 50 construction workers. Those would be direct jobs. But the economic impact of hiring those workers is measured in indirect jobs — people employed by suppliers who provide materials to fix the highway, and people whose jobs are supported by consumer expenditures from wages paid on the highway project. Indirect jobs accounted for more than half of the jobs Boyce said he helped create and retain. Many of the indirect job numbers were estimates from small businesses seeking loans from the state’s Department of Development. A department spokeswoman said she was unsure how those businesses calculated the figures. Boyce defended his inclusion of indirect jobs in the Aug. 27 press release, which was distributed days after we began asking questions about his jobs claim. "Indirect job creation is just as valuable as direct," Boyce said in the press release. "This allows us to affect change in several industries and represents just how interrelated jobs sectors really are. A project that employs construction workers boosts both manufacturing and the retail of a local economy." The direct employment figures used in Boyce’s claim also carry inexactitudes. Let’s look at jobs traced back to $385 million in bonds the treasurer issued for the Ohio Department of Transportation, which used the money for infrastructure projects. ODOT told Boyce’s office those projects will result in 10,703 jobs, based on a mathematical formula that says $1 billion in infrastructure spending results in 27,800 jobs. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration last updated the formula in 2007. But the resulting number of jobs is merely an estimation that carries a list of qualifiers and caveats. First off, each of the 10,703 jobs is actually a "person-year." Here’s how the Federal Highway Administration explains the term: "One hundred person-years may translate into 50 jobs supported for two years or 100 jobs supported for one year." So the 10,703 jobs associated with ODOT’s money can only be expected to be kept for one year. Furthermore, the federal formula notes that two-thirds of the jobs are indirect jobs. Other state agencies for which Boyce issued bonds, such as the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Ohio Department of Mental Health, also used job projection formulas to estimate job creation and retention. ODOT spokesman Scott Varner said it is appropriate to include indirect jobs in an analysis of infrastructure investment. "That gives a better picture of the true return on investment," Varner said. "It is an estimation. That’s a number that will always be difficult to capture," Varner added. "It tries to give the best picture possible." Such a reliance on indirect employment, however, doesn’t paint an accurate picture for voters, said Zach Schiller, research director for Policy Matters Ohio, a liberal leaning, nonpartisan organization that focuses on economic policy. "From a perception standpoint, it’s not what people think it is," Schiller said. Government offices, however, use this type of math often to promote job creation and retention. Supporters of the Ohio Third Frontier initiative, which voters extended this May, included indirect employment when they proclaimed the program has created 48,000 jobs. "I would tend to be skeptical of job creation figures in general," Schiller said. When Ohio voters, some of whom are out of work, hear a candidate like Boyce take credit for bringing in new jobs and keeping existing jobs in their state, we doubt the concepts of indirect jobs and "person-years" enter their mind. His calculations give voters the wrong impression. Further, the significance of Boyce’s role in many of the job-creating state programs is questionable. While the bonds his office sells help fund the program, Boyce has no say in how those programs are run. He is more of a rubber stamp. We find significant exaggerations and mistakes in Boyce’s statement. To begin with, we think it’s a big leap for someone in his position to take credit for the job creation. It’s a major stretch to include in the indirect jobs. His methodology is suspect because many of the actual jobs would only be counted for one year. In addition, Boyce’s statement in the YouTube video is not accurate; the time frame is incorrect. He meant to frame his accomplishment from January 2009 to the present, not "in the past year." The evidence his office provided to support his claim dates back to January 2009, when he took office. Boyce’s campaign literature and Twitter feed also reference the longer time frame.

pomt-07804	Illegal immigration costs Georgia $2.4 billion a year	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/18/federation-american-immigration-reform/georgia-pols-use-report-push-immigration-reform/	Some strident critics of Georgia’s immigration policy have turned to what they hope will be the prevailing argument that sways state lawmakers to pass tougher policies this year. The almighty dollar. Georgia spends too much money, they say, on the estimated 425,000 illegal immigrants living in this state. And how much money does Georgia spend? One figure being passed around by supporters of two bills in the Legislature to tighten immigration guidelines is $2.4 billion. A Georgia tea party leader used the number at a recent state budget hearing. So has a U.S. congressman from Georgia. "We have the seventh-highest population, and it’s estimated that illegal immigration costs our state $2.4 billion annually," U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah, said in one news release. Kingston’s office said the cost estimate came from a report by the Washington-based Federation for American Immigration Reform. The 102-page report says it costs the state of Georgia and local officials $2.399 billion a year to assist illegal immigrants. That’s a substantial amount of money -- the entire state budget is about $18 billion. Few organizations dig into the annual cost of illegal immigration and offer estimates because it is such a slippery subject. But FAIR has consistently offered such estimates and has come under criticism for doing so. FAIR’s estimates are frequently used in the immigration debate, particularly those who support a crackdown. Founded in 1979, FAIR claims about 250,000 members and supporters. Its mission statement is to educate Americans on the impact of "sustained, high-volume immigration." FAIR estimates how much it costs local and state officials to educate, provide health care and offer other services to Georgia’s illegal immigrants. The estimate of 425,000 illegal immigrants in Georgia comes from the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan organization that conducts demographic research on Latinos. The Department of Homeland Security reports similar numbers, but even this estimate is a calculated guess. FAIR contends the biggest cost of illegal immigration -- more than 50 percent -- is education. The organization uses the average cost the state spends per pupil to educate children, which comes from the U.S. Department of Education. The most recent estimate we found is $10,597. FAIR’s per-pupil estimate is close, $10,907. FAIR believes there are 133,262 illegal immigrants in Georgia’s school system. But some experts on illegal immigration say there’s a major flaw in FAIR’s numbers. The organization includes U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. The U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship to any child born in this country. Still, FAIR believes it is appropriate to include these U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. "Our reasoning is that they would not be in the U.S. and a burden on the Georgia taxpayer if it were not for the illegal presence of their parents," said Jack Martin, who helped put the FAIR report together. Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, thinks using the average per-pupil cost also presents problems. Costs, he says, may vary by student. The second greatest cost, FAIR says, is medical care. The organization argues that because illegal immigrants aren’t eligible for taxpayer-funded health programs, they often rely on emergency care. For childbirth, that’s $10,000 per delivery. FAIR estimates that Georgia spends $317.6 million a year on medical care for illegal immigrants. The FAIR report also examines the potential economic contributions of illegal immigrants. FAIR contends illegal immigrants often work jobs that aren’t taxed. Georgia collects about $142 million a year in taxes from illegal immigrants, FAIR estimates. A Congressional Budget Office report reviewed 29 studies on the matter in 2007 and found tax revenue typically does not offset the costs to states and local government for illegal immigrants. In Colorado, for example, a 2006 study found that state received between 73 and 86 cents for every dollar it spent on education, Medicaid and prison time for illegal immigrants. The Internal Revenue Service estimates 6 million illegal immigrants -- about half the nation’s estimated illegal immigrant population -- paid some federal, state and local income taxes. The Social Security Administration estimates that half of illegal immigrants pay Social Security taxes. FAIR’s reports have become a bible of sorts for many frustrated with illegal immigration. Last year, Nathan Deal used a prior FAIR report to back up his claim during his successful candidacy for governor that "illegal aliens are costing Georgia taxpayers over a billion dollars every year." PolitiFact Georgia reviewed that claim in July and ruled it Half True. So where does all this information leave us? There’s strong evidence from several sources that illegal immigrants cost each state, including Georgia, massive sums of money. Studies show illegal immigrants use more money in state and local resources than they contribute. But the actual percentage is inconclusive. Georgians who want tougher policies to deter illegal immigration should be careful using FAIR’s estimate. It is not a precise number and includes the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. FAIR appears to be correct in its larger point that illegal immigration costs states such as Georgia large sums of money. But FAIR’s $2.4 billion estimate leaves out important details and in some cases takes things out of context. That meets our definition of Half True.

pomt-14563	Says Hillary Clinton "believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-hillary-clinton-supports-abortion/	Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who’s known for his strong anti-abortion views, said Hillary Clinton is the extremist when it comes abortion, not him. "Why doesn’t the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child," he said during the Feb. 6 Republican debate in New Hampshire. Is it true that Clinton "believes all abortions should be legal even on the due date"? The Rubio campaign didn’t get back to us. So we looked at comments Clinton made on the issue over the past 15 years. Clinton has said she could support restrictions on abortions in the third trimester (about week 28 of a pregnancy) if the mother’s life and health are taken into account. Rubio casts this position as the equivalent of supporting abortions on the due date, but that exaggerates Clinton’s position. Restricting late-term abortions Clinton responded to Rubio’s attack the morning after the debate, calling it "pretty pathetic." "I think that the life and health of the mother, obviously, rape and incest, have to be always taken into account," she said on ABC’s This Week. "And, you know, when he raises the very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons." We found many instances of Clinton saying abortion should be "safe, legal and rare." In short, Clinton is open to restrictions on late-term abortions provided there are exceptions for the life and health of the mother. This includes both mental health and medical complications like preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication of high blood pressure that could lead to death. We should note that those who want a total abortion ban — a position that Rubio has expressed — see exceptions made for rape, incest and health as loopholes that undermine late-term restrictions. Advocating for exceptions could theoretically encompass a due-date abortion, but Rubio’s conclusion that Clinton supports due-date abortions is not backed by evidence and logically unsound. Here’s a sampling of comments Clinton's made in the past: Sept. 28, 2015, Meet the Press Daily: "There can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester, but they have to take into account the life and health of the mother." June 4, 2007, Democratic presidential forum: "What I have tried to both talk about and reach out about over the last many years, going back, really, at least 15 years, in talking about abortion being safe, legal, and rare. And, by rare, I mean rare." Oct. 8, 2000, New York Senate debate: "I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I’ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it’s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman’s choice." When abortions can be performed According to the reproductive health nonprofit, the Guttmacher Institute, 20 states limit abortions after "viability" (which refers to the point when a fetus can survive out of the womb) and 23 states prohibit abortions between 20 and 28 weeks. Seven states and Washington D.C., have no time restrictions, but this doesn’t mean late-term abortions are common. In fact, only 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute. "People say we should place legal restrictions on abortion in the third trimester. The reality is the medical community is doing that in practice," said Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco and an advisor at Ibis Reproductive Health. "Third-trimester abortion is very uncommon." As for the scenario Rubio is suggesting — an abortion performed on the due date to save the life of the mother? It doesn’t exist. "Nobody would talk about abortion on the woman’s due date. If the mother’s life was at risk, the treatment for that is delivery, and the baby survives," Grossman said. "Medically, it does not compute." Our ruling Rubio said Clinton "believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child." Clinton does not believe that all abortion should be legal. Instead, she’s said she supports restrictions on late-term abortions except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother’s life and health are in danger. That’s not the same thing as unequivocally supporting abortions "even on the due date" of the child. Such an abortion would be a purely hypothetical scenario; doctors said such a procedure doesn't make sense medically.

pomt-05501	The U.S. Supreme Court has not traditionally asked a lot of questions during oral arguments.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/16/clarence-thomas/clarence-thomas-gives-supreme-court-history-lesson/	The U.S. Supreme Court’s least loquacious member had much to say -- more than any of his fellow justices, actually -- about a recent landmark hearing. Justice Clarence Thomas criticized some of his colleagues for asking too many questions during the three-day oral arguments held in late March on the federal government’s controversial health care law. A decision is expected in June. "I don’t see where that advances anything," Thomas, a Savannah-area native, said of the questions while he was speaking at the University of Kentucky. "Maybe it’s the Southerner in me. Maybe it’s the introvert in me, I don’t know. I think that when somebody’s talking, somebody ought to listen." Thomas, who’s been on the bench since 1991 and is known for rarely asking questions during oral arguments, went on. "I don’t like to badger people," the justice was quoted by The Associated Press. "These are not children. The court traditionally did not do that. I have been there 20 years. I see no need for all of that. Most of that is in the briefs, and there are a few questions around the edges." We wondered if Thomas was accurate when he argued that the Supreme Court didn’t "traditionally" ask many questions or "badger" lawyers arguing cases before them. Thomas wasn’t specific about the time frame he meant when he said "traditionally." A Supreme Court spokeswoman said she was unable to help us clarify because she did not have a transcript of Thomas’ remarks. The court’s online transcripts of oral arguments go back only to 2000, so we recognized it would be difficult to make an accurate comparison to cases dating back decades. Instead, PolitiFact Georgia talked to several Supreme Court experts to get their thoughts about the Thomas claim. They said Thomas has a good argument, but noted some changes over the years that must be considered to fully understand his statement. The court currently gives each side about 30 minutes to argue its case. In the court’s early days, oral arguments would sometimes last hours -- or days. In 1849, the court limited oral arguments to two hours per side. The court had larger caseloads and needed time to hear the additional cases. In 1925, the court contracted the time again, to one hour for each side. In 1970, the court cut the time limit again, to its present limit of 30 minutes for each side. "That was a function of them hearing so many cases," said Emory University political science professor Tom Clark, the author of a book on judicial independence. Clark was dubious of Thomas’ claim, saying the justice was "being a good politician" by not specifying what he meant by "traditionally" and not considering some of the context of changes in how the court operates. Timothy Johnson, a widely respected expert on Supreme Court oral arguments, also noted those changes to us via email. However, he thought Thomas was correct. "The justices [say in the 19th century] did not ask many questions. But this was during the time before briefs were filed. Rather, the arguments were more like the British system where all arguments were presented right in open court. Thus, without briefs the justices had to listen to find out the arguments rather than try to clarify them from the briefs or inject their own thoughts," said Johnson, a University of Minnesota law school professor who wrote a book in 2004 on Supreme Court oral arguments. Johnson also co-authored a 2009 study that explored whether the court gives hints of how the justices will rule on a case by the number of questions they ask each side. In general, they found, the side asked more questions typically loses. Johnson conducted research on how many times each justice spoke between 1998 and 2007. Thomas spoke 34 times, an average of less than four times a year. The next lowest on the list was Justice Samuel Alito, who spoke 816 times. Compare that to Justice Antonin Scalia, who spoke 18,122 times. Thomas has maintained the same rationale to explain why he doesn’t speak much during oral arguments. It’s rude, he says. Kathleen Burch, who teaches constitutional law at John Marshall Law School in Atlanta, said most of the justices "seem to want to jump in more" in the last 15 to 20 years. She guessed that is because more of them have served as appeals court judges, where they are more aggressive in questioning attorneys. Elena Kagan is the only current justice who did not serve as an appeals court judge. "I think historically it would be true," Burch, who has taught at John Marshall for nine years, said of Thomas’ statement. "I think it’s becoming more common to ask questions than be quiet." Thomas, the third-longest tenured justice on the court, is apparently old school. The experts we interviewed mostly agreed that it’s fair to say that justices ask more questions today than they did a century ago or as recently as 40 years ago. They note that changes such as being provided with briefs before oral arguments have made the justices better versed on cases beforehand -- and perhaps more likely to ask questions. We considered that a minor point that doesn’t change our impression of Thomas’ statement. Our rating: True.	None	Clarence Thomas	None	None	None	2012-04-16T06:00:00	2012-04-05	['None']

pomt-04381	As a Member of Congress, Chris Murphy "was raking in $1 million in salary."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/19/linda-mcmahon/linda-mcmahon-says-opponent-chris-murphy-was-rakin/	In an ad in the hard-fought U.S. Senate race in Connecticut, Republican Linda McMahon charges that her Democratic opponent, Rep. Chris Murphy, has been getting rich in Congress. The ad focuses on Social Security and Medicare, but it includes a momentary detour into how much Murphy got paid for his labors in the Capitol. The narrator asks, "Why is Congressman Chris Murphy lying to you about Linda McMahon and Social Security? Because while Murphy was raking in $1 million in salary, he voted to cut Medicare for current recipients by $716 billion." An on-screen visual reads: "Congressman Chris Murphy: $1 million in taxpayer-funded salary." A reader asked us: Are members of Congress really paid $1 million salaries? Actually, no. Not even close. Since Jan. 1, 2009, lawmakers have been paid $174,000 a year. The key to understanding the ad’s claim comes from the fine print on the screen. It says, "Congressional salaries 2007 through 2012." So the ad is referring to Murphy’s cumulative earnings over a six-year period and calling it his "salary." We checked a Congressional Research Service paper on lawmakers’ salaries and found that if you add up the salary earned by Murphy over the six-year period since he was elected to Congress, it does come to more than $1.03 million. "He’s been in Congress six years, and he’s cumulatively been paid $1 million dollars," said Todd Abrajano, communications director for the McMahon campaign. "It’s pretty clear and straightforward." But in our view, that’s a ridiculous way of calculating "salary," which is defined as "a fixed regular payment, typically paid on a monthly or biweekly basis but often expressed as an annual sum." The tremendous distortion of this claim is that it adds up multiple years and uses a terminology that suggests it is for one year. Using their logic, we would say the median household income in the United States is more than $300,000. (The median household earned just over $50,000 in 2011, according to the Census Bureau.) Our ruling The method for calculating Murphy’s salary was disclosed on the screen, but it is in such small type -- and it was calculated in such an unorthodox way -- that the explanation is greatly outweighed by the narration and the visuals. We’ve never heard of anyone refer to their "salary" as six cumulative years of earnings. By phrasing it this way, the ad is pulling a fast one. We rate the statement False.

pomt-05982	Says the D.C. city council passed a law banning lethal rat trapping.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2012/jan/23/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-dc-council-has-banned-lethal-trapp/	Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli smells a rat. He is outraged by a law passed by the District of Columbia’s city council in 2010 that regulates how exterminating companies capture pests. Cuccinelli, a Republican, has been sharply critical of the Occupy movement, an international grassroots protest largely directed at corporate power. During two recent interviews, Cuccinelli has discussed published reports about an increase in rat populations around Occupy DC camps a few blocks from the White House. Then he’s turned to the D.C. pest-control law and painted it as an example of ridiculous regulation. The D.C. law "doesn’t allow them to kill the dang rats," Cuccinelli said in a Jan. 13 interview with CNSNews.com, a conservative web site. "They have to capture them, and capture them in families." Cuccinelli said the law requires relocation of the trapped rats and voiced concern that D.C. exterminators would transport vermin across the Potomac River and set them free in Virginia. As a last case resort, he said, the law allows euthanizing pests. Cuccinelli took a similar swipe at the law in a Jan. 10 interview on WMAL radio. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh picked up on Cuccinelli’s comments and pilloried the statute and its author - D.C. Councilwoman Mary Cheh. We were curious whether D.C. really does require rats to be captured by non-lethal means. So we scurried for an answer. The seven-page law cited by Cuccinelli does prohibit pest control companies operating in DC from using various traps to catch some kinds of urban wildlife such as raccoons, possums and skunks. In these cases, it forbids pest control companies from setting traps using glue, snares, leg holds, harpoon, and body crushing devices. The law also calls for catching animals alive and relocating whole pest families when possible. Though "non-lethal means" is listed in the law as the preferred way for dealing with city wildlife, it does allow for euthanasia techniques based on recommendations from the American Veterinary Medical Association. But here’s the catch: The pardon does not extend to rats in D.C. Kiara Pesante, Cheh’s director of communications, noted that the first page of the law specifically exempts "commensal rodents" -- common rats and mice that pilfer human food. So it seemed that Cuccinelli got it wrong. We called his office for an explanation. Brian J. Gottstein, Cuccinelli’s director of communications, acknowledged the law exempts some rats and mice species, but stressed it would still regulate trapping other "non-commensal" rodents, including the rice rat and the deer mouse. We spoke to officials at the National Pest Management Association, the Humane Society of the United States and the D.C. Department of Health. They all said they are not aware of rice rats existing in Washington. Wikipedia says the rice rat dwells in wetlands through most of the eastern U.S. There are deer mice, and during colder months they do get into homes in leafy areas around the capital, such as Rock Creek Park. But a deer mouse is not a rat. In his comments to CNSNews.com, Cuccinelli talked about rats and made no distinction among them. He said the law calls for live trapping of "these rats" while discussing vermin populations around the Occupy D.C. camps. "The rat that we find in D.C. is indeed the Norway rat," said Najma Roberts, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Health. The Norway rat is a commensal rodent and the critters are not protected by D.C. law. Our ruling: Cuccinelli said a D.C. law passed in 2010 forbids lethal trapping of rats. But the law doesn’t pertain to the common type of rat living in the nation’s capital. That particular vermin, the Norway rat, can still be caught using lethal means. Cuccinelli’s spokesman said the law would still regulate catching another type of rat - the rice rat. But there’s no evidence those rats exist in the city. The attorney general made no distinction among rats in his comments. We think most listeners would conclude from his comments that the D.C. council by and large has repealed the death penalty for rats. That’s wrong and ridiculous.

pomt-08181	Wisconsin’s projected state budget shortfall is now as low as $1.5 billion	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/29/jim-doyle/gov-jim-doyle-says-wisconsins-projected-budget-sho/	It’s a familiar scenario when it comes to the politics around government budgets. New to office? Puff up the size of the deficit you inherited, so you look like a hero tackling the problem. Running for re-election or riding off into retirement? Push those numbers as low as you can, so the citizenry doesn’t hold you responsible for it -- and let the next guy deal with all the fallout. Eight years ago, it was incoming Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, complaining that outgoing Republican Scott McCallum had made the state budget picture a little too rosy. Now Doyle, who did not to seek a third term, has issued his administration’s official budget statement. It showed a deficit as low as $1.5 billion. That’s a far, far cry from the $2.7 billion or so deficit bandied about during the November election, won by Republican Scott Walker. And Doyle is facing a hailstorm of criticism from Republicans for playing the how-low-can-you-go game. "Even on his way out, Jim Doyle continues to use Madison math to manipulate budget numbers," soon-to-be Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald said after the Nov. 19, 2010 announcement. Of course, Doyle’s top administrators are fighting back. They say Walker and his fellow Republicans are hypocritically inflating the deficit number to more than $3.3 billion. Let’s dig into the numbers, with a focus on those issued by Doyle’s administration because they are the official ones. Having a realistic number is important. The deficit -- and what Walker and the new Republican-controlled Legislature do about it -- could affect everything from school spending levels to government jobs, tax rates and the state’s safety net for the poor. At the center of the issue is the statutorily required biennial report by the state Department of Administration. That report, dated Nov. 19, projected the two-year budget shortfall at $1.5 billion by June 2013, with the caveat it could be $2.2 billion if two key assumptions went awry. That number was much lower than the $2.7 billion estimate in July by the state’s Legislative Fiscal Bureau. But lay that aside. While useful for an overall feel of fiscal condition, the Fiscal Bureau report measures an entirely different number than the new document. So let’s look at how Doyle’s accounting squares with reality. First of all, the deficit projection is just that -- a best guess based mainly on predicted tax collections vs. the amount state agencies say they need to operate. State law says the deficit report should not include the recommendations by the governor, in this case the incoming Walker. Those recommendations are supposed to come later, during budget time. As such, the report is meant to strictly be a measure of the best estimate today of where things stand for the next two budget years. But Doyle’s administrators put his stamp squarely on it, "reducing" the deficit by $800 million -- even before the $700 million in iffy assumptions are factored in. Doyle did so by assuming Walker would continue several cost-saving measures Doyle used to balance the last two-year budget. Those measures included furloughs, a roll-back of a 2 percent pay raise and across-the-board spending cuts. Asked about this approach, Department of Administration spokeswoman Emily Winecke told PolitiFact Wisconsin: "Because Governor-elect Walker has repeatedly supported these measures, we did not feel they needed to be added as a likely additional cost." To be sure, a governor has authority on his own to enact many of the personnel and spending cuts. And Walker, as county executive, used furloughs and similar moves to balance the Milwaukee County budget. But Doyle will be gone long before the budget is introduced. An independent researcher who has studied the deficit, University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Andrew Reschovsky, said the DOA report obscured the real size of the problem by incorporating solutions into the mix -- solutions that Walker may or may not pursue. "You have to go back to the status quo -- before furloughs -- to see what the magnitude of the problem is," Reschovsky said. Reschovsky issued his own estimate in September pegging the deficit at $3.1 billion, though he says it would be under $3 billion if he did it today. Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said it was unusual for an administration to carry over previous cost savings when calculating a future deficit. Indeed, if one were to assume enough cost savings, a deficit could become a surplus. There are other problems built into Doyle’s report: It counts on $528 million in additional federal Medicaid payments. But that assumes Congress and the president will extend help they first granted in the 2009 stimulus action. That’s iffy, as the report itself notes. Another $200 million hanging over the state’s head was not accounted for at all -- the likely repayment of a transfer from the state’s patient compensation fund that was invalidated by the courts. Still another $300 million in "savings" came from unspecified cuts in the Department of Health Services. DOA argues the agency found efficiencies in the last budget equalling hundreds of millions of dollars in a budget of over $5 billion. What’s the bottom line? Even Department of Administration Secretary Daniel Schooff, who signed the deficit report, says $2.2 billion -- not $1.5 billion -- is the best starting point because the Medicaid and patient fund monies likely will fall to the state to cover. Doyle’s side argues the deficit reports always have reflected some decision-making by the incumbent governor, even when he’s leaving office. State agencies, for instance, often are instructed to come in with zero percent increases in state general funds. Doyle did that this time around. Doyle’s camp argues that his incorporation of various yet-to-be-approved cuts -- not just freezes -- is an extension of that approach. "The real ‘Madison math’ is the assumption that state agency budgets can only go up and not down," Schooff said in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin. In fact, Berry of Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance was faulting Doyle just two years ago for using inflated agency requests to pump up the size of a predicted deficit. Now Doyle is under attack in part because his agency requests are too slim. But the scenario here is different: It is one thing to assume changes when you wrote the current budget and will be creating the new one. It’s another to presume your successor and others -- in this case, Congress -- will do certain things. Where does that leave us? With less than two months left in the term, Gov. Jim Doyle’s administration department released a report showing a $1.5 billion deficit for the next two-year budget cycle. Although that number is official, the agency’s chief -- noting caveats included in the report -- almost immediately began portraying the actual deficit as closer to $2.2 billion. In constructing the official number, the report makes an $800 million assumption -- it counts as continued savings cuts that are really decisions for the new governor. It also counts on an iffy $500 million in federal cash and skates over $200 million the courts say the state owes to one of its funds. Here’s our official rating: False.

pomt-02292	Says the estate tax is a threat to family farms.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/03/kentucky-opportunity-coalition/pro-mcconnell-group-says-estate-tax-makes-it-hard-/	A group aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is airing a new ad in Kentucky that touts the Republican leader as a friend of farmers. The new 30-second spot, which began airing April 1, 2014, is part of a $1.8 million ad buy from the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, which hopes to boost McConnell as he enters a primary challenge and re-election battle. It features a farmer who laments the impact of the "death tax," known officially as the estate tax, on family farms. "As a farmer there’s good years and bad," he says. "The last thing we need is Washington making it harder on us. The death tax makes it harder for us to hand our farm on to our kids. Mitch McConnell has been fighting to end the death tax to help us keep our Kentucky family farms. For our family farms to survive, we’ve got to get in this fight." McConnell (like many Republicans) is a staunch opponent of the estate tax, a tax on property transferred after death through an inheritance. It’s mostly viewed as a tax on wealthier individuals, but the pro-McConnell ad claims it threatens "Kentucky family farms" as well. Is that true? Recent history of the estate tax The estate tax was first established in 1916 to offset a decline in tariff revenue caused by the first World War, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Congress has tinkered with it many times throughout the years, especially during the past decade or so. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed legislation that created an exemption for the first $1.5 million of an inherited estate. The exemption increased for the next few years to $3.5 million with the intention of eliminating the estate tax completely in 2010. But the law was scheduled to sunset in 2011, along with the rest of the so-called Bush tax cuts. In 2010, Congress and President Barack Obama agreed to extend the Bush-era tax rates by two years, while also raising the exemption on the estate tax to $5 million in 2010 and indexing it to inflation for 2011 and 2012. Income after $5 million was taxed at 35 percent. In 2012, Congress and Obama compromised to keep the estate tax above $5 million but increased the tax rate to 40 percent. That’s where it sits today. You can see why this is viewed as a tax on the wealthy. The vast majority of Americans do not pass along estates to their children after death valued at greater than $1.5 million, let alone $5 million. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, in 2011 the top 1 percent of earners paid almost 80 percent of the estate taxes collected; the top 5 percent paid 97.6 percent. The small percentage who do pay the tax, however, face a stiff fee. The 3,200 estates with taxable returns in 2011 paid a combined $10.6 billion. Where do farmers fit in? Republicans and opponents of the estate tax have often held up farmers as an example of a population especially burdened by this levy. Because many farmers own a lot of land and expensive machinery, the values of their estate can add up quickly, they say, but many don’t have the money to pay the high tax and could risk losing their farm. Estimates, however, say that just a small percentage of farmers are actually affected by the tax. A 2005 study from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that if the exemption were set at $3.5 million in 2000, only 65 of the 4,640 farm estates filing returns that year would have surpassed the threshold needed to pay the estate tax. Of those, just 13 wouldn’t have enough money to pay their tax liability. More recently, the Tax Policy Center estimated that in 2011, with the exemption at $5 million, 120 farms and small businesses would have to pay the estate tax. Their total taxes paid equated to about 6.3 percent of all estate taxes collected that year. About 40 of these filings came from "small farms or businesses," according to the analysis. Congress has built in a number of provisions throughout the years to assist farmers. For example, the exemption doubles if the farm is owned by a couple, even if one of the owners dies. "The idea that if you’re married now you’re approaching $10 million, that’s a pretty hefty farm," said Bob Williams at the Tax Policy Center. There is also an exemption that allows closely held family farms a reduction of up to $1.5 million to bridge the gap between the value of their property at the "current use value" versus the "highest and best use value." If a farm does qualify for the estate tax, heirs also have 15 years to pay the tax. But taking advantage of these provisions comes at a price, said Don Williamson, executive director of the American University Kogod Tax Center, not the least of which is the cost of accountants and lawyers who understand the complexities of estate planning. Individuals that take advantage of certain provisions for closely held family farms also have to hold onto to the property for 10 years and use it for farming purposes. During that time the IRS places a lien on the property that makes it difficult to take out loans, said Williamson, who through his private practice has handled estate planning for farmers. Farms close to urban hubs are especially at risk of seeing large increases in the property value when compared to their value as a farm, Williamson added. Ongoing battle on the Hill In his most recent budget, Obama called on Congress to return the estate tax to 2009 levels when the exemption was $3.5 million and the tax rate was 45 percent. Obama’s administration said the country can no longer afford to keep the exemption at $5 million and the rate at 40 percent. However, it is unlikely Republicans who control the House are willing to renegotiate the terms of the 2012 compromise and increase the reach and the rates of the estate tax. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., has introduced a measure to eliminate the estate tax entirely. McConnell supports that idea, but it's equally unlikely to move forward. Ed Koren, a wealth and estate lawyer and an adjunct professor at the University of Miami Heckerling Estate Planning Institute, said where the exemption falls will ultimately determine how many farmers are affected. "Certainly if compared to those who would like to take it back to the way it was in 2000, it’s absolutely true (that farmers are threatened), even if you take it back to what the Obama budget proposal has said, there’s some truth to it," Koren said. "But it’s not that big of an issue if you keep the law where it’s at today." Our ruling The Kentucky Opportunity Coalition ad said the estate tax is a threat to family farms. If the exemption levels are changed, more farmers could be affected. Bureaucratic and accounting hurdles to avoid the tax can be difficult to navigate without assistance. But most of the statistical evidence says that the vast majority of farms bequeathed to relatives don’t pay any estate taxes at the current exemption level. Even fewer are in a position where they can’t pay the liability. And there are provisions that make the payment process easier for farmers than other estate holders. Further, the estate tax generally most affects the very wealthy. Nearly 98 percent is paid by the top 5 percent of earners.

pomt-12063	The Clinton Foundation is sending water to Houston "for $7 a bottle."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/06/ourlandofthefreecom/no-clinton-foundation-not-charging-7-water-bottle-/	It’s not true that the Clinton Foundation is providing water to Houston hurricane survivors at $7 per bottle. That’s fake news. An Aug. 30 post on OurLandofTheFree.com claimed the foundation "is using an outdated rule for non-profits" that would allow it "to compete in the free market regardless of who the competition is.’" The headline says, "Clinton Foundations (sic) sends water to Houston…for $7 a bottle." The post claims that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is under contract to pay for water and other items "due to Obama era rules that give special consideration to ‘compassionate liberals’ who own non-profits." The website also said the Clintons stand to funnel to themselves hundreds of millions of dollars that would come through the foundation for flood relief. But posts on OurLandofTheFree.com should not be taken as serious reporting. The website’s About Us page says, "All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they’re not. It’s not you, it’s me." The Clinton Foundation, founded by former President Bill Clinton, also refuted the post’s claims. "This story is totally fabricated. We have encouraged people to donate to relief efforts on the ground. Nothing in this story is true," said Brian Cookstra, Clinton Foundation spokesman. In an Aug. 28 Medium post, the Clinton Foundation published a list of members of the foundation's community who are providing relief to survivors of Hurricane Harvey. Those organizations include the American Red Cross, Houston Food Bank and Americares, which the foundation said has responded to requests for water and medications. The Clinton Foundation is an international humanitarian charity that came under scrutiny by Hillary Clinton opponents during the 2016 presidential campaign. (PolitiFact fact-checked several claims related to the foundation and how it compares to the Trump Foundation.) Bill Clinton has supported national relief efforts in the past, but that was done through separate partnerships. For instance, he worked with former President George H.W. Bush to create a charity, the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, to help survivors of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. A claim from OurLandofTheFree.com that the Clinton Foundation is charging $7 per bottle of water sent to Houston after Hurricane Harvey is made up. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-00989	"The Obama administration is refusing to directly arm the Kurds."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/08/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-obama-refuses-directly-arm-kurds-isi/	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said that arming the Iraqi Kurds is key in the fight against the Islamic State -- but the United States isn’t doing enough in that regard. On NBC’s Meet the Press Feb. 8, Secretary of State John Kerry defended the United States’ current policy regarding the Kurds -- an ethnic group partially located in northern Iraq, in and around cities under Islamic State control. "We have supplied (the Kurds) with enormous amount of ammunition, weapons, other things. And others are supplying them," he said. Cruz characterized the situation differently. "What makes no sense whatsoever is the Obama administration is refusing to directly arm the Kurds," he said the same day on CNN's State of the Union. "We need to arm the Kurds now because they are our boots on the ground." Later he said, "But we're not seeing leadership from the administration to get that done. Instead, they continue to send weaponry to Baghdad, who doesn't pass it onto the Peshmerga (the Kurdish military), and it doesn't get put to use effectively." With Kerry touting how much military aid the administration is providing, we wondered how Cruz’s claim that they are "refusing to directly arm the Kurds" stacks up. The key word in Cruz’s claim is "directly." The United States is in fact sending arms and military assistance intended for the Kurds. However, it has to go through the Iraqi government, and some see that as a road block. Direct vs. indirect To make sense of this debate, it’s crucial to understand that the Kurds are a semi-autonomous group. They clash with the Iraqi government in Baghdad because the Kurds -- along with Kurds in Iran, Turkey and Syria -- would like to be an independent nation. Leaders in Baghdad and the United States want Iraq to keep its current borders. However, cooperation between the Iraqi government and the Iraqi Kurds has appeared to improve recently due to the joint goal of defeating the Islamic State. The Iraqi government and the Kurds also recently reached a deal temporarily ending a dispute over oil in the Kurdish region. This recent interactive map out of Britain’s Financial Times shows locations of the Islamic State, Kurds and other Iraqi factions. A State Department official told us that the United States has so far transported more than 3 million pounds of equipment to Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish Regional Government. These shipments have included: over 15,000 hand grenades, nearly 40 million rounds of machine gun ammunition, 18,000 assault rifles, 45,000 mortar rounds, 40,000 RPG rounds and 2,800 RPG launchers. The United States has also been training Kurdish forces and conducting air strikes on their behalf. However, because the Kurds are not a fully independent nation, the United States must coordinate these transfers through the Iraqi government in Baghdad. It’s not that they’re refusing to directly arm the Kurds, as Cruz says, though. It’s the law, required by the Foreign Assistance Act and the Arms Export Control Act. Additionally, the United Nations prohibits transferring arms to Iraq other than on terms agreed to by the Iraqi government. The State Department told us that the Iraqi government has approved all shipments and has even provided its own weapons to the Kurds. But Cruz and others argue that this plan hasn’t achieved its intended goal because the Iraqi government withholds much of the military assistance. Quite a few Kurds have reported that they don’t have enough weapons, or they simply haven’t received the weapons the United States promised. "We are starting to have doubts that there might be a political decision on what sort of equipment should be given to the Kurds," Masrour Barzani, chancellor of the Kurdistan Region Security Council, told Bloomberg’s Eli Lake. "We don’t think this is just a technical issue. It’s been way too long for any technical issue." Lake noted that the State Department disputed this characterization. Based on recent conversations with Kurdish sources, Michael Gunter, a professor at Tennessee Tech University, said it’s true that the Iraqi government has stalled American weapons shipments intended for the Kurds. Gunter has written several books about the Kurds and visited the region in September. He noted that there’s not much the United States could do legally to step over the Iraqi government and give weapons directly to the Kurds. That is, other than transferring the weapons covertly, which Gunter believes is already happening. For the record, the CIA declined to comment for this story, but there are reports that the agency is providing arms. Given their strategic location and reputation as relatively moderate Muslims, the Iraqi Kurds have significant advantages in the fight against the Islamic State. So why might the Iraqi government not want the Kurds to have these weapons? Gunter said Iraq is mainly concerned with making sure that the Kurds don’t break away. So they give the Kurds just enough weapons to get by, but not so much that they would be able to later turn against the Iraqi government. The United States faces a similar problem when considering how hard to pressure Iraq to ensure the weapons intended for the Kurds make it there. "To one extent, we want to give the Kurds more weapons so they can fight ISIS, but if we give them too many weapons it, might break up Iraq or make the government even more mad at us," Gunter said. "It’s almost a catch-22 situation." Our ruling Cruz said, "the Obama administration is refusing to directly arm the Kurds." The administration has sent a significant amount of arms and other aid to the Iraqi Kurds to assist in the fight against the Islamic State. However, Cruz is right to say that this aid is indirect -- it has to go through the Iraqi government under current law. While the administration insists that this process works, policymakers like Cruz, as well as Kurds and an expert with knowledge of the situation on the ground, have said that the Iraqi government has stopped some of these weapons from reaching their intended destinations. Cruz might have been better off not using the word "refusing," however. There are domestic laws and United Nations regulations -- as well as diplomatic considerations -- preventing the United States from directly arming the Kurds. Cruz’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2015-02-08T17:18:37	2015-02-08	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-13473	Say "71 percent of doctors say Hillary's health concerns are 'serious' and 'could be disqualifying.' "	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/12/blog-posting/bloggers-hype-hillary-clinton-health-poll-represen/	Hillary's Clinton's physician said she's in good overall health, but that hasn't quelled speculation on the internet and elsewhere about the fitness of the Democratic nominee for president. That speculation was reinvigorated Sept. 11, 2016, when Clinton faltered while prematurely leaving a public event and her campaign revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier. In most cases, pneumonia is a short-term health problem. But on Sept. 8, three days before that illness came to light, a series of headlines surfaced on the Drudge Report, InfoWars and other conservative-leaning sites which typically reported that "71 percent of doctors say Hillary's health concerns are 'serious' and 'could be disqualifying.'" The sites used words like "Bombshell poll" and "Shock Poll!" At first blush, that sounds like a strong physician consensus. As it turns out, it's not 71 percent of doctors at all. It's 71 percent of doctors on the email list of a small conservative/libertarian medical group. In our previous reporting on the health of both Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, we’ve noted the folly of trying to diagnose a candidate's physical or mental health without actually examining that candidate. In mental health circles, it's considered unethical. The poll being cited by the bloggers is based on a two-day online survey begun Sept. 5 by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a Tucson-based organization with a largely conservative or libertarian membership that's concerned about the intrusion of government into medicine. The AAPS spent decades trying to block the implementation of Medicare, according to documentation on its website, and it opposes Obamacare. It has publicized the discredited ideas that vaccines can cause autism and abortion increases the risk of breast cancer. The group claims about 5,000 members. To give that some perspective, the American Medical Association, the nation's largest, reported 224,503 members in 2012. When we contacted AAPS, executive director Dr. Jane Orient and the group's webmaster and business manager, Jeremy Snavely, said the email invitation to participate in the Survey Monkey poll went to 3,700 known physicians on its email list. The email was opened by 1,050 people; 250 responded during the two-day window. Orient said the six-question survey was simply designed to see how its members felt about allegations made about Clinton's health. It was not an attempt to survey a representative sample of physicians, which would have been prohibitively expensive, she said. In response to the second question, 91 percent said they were aware "of questions raised about the impact of past and current medical conditions on Hillary Clinton's fitness to serve as President." In the fourth question, 71 percent said their "impression about the concerns" was "Serious — could be disqualifying for the position of President of the U.S." And in the fifth question, asked if they were aware of health issues Clinton had reported in the past and, in the final question, 73 percent said that any of those health issues would influence their vote for president. The poll was poorly designed. For example, in Question 4, 21 percent said the concern was "likely overblown." But to give that answer, a doctor had no choice but to agree with the statement that the concerns "should be addressed as with full release of medical records." The survey did not ask about each respondent's medical specialty, so the evaluations of neurologists, who might have better training on concussion issues, were lumped together with the responses of gynecologists. It did not ask the respondents if they had read the letter from Clinton's doctor asserting she had fully recovered from her 2012 concussion and blood clot in the brain or inquire where they had gotten their information on Clinton's health. And the survey did not ask comparable questions about Trump, whose doctor did not offer as much detail as Clinton's doctor and, instead, boasted that, if elected, Trump "will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency." Orient, who designed the survey, said it was not asking members to diagnose Clinton. "We were just asking whether they thought the concerns that had been raised were serious or not," she said. She said members weren't asked about Trump because he hasn't been accused of having serious physical problems. The AAPS news release makes no reference to only offering the survey to its members, so it’s not entirely surprising that the bloggers would omit this detail, too. When we asked Orient about that significant omission, she said via email, "This is what the press release said: 'Nearly 71 percent of 250 physicians responding to an informal internet survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS).' No other claims were made for it." Our ruling Prior to Clinton's current bout with pneumonia, bloggers reported that "71 percent of doctors say Hillary's health concerns are 'serious' and 'could be disqualifying.' " There was no national, scientific poll of doctors. The online poll surveyed physicians on the email list of a very conservative/libertarian medical group, which is significant information missing from the group's news release. The flaws are too serious for this survey to have credibility as an indication of how doctors feel about Hillary Clinton's health and how it affects her ability to be president. We rate this claim False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2016-09-12T14:15:30	2016-09-08	['None']
pomt-07152	"There was a recent report out that the premiums for Medicare and the payroll withholdings are only paying about half the program. So it is not financially solvent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/14/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-medicare-half-paid/	The issue of funding Medicare -- and specifically the viability of a voucher-like plan proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- was front and center at the Republican debate in New Hampshire on June 14, 2011. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty said he will offer a plan that differs from Ryan's. "It will feature performance pay rather than just volume pay to hospitals and clinics and providers," Pawlenty said. "It will allow Medicare to continue as an option, but it'll be priced against various other options that we're going to offer people, as well, and some other things." Although he has not released the particulars of his plan, Pawlenty said doing nothing was not an option. "There was a recent report out that the premiums for Medicare and the payroll withholdings are only paying about half the program," Pawlenty said during the debate. "So it is not financially solvent." Last month, we checked a similar statement from Pawlenty, who said on ABC's This Week that Medicare "only has about 50 percent of it paid for by either premiums or payroll taxes, and the rest is deficit spending ... or debt spending." Medicare, which provides health care to about 50 million elderly or disabled Americans, is financed through a combination of funding streams: a Medicare payroll tax; general revenue (mostly from federal income taxes); premiums paid by Medicare users; and a tax on Social Security benefits and state payments toward the prescription drug benefit. We'll go a little deeper in the weeds. The program is financed through two separate trust fund accounts: the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund. Medicare payroll taxes go to the HI trust fund, which is primarily used to pay for inpatient hospital stays (otherwise known as Medicare Part A). The SMI trust fund is used to pay for physicians visits, outpatient care and prescription drug benefits (Medicare Part B and Part D). The SMI trust fund is funded primarily (about 75 percent) through general revenue, with most of the rest coming from patient premiums. Let's start with the first half of Pawlenty's statement, that premiums and payroll withholding taxes only pay for about half the Medicare program. According to the 2011 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds, Medicare expenditures came to $523 billion in 2010. Here's a breakdown of the revenue side of the equation: • Payroll taxes, $182 billion • Premiums, $61 billion • Taxation of benefits, $13.8 billion • General revenue, $205 billion • Transfers from states for prescription drug benefits, $4 billion If you break out premiums and payroll taxes, Pawlenty is correct that they covered about half the cost of Medicare in 2010. It's the second half of the statement -- "So it is not financially solvent" -- that makes some Medicare experts uneasy. Lisa Potetz of the Washington consulting group Health Policy Alternatives Inc. and co-author of a 22-page "Primer on Medicare Financing" in July 2009, noted that from its start in 1965, the Medicare program was set up to be partially funded by general revenue. "His comment suggests that these things (payroll taxes and premiums) are supposed to pay for the program and aren’t doing their job," Potetz said when we spoke to her last month. "It was never the case that it was going to be entirely funded through payroll taxes and premiums. It's a little misleading to suggest something went awry." In fact, for years, the HI trust fund ran a surplus and was used to fund other parts of the federal budget. To the extent you consider that "banked" money, there was a balance of about $344 billion as of last year. In recent years, however, hospitalization and nursing home costs have outpaced the amount coming in from payroll taxes (a problem that is expected to get much worse in coming years as more baby boomers reach retirement age). As a result, the HI fund has been "drawing down" its surplus, and is expected to deplete it within several years. At that point, the gap between what's taken in from payroll taxes and the actual cost of hospitalization would have to be picked up by taxpayers. The SMI trust fund -- again, the fund used to pay for physicians visits and prescription drugs -- was set up so that a portion is paid through patient premiums, but the majority is paid from general revenue. Last year, the government paid $205 billion from general revenue into the fund. Cost projections for that program are cause for alarm, but the financing of the program was always intended to come primarily from general revenue, Potetz said. Medicare expert Marilyn Moon of the American Institutes for Research, an independent policy group, said a shift from hospital care to more outpatient care and physicians services has put a strain on the SMI fund, as has the prescription drug benefit added in 2006. In its 2011 annual report, the Medicare Board of Trustees warned: "The drawdown of Social Security and HI trust fund reserves and the general revenue transfers into SMI will result in mounting pressure on the federal budget. In fact, pressure is already evident. For the sixth consecutive year, a 'Medicare funding warning' is being triggered, signaling that projected non-dedicated sources of revenues -- primarily general revenues -- will soon account for more than 45 percent of Medicare’s outlays. That threshold was in fact breached for the first time in fiscal 2010." It's certainly true that the cost of Medicare is growing and that general revenue -- primarily from income taxes -- is shouldering a growing share of the load. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office concluded the exploding cost of Medicare and other entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Social Security had put the federal budget on an "unsustainable fiscal path." But inasmuch as Medicare has always been supplemented by general revenues, we think it's a little misleading to suggest the program is now insolvent. National defense and highway construction are paid by taxpayer dollars, too. Are they "insolvent"? We think that's too loaded a term. And so we rate Pawlenty's statement Mostly True.

pomt-06018	"More Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-tweets-more-americans-have-lost-their-/	With the perception swelling that he will be the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney has increasingly moved his attention away from his party rivals to President Barack Obama. On Jan. 16, 2012, Romney sent a tweet blasting Obama for his jobs record. "More Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history," Romney wrote. Several readers asked us to check it out. First, we should mention that there is no useful statistic for "Americans (who) have lost their jobs" during a given time period. The labor force is fluid, so people who lose their jobs often move quickly into another one. Instead, economists use the concept of net jobs gained or lost -- how many more (or fewer) people were employed on Date B than on Date A. When we asked the Romney campaign for backup material, they confirmed that they were talking about net jobs lost under a given president. So that’s the measure we used. We found that Obama is indeed the only president to have a net job loss if you count from inauguration day until the end of the presidency. But it’s not necessarily fair to credit or blame presidents for jobs created or lost during the first year on the job, since the president’s policies have not had time to take effect. Instead, if you start the count at one year into a president's term and end it one year -- a somewhat arbitrary method, but a defensible one -- it turns out that the Obama administration has presided over a net increase in jobs. So using this method, the premise of the Romney claim -- that the net jobs change for the nation as a whole under Obama was negative -- evaporates. In fact, using this method means that Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, becomes the only president to lose jobs on his watch. Let’s dig deeper into the numbers. The numbers starting at inauguration day As we noted, the numbers provided by the Romney campaign used jobs figures for the president’s first and last days in office. To replicate the campaign's math, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that tracks employment figures going back decades. Due to BLS data constraints and Romney’s use of the term "modern" presidents, we limited our search to presidents from Harry Truman on. In previous fact checks, we’ve tried to adjust for the time each president has spent in office. But since the Romney tweet was clear about referring to total numbers of people who lost jobs, rather than the rate at which people were losing jobs under each president, we did not take that additional step for this item. We first calculated how many jobs were gained or lost during each president’s tenure on a net basis. We also tried to adjust for the size of the population by dividing the net job gain or loss by the nation’s estimated population during the president’s first year in office. (Comparing jobs gained or lost under Obama, when the U.S. population is more than 300 million, to the changes under Truman, when the population was below 140 million, is comparing apples and oranges.) In this chart, the first number refers to the net jobs gained or lost during the president’s tenure starting at the very beginning of his term, and the second number refers to the net change in jobs as a percentage of the U.S. population. The presidents are listed in descending order by most jobs created: 1. Bill Clinton + 22,744,000 +8.8 percent of population 2. Ronald Reagan + 16,102,000 +7.0 percent of population 3. Lyndon B. Johnson + 12,183,000 +6.3 percent of population 4. Jimmy Carter + 10,339,000 +4.7 percent of population 5. Richard Nixon + 9,181,000 +4.5 percent of population 6. Harry Truman + 8,083,000 +5.8 percent of population 7. John F. Kennedy + 3,538,000 +1.9 percent of population 8. Dwight Eisenhower + 3,572,000 +2.2 percent of population 9. George H.W. Bush + 2,592,000 +1.1 percent of population 10. Gerald Ford + 2,073,000 +1.0 percent of population 11. George W. Bush + 1,094,000 +0.4 percent of population 12. Barack Obama - 1,663,000 -0.5 percent of population So by this measure, Romney is right: Obama is the only president who saw a net job loss during his presidency. This means it’s reasonable for him to say that "more Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history." But, as we noted, that’s not the only way to look at it. The numbers starting one year into each president’s term If you use the one-year-into-the-term yardstick, the numbers don’t change dramatically -- except for Obama and his predecessor. Here’s the same breakdown, again in descending order by net jobs gained or lost: 1. Ronald Reagan +18,594,000 +8.1 percent of population 2. Bill Clinton +18,117,000 +7.0 percent of population 3. Lyndon B. Johnson +11,959,000 +6.3 percent of population 4. Harry Truman +8,559,000 +6.1 percent of population 5. Gerald Ford +7,441,000 +3.5 percent of population 6. Richard Nixon +5,978,000 +2.9 percent of population 7. Jimmy Carter +5,962,000 +2.7 percent of population 8. Dwight Eisenhower +5,424,000 +3.4 percent of population 9. John F. Kennedy +4,326,000 +2.4 percent of population 10. George H.W. Bush +3,323,000 +1.3 percent of population 11. Barack Obama +2,619,000 +0.9 percent of population 12. George W. Bush - 1,310,000 - 0.5 percent of population So by this measurement, Obama doesn’t have a net loss of jobs at all -- in fact, the only president who does is George W. Bush. (Lest our readers think that using this methodology is some kind of liberal plot, we’ll also note that using this method gives almost 2.5 million extra jobs to Reagan, vaulting him over Clinton into the top spot in job creation among modern presidents.) It’s worth noting that Obama’s record on jobs through December 2011 is positive unless you start counting during the first three months of his administration -- January (as Romney did), February or March 2009. We might also note that Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009, and got Congress to pass his stimulus bill in mid February, a bill that took months to start pumping money into the economy. We won't argue that counting from one year into a president’s term (or four months, or nine months) is a better solution than counting from day one; that’s a matter of opinion. But we do think it underlines an important reality -- that making small changes to methodology can produce significant deviations in the results and weakens the black-and-white certainty of Romney’s claim that "more Americans have lost their jobs under Barack Obama than any president in modern history." It really depends on when you start counting. A final note: It’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the numbers in political attacks (or claims of political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit is justified. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we've talked to many workforce experts who tell us that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims less than True on our Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling Romney’s claim is accurate if you count from every president’s first day in office to his final day -- by those standards, Obama is indeed the only president since World War II to have presided over a net job loss. But if you compare each president from one year into his term to one year after the end of the administration -- a plausible approach if you hope to capture what kind of impact their policies had on the economy -- Obama’s job statistics shift into positive territory, while George W. Bush’s fall into negative territory. The fact that Obama’s -- or any other president's -- numbers can change dramatically depending on what timeline you use suggests that Romney’s conclusion isn't as telling as it sounds. Throw in PolitiFact’s perennial reminder that no politician is the sole cause of either jobs lost or jobs created, and we arrive at a ruling of Mostly False.

pomt-04825	"After one year, Tennessee’s students made their biggest single-year jump in achievement ever recorded in the state."	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/16/arne-duncan/secretary-education-says-tennessee-proof-education/	U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan argued in a recent online column that investments in education funding and incentives are starting to pay off. To make his case, he presented Tennessee’s new teacher evaluation system as Exhibit A. "After one year, Tennessee’s students made their biggest single-year jump in achievement ever recorded in the state," Duncan wrote in The Huffington Post on July 23, 2012. Duncan was citing a recent Tennessee Department of Education report that examined the first year of implementing the state’s controversial new teacher evaluation system. "As Tennessee has shown," Duncan concluded, "our children, our teachers and our country will be better off when school leaders and educators finally undertake the challenging task of creating a meaningful and useful system for supporting and evaluating our nation’s teachers." In 2011, Tennessee became one of the first states in the country to implement a comprehensive, student outcomes-based teacher evaluation system. The evaluations were part of broader school-reform legislation that passed the General Assembly with bipartisan support in 2010. The evaluation standards were enacted as part of Tennessee’s application for the $4 billion federal Race to the Top competition, which provides grants to states in recognition of education innovation and reform. Tennessee was one of the first two states to receive grants under the program. Fifty percent of the new teacher evaluations were required under state law to be based on student achievement data, including student growth on the Tennessee Value-Added Assessment System (TVAAS) or a comparable measure, as well as additional measures of student achievement. The other 50 percent of the teacher evaluations were to be determined through "qualitative measures," such a teacher observations, personal conferences and a review of prior evaluations and work. The evaluations were controversial from the beginning, especially with the Tennessee Education Association. Teachers argued the evaluations punished them rather than helping them improve. Some teachers complained they don’t teach subjects covered by the state tests, yet they are nonetheless judged on student test scores in those areas. We won’t attempt to analyze or fact-check all of the criticisms about the teacher evaluations, although we will note that an education advocacy group tapped by Gov. Bill Haslam to review the system recommended a number of improvements on June 11, 2012. A month later, the Tennessee Department of Education released its own one-year report on how the implementation has gone. That report also recommended a number of improvements and is the basis for Duncan’s column in The Huffington Post. For our purposes, we will stick to fact-checking Duncan’s claim that student achievement experienced its largest gains in the year after the evaluations were implemented. The state Department of Education report gives credence to Duncan’s statement. "The 2011-12 school year saw tremendous progress for public education in Tennessee, as measured by the most significant outcome – student achievement," the report said. "Test scores improved, in aggregate, at a faster rate than any previously measured year." Math and science test scores, in particular, increased significantly, the report noted. "To put this in perspective," the report said, "55,000 more students are at or above grade level in math than in 2010; 38,000 more students are at or above grade level in science." There is a caveat, however. In measuring student achievement, the state Education Department tracked the aggregate gains on statewide testing only as far back as 2007, said Kate Shellnutt, a spokeswoman for the department. That’s because the state now reports scores for grades 3-8 and high school subjects. Prior to 2007, the state reported scores for grades K-8 and high school. Comparing test scores now to anything prior to 2007 would not have been an apples-to-apples comparison. Also worth noting -- beginning in 2010, the tests for every subject and grade level became much more rigorous. Regardless, the growth and achievement over the past year "represents real change in the academic trajectory and potential life options for Tennessee students and can be the very real difference between long-term success and failure," the Education Department report said. The report attributed the strong academic performance to a number of factors, including higher academic standards; an accountability framework that recognizes ambitious but achievable goals; stronger professional development offerings funded in many cases through districts’ Race to the Top plans; and continued state financial investment in K-12 education despite a challenging budget climate. "We also believe teacher evaluation has played an important role in our student achievement gains as administrators have specifically cited its role in improving instruction," the report said. Our ruling While the new teacher evaluation system continues to be controversial, the state Department of Education report says it is at least partly responsible for the academic gains Tennessee students have made over the past year. During that period, student test scores approved, in aggregate, at a faster rate than any year since 2007, the most recent year in which comparable data is available. In his column, Secretary Duncan left out a couple of qualifiers about the student achievement – namely, that the teacher evaluations are partly but not solely responsible for the student improvement, and that comparable data on student achievement is available only back as far as 2007. Still, his larger point – that Tennessee students have made historic academic gains in the past year – is backed up by the state report. Thus, we rate his claim as Mostly True.

pomt-15141	Democratic Sens. Ed Markey, Al Franken and Jeanne Shaheen "took Bribes From Iran … They Back Insane NUKE Deal."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/01/blog-posting/internet-posts-say-three-democratic-senators-took-/	There’s no question that the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran has unleashed passions. Some of the passions directed against the deal are clear from a recent series of Web posts accusing Democratic lawmakers of accepting bribes from Iran to approve the deal. We first became aware of this allegation when a reader directed us to a post at the website Jewsnews.co.il, headlined, "ALERT: List Of Democrats Who Took Bribes From Iran… They Back Insane NUKE Deal." Other sites passed along the charge, including one with the headline, "The REAL Reason Why Dems Want Iran Nuke Deal – $$$$," on a site run by Samuel Wurzelbacher, who became famous as "Joe the Plumber," a critic of Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential race. The posts all track back to an article in FrontPageMag.com, a website published by the conservative David Horowitz Freedom Center. The original article is titled, "Traitor Senators Took Money from Iran Lobby, Back Iran Nukes." The article begins by accusing Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. -- a supporter of the nuclear agreement -- of topping "the list of candidates supported by the Iran Lobby. And the Iranian American Political Action Committee (IAPAC) had maxed out its contributions to his campaign. "After more fake suspense, (Minnesota Democratic Sen.) Al Franken, another IAPAC-backed politician who also benefited from Iran Lobby money, came out for the nuke sellout. "Senator Jeanne Shaheen (of New Hampshire), the Iran Lobby’s third Dem senator, didn’t bother playing coy like her colleagues. She came out for the deal a while back even though she only got half the IAPAC cash that Franken and Markey received." The article continues, "Democrats in favor of a deal that will let a terrorist regime go nuclear have taken money from lobbies for that regime. They have broken their oath by taking bribes from a regime whose leaders chant, ‘Death to America.’ " That’s a lot of tough rhetoric -- and there are more charges we didn’t mention about Iranian influence on Democrats aired in the rest of the article -- but we’ll focus here on the part about the three Democratic senators. The article references donations from the Iranian American Political Action Committee, which is the political arm of the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans. The group’s website confirms that IAPAC supported all three listed Democrats in the 2014 election cycle. To understand the charges, we’ll break down the claims into manageable pieces. First, did the three Democratic senators receive money "from Iran"? Second, is it true that the senators "took bribes"? And third, have these "bribes" only gone to Democrats? Did the senators receive money ‘from Iran’? It’s not logical to assume that just because a group has "Iranian" in its name that it’s a stooge for the government of Iran. In reality, the groups in question -- PAAIA and IAPAC -- are organizations that represent Iranian-Americans. That’s a key difference: Often, people emigrate to the United States because they oppose the government of their previous country. Just because a senator received money from a group of Cuban-Americans doesn’t mean they are effectively taking money from Fidel and Raul Castro. In fact, and certainly in the case of Cuba, it’s much more likely that the group’s members can’t stand the Castro regime. That’s not to say that an unfriendly government can’t subvert or co-opt a group of expatriates for its own purposes. Daniel Greenfield, the author of the original article, said in an email to PolitiFact that such a scenario has been "discussed and debated in the past by Iranian opposition groups," as has also been the case with organizations of "emigre Cubans, Chinese and Russians in the United States." However, the group itself strenuously denies that it is a front for Iran’s theocratic government. "We have no connection to the Iranian government -- no, none at all," said Morad Ghorban, director of government relations and policy for the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans. "We’re a non-profit, non-partisan, non-religious organization that is really here to serve the interests of the Iranian-American community before policymakers and the American public." Every year or so, the organization hires a pollster to survey Iranian-Americans, as a way of guiding the group’s policy agenda. The 2014 poll sheds some light on where the community’s sympathies lie regarding the current government of Iran. When asked which form of government would work best for Iran, 69 percent of Iranian-Americans said Iran should be a secular democracy, compared to just 9 percent who said it should be any form of an "Islamic Republic." The breakdown was much the same in the prior poll, from 2011. Such views undercut the notion that the organization is a puppet for the mullahs. The accusation that the group is a front for the Iranian regime "has no basis," said Vali Nasr, dean of the John Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and an expert in the region. "This organization is supported by Iranian-Americans in leadership positions across high-tech, finance, law and other sectors. It has no support from Iranian government. Its board and membership includes Republicans and Democrats and has a wide perspective on political issues." Did the senators take bribes? Given all the possible influences on a lawmaker’s vote -- the views of constituents, pressure from party leaders, lobbying by other interest groups, even their own gut feelings -- it’s hardly obvious that the support of Iranian-Americans was the factor that tipped the balance for them on the Iran deal. But even if you assume that it did represent the tipping point on their vote, it’s hard to consider this a "bribe." "If this is a bribe, then no one would be left on Capitol Hill," said Kenneth A. Gross, who heads the political law practice at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The Justice Department election-crime manual, he said, "is explicit that in order to prosecute a political contribution as a bribe, there needs to be an explicit quid pro quo. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Byron White, in McCormick vs. United States, essentially stated that political contributions are not bribes -- they are how we fund elections in the country." In bribery, it’s the agreement to vote a certain way that matters, added Brett Kappel, a partner in political law at the firm Akerman LLP. "Making a campaign contribution to a senator in the hope that he will vote for a resolution when it comes to the floor is not a bribe – there has to be an agreement" to do something, he said. And there’s even less reason in this case to believe these transactions would qualify as bribes. Markey, Franken and Shaheen all received their support from the group during the 2014 election cycle. At that point, there was not even a certainty that there would be a nuclear agreement, much less what it would contain. Have these ‘bribes’ only gone to Democrats? Actually, no: The group has given donations in a bipartisan fashion, including to a variety of Republicans who are almost certain to vote against the nuclear deal. During the 2014 campaign cycle, IAPAC gave money to such Republicans as Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Reps. Randy Forbes of Virginia, Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, John Mica of Florida, and Ed Royce of California, and the National Republican Congressional Committee. In the 2012 campaign cycle, the group supported GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and John Cornyn of Texas, Rep. Peter Roskam and the National Republican Congressional Committee, as well as a Democrat who has come out against the agreement, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. And in the 2010 campaign cycle, the group supported Sen. Charles Schumer, another Democratic opponent of the deal, as well as Republican Rep. Randy Wittman of Virginia. The original article did note that "the Iran Lobby had even tried, and failed to turn" Flake and Schumer into deal supporters. But it gave no indication of the breadth of Republicans who received support from the group, the lack of which communicates an unbalanced perspective on the group’s political leanings. The article’s author, Greenfield, said the focus on Democrats was justified. "The acid test of influence is action," he said. "The final determination will be seen when the vote happens. Currently, however, no Republicans are backing a deal ... while the Democrats listed in the article are. Other Democrats who have received Iran Lobby money have come out against the deal and were not in any way deemed traitors." We should note that the Iranian-American group’s 2015 poll found that 64 percent of Iranian-Americans approved of the framework agreement that preceded the final nuclear deal with Iran, compared to 20 percent who disapproved and 16 percent who were not sure. So Iranian-Americans, despite their concerns about the Iranian regime, do appear to support the deal by a wide margin. "Some of the candidates we supported in the past … are not going to be supporting this deal," said Ghorban of PAAIA. "There are other issues where we will work with them." Our ruling Posts on the Internet said that Markey, Franken and Shaheen "took bribes from Iran" on their way to supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran. The "bribes" in this case are campaign contributions, and there’s no evidence they are anything more than that. The donations came from a group of Iranian-Americans and not the government of Iran, and the allegation glosses over the fact that many top Republicans who oppose the nuclear deal also received the same type of support from the same group. This claim is wildly inaccurate. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2015-09-01T17:43:59	2015-09-25	['Al_Franken', 'Iran']

pomt-13951	"Of all the people in federal prison for possession of illegal substances, 77 percent of them are not citizens of the United States."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/jun/17/louie-gohmert/louie-gohmert-singles-out-large-share-federal-inma/	A Texas Republican, maintaining that proposed sentencing reforms won’t benefit Americans, told U.S. House colleagues that the vast majority of federal prisoners convicted of possessing illegal drugs aren’t even U.S. citizens. U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Tyler opened his May 10, 2016, floor remarks by mentioning concerns about opioid abuse and his suspicion that President Barack Obama wants to release thousands of criminals as part of sentencing reform under debate in Congress. Gohmert then questioned whether all that many Americans are behind bars for possessing illegal drugs such as marijuana. To the contrary, Gohmert said that "of all the people in federal prison for possession of illegal substances, 77 percent of them are not citizens of the United States. That is, 77 percent of those in federal prison for possession are not U.S. citizens," he said. "So, obviously," Gohmert asserted, "this president has been giving illegal, unconstitutional amnesties out like they were water at a marathon." Gohmert didn’t reply to our requests for the basis of his "amnesties" claim. Let's start by mentioning that state prisons hold many inmates with drug convictions. Regardless, we focused on whether nearly 8 in 10 inmates federally imprisoned for drug possession lack citizenship. In general as of April 2016, we found that nearly 80 percent of the federal system’s approximately 195,000 total inmates were U.S. citizens; 15 percent were citizens of Mexico, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Sentencing reform debate Gohmert made his comment in the wake of an April 2016 White House report stating that drug-related arrests spurted nationally between 1980 and 2014, contributing to rising incarceration rates. Specifically, a 2015 Pew Charitable Trusts analysis says, the share of federal inmates serving time for drug offenses increased from 25 percent in 1980 to a high of 61 percent in 1994 before decreasing due to rising admissions for other crimes—though drug offenders still represented 49 percent of federal inmates. "Changes in drug crime patterns and law enforcement practices played a role in this growth," the Pew report says, "but federal sentencing laws enacted during the 1980s and 1990s also have required more drug offenders to go to prison—and stay there much longer—than three decades ago." To our inquiry, Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project, which says it focuses on reforms in sentencing policy, addressing unjust racial disparities and advocating for alternatives to incarceration, stressed by email that the "vast majority of people in federal prison for a drug offense are there on a conviction for selling drugs, not possessing drugs." Gohmert’s backup To our request for factual backup, Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham said by email that Gohmert relied on a chart from the U.S. Sentencing Commission; its duties include the collection and distribution of information on federal crime and sentencing issues. The chart, "Citizenship of Offenders in Each Primary Offense Category, Fiscal Year 2015," has a line indicating that 1,680 of 2,181 individuals whose "primary offense" was "simple possession" of drugs (77 percent) were non-U.S. citizens. In general, according to the chart, 41,059 of 70,225 total convicts, 58.5 percent, were citizens with 29,166, nearly 42 percent, being noncitizens. But, we noticed, those counts solely reflected individuals sentenced to federal prison in the 12 months through September 2015--not the entire population of federal inmates. A BOP spokesman, Justin Long, answered our request for detail with an email stating that 84,911 inmates "are drug offenders (the offense associated with the longest term of sentence is a drug offense), and of those 18,132 (21%) are not U.S. citizens." Put another way, most drug offenders, including individuals convicted of drug trafficking, are Americans. But that’s also describing a more general population than what Gohmert singled out. Bureau officials told us the agency doesn’t classify inmates in the way that Gohmert did in his remarks. Fortuitously, Willingham sent us an April 2016 document she attributed to sentencing commission staff stating that as of March 27, 2016, 514 individuals were serving a federal sentence for simple drug possession--94 percent of them having been sentenced since September 2015. "Most of these offenders are non-citizens (95.5%)," the document says, "and most are Hispanic (96.9%)." The provided document didn't name an author or even specify the commission as its provider. Mindful that we can't rely on anonymous sources, we reached a commission spokeswoman, Christine Leonard, who confirmed the information we'd fielded from Willingham was earlier sent to a member of Congress. By phone, Leonard said that generally, Glenn Schmitt of the agency’s Office of Research and Data has a hand in producing such responses. Gohmert referred to 514 inmates So, who was Gohmert talking about that day? By our calculation, the tallied 514 prisoners amounted to about 0.6 percent of all drug offenders in federal facilities around the time he spoke--or 0.3 of 1 percent of all federal prisoners. The document has more detail including an indication that nearly all these possession-only inmates were sentenced in Arizona. For instance, a footnote says: "Simple Possession offenders are defined as offenders 1) sentenced under USSG §2D2.1," referring to a provision in the commission’s U.S. Sentencing Guidelines describing penalties for possession of heroin or any "Schedule I or II opiate, an analogue of these, or cocaine base." Other substances specified in the section include LSD and PCP. A "commentary" in the document says: "The typical case addressed by this guideline involves possession of a controlled substance by the defendant for the defendant’s own consumption. Where the circumstances establish intended consumption by a person other than the defendant, an upward departure may be warranted." The document also says: "The vast majority of the simple drug possession crimes for which offenders were incarcerated involved marijuana (97.5%)." "The median weight of the drug involved in the cases from the border districts was 21,700 grams (approx. 48 pounds)." Also, the document says, of offenders sentenced in a "border district, the average sentence was 6.3 months (and the median sentence was 6.0 months)." Next, we sought to learn more about the cases against the tallied inmates sentenced in Arizona. Perhaps something unique to that state explains its dominance of this statistical slice. By email when we sought guidance, Julie Samuels, a senior fellow in the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, speculated that the preponderance of noncitizens among the inmates reflects the likelihood that each one wasn’t eligible for probation or any sentence short of incarceration after which she or he would be deported. We didn’t confirm that. Cosme Lopez, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Phoenix, told us by phone he had no information about prosecutions of the inmates. Attempts to reach other possible experts in the state didn’t pan out. Our ruling Gohmert said that of "all the people in federal prison for possession of illegal substances, 77 percent of them are not citizens of the United States." In fact, nearly all the 514 inmates in federal prison for simple possession of illegal drugs aren’t citizens. But this claim lacks context. The clutch of inmates who fit Gohmert’s categorization--nearly all of them sentenced in Arizona since September 2015--account for a minuscule fraction of the people in the federal pen for drug crimes, of whom 21 percent are noncitizens. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-14052	Says Sen. John McCain "told dreamers that he’ll support the Dream Act, then he voted against it."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/may/24/ann-kirkpatrick/did-john-mccain-support-dream-act-then-vote-agains/	U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick says Sen. John McCain has changed after 33 years in Washington, D.C. On immigration, she said of her U.S. Senate rival, McCain’s changes are especially striking. "He told dreamers that he’ll support the Dream Act, then he voted against it," Kirkpatrick, D-Flagstaff, said in a May 8 interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (Dream) Act would have allowed undocumented children brought to the United States permanent resident status if they, among other provisions, completed two years of college or military service. We wondered if McCain really flipped his position on the Dream Act, as Kirkpatrick claimed. We found that McCain’s stance shifted slightly over more than a decade, but that does not equate to a cut-and-dried flip-flop. McCain’s voting record About a decade ago, McCain supported versions of the Dream Act. He even co-sponsored the 2003 and 2005 versions of the Dream Act, neither of which came to a vote. He did not sponsor the 2007 version of the bill. He also didn’t vote on it. McCain was campaigning for the Republican nomination for president. One of his opponents, Fred Thompson, had derided the legislation as "stealth amnesty." When the bill came up again in December 2010, McCain voted against it. The legislation eventually failed after a 55-41 vote in the Senate. What changed? Responding to conservative criticism, McCain stopped pushing for the Dream Act — unless it came with border security. Beefing up the border In November 2007, a month after his skipped vote on the 2007 Dream Act, McCain told the Myrtle Beach Sun-News that he would "vote against anything unless we secured the borders." A few months later in February 2008, McCain told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., that "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first." He did not mention the Dream Act in his remarks. After his "nay" vote on the legislation in 2010, the senior senator said in a statement that he had "great sympathy" for the affected students, but he couldn’t put their needs above law-abiding Americans. "There simply isn't sufficient political support to do anything before we secure our borders," McCain said, "and there won’t be until we do." What Kirkpatrick told Sharpton mimics an attack ad her campaign posted earlier in May. The ad claims McCain "has been on every side of immigration" and appears to show two clips of the Arizona senator speaking out both for and against the Dream Act. Kirkpatrick’s campaign spokesman provided a clip of McCain’s remarks at an immigration council in San Diego in July 2008 during McCain’s bid for the White House. In the clip, a young woman asks McCain if he would support "our Dream Act." McCain said "yes, yes." Left unmentioned in Kirkpatrick’s talking point is how he also said existing laws needed to be enforced. "Yes. Yes. Thank you. But I will also enforce the existing laws of a country. And a nation’s first requirement is the nation’s security, and that’s why we have to have our borders secured. But we can have a way and a process of people obtaining citizenship in this country. And we cannot penalize people who come here legally and people who wait legally. And so that’s a fundamental principle on which we have to operate." The campaign then contrasts that with McCain’s vote in 2010. McCain’s campaign spokeswoman pointed out that the senior senator co-sponsored the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration bill, which included a pathway to citizenship that included the Dream Act and also included provisions for border security. He voted yes. The Dream Act portion of the bill, which House Republicans refused to conference after it passed in the Senate, would have created a five-year path to documentation for immigrants, as long as they met requirements such as having a GED or high school diploma. Our ruling Kirkpatrick said, "McCain told dreamers that he’ll support the Dream Act, then he voted against it.’" Her statement leaves out important context. McCain’s views has shifted on the Dream Act, but his waning support hasn’t been the complete flip-flop Kirkpatrick makes it out to be. He did vote against the 2010 Dream Act, years after introducing similar measures in the Senate. But he supported the Dream Act in some form after the vote. He voted yes on the 2013 comprehensive immigration legislation that included pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought here as children from other countries. McCain made border security the priority before getting a Dream Act.

pomt-07276	The U.S. has "47 million people on food stamps. That’s 14 million more than when the current occupant of the White House took over."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/may/24/herman-cain/cain-said-food-stamp-program-use-under-obama/	With the fire of a Baptist preacher, Georgia’s newest presidential prospect warned a crowd of thousands that the country has gone astray under President Barack Obama. "We have become a nation of crises," Republican Herman Cain shouted during his Saturday announcement at Centennial Olympic Park that he’s running for president. "Look at the facts. Don’t listen to the rhetoric," he said. High gas prices. A rising national debt. High unemployment. "Forty-seven million people on food stamps," Cain said. "That’s 14 million more than when the current occupant of the White House took over." Food stamps? your PolitiFact Georgia scribes wondered. What’s with Georgia Republicans and food stamps lately? Last week, the state’s other presidential contender, Newt Gingrich, said Obama deserves to be called "the most successful food stamp president in American history" because "47 million Americans are on food stamps." We ruled Gingrich’s statement Half True. For the most part, Gingrich got his facts straight but oversimplified who was to blame. Cain, a former radio talk show host and Godfather’s Pizza CEO, urged the crowd at his rally to "look at the facts." PolitiFact Georgia is all to happy to oblige him. Food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, give certain low-income Americans vouchers to buy groceries. The most recent data show roughly 44.2 million people received SNAP benefits in February, the most recent data available. Cain’s numbers aren’t quite accurate, but he’s close. The number of recipients has topped 44 million since December, which means his estimate is about 7 percent too high. The number of beneficiaries has climbed every single month since Obama took office, despite signs of an improving economy. According to historical data, February’s count appears to be the highest in any month since the program was established in 1969. Obama took office in January 2009. That month, nearly 32 million people received SNAP benefits. That means the number of food stamp recipients has increased by about 12.2 million since the start of his administration. Cain placed the increase at 14 million, which is about 15 percent too high. Again, he’s close, but not quite right. Whether Obama deserves the blame for the increase is far less clear. The rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the Great Recession, which started more than a year before Obama took office. Conservatives and liberals agree that Obama inherited a troubled economy. Whether SNAP usage would have been lower if Republicans won the presidency is impossible to tell. The number of food stamp beneficiaries ticked upward under President George W. Bush because of policies that broadened eligibility for the program and more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place under Obama. Another reason assigning blame is tough is that there is typically a lag between when the broader economy begins to recover and when SNAP usage declines. The monthly growth has slowed for the past three months, and it could start declining in a month or two. Cain’s accusation against Obama was not as barbed as Gingrich’s, but he did lay the blame for food stamp usage at the president’s feet. We therefore give the presidential candidate a Mostly True.

pomt-01293	"Women and men both are making less when you adjust for inflation than when" John Kitzhaber was first elected governor.	false	/oregon/statements/2014/oct/30/dennis-richardson/are-oregonians-earning-less-now-when-john-kitzhabe/	Rep. Dennis Richardson, in his bid to unseat Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber in Tuesday’s election, has made repeated claims that the state is worse off now than when Kitzhaber was elected in 1994 to his first term. With Kitzhaber seeking what would be an unprecedented fourth term, Richardson, a Republican from Central Point, is urging voters to consider what he calls the Democratic incumbent’s many failures. The claim: During a televised debate before the City Club of Portland on Oct. 10, 2014, Richardson said Oregon’s economy has amounted to one long slump during Kitzhaber’s time in office, especially when it comes to wages. "Women and men both are making less when you adjust for inflation than when he started," Richardson said. Are working Oregonians really earning less today than they were in 1995? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We left telephone and email messages with Richardson’s campaign seeking a source for the claim but didn’t hear back prior to our deadline. We did receive an email from the campaign subsequently and have included its response below. Next we emailed Nick Beleiciks, an employment economist with the Oregon Employment Department. In a return email, he noted that there is "more than one source for this sort of information and multiple acceptable ways to adjust for inflation." Beleiciks pointed us to data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. He used those two sources to compile a list of the annual average monthly earnings of men and women working in Oregon between 1995 and 2013. Included in this category are full-time and part-time workers covered by Oregon’s unemployment insurance program, Beleiciks wrote. That includes just about everyone except federal employees, the self-employed, some agricultural workers, some students and other jobs not covered by unemployment insurance. Since Richardson’s claim hinged partly on adjusting wages for inflation, we asked Beleiciks about that, as well. He said three ways are used most often to accomplish this -- an all city average Consumer Price Index for all consumers (the most common); the Portland-Salem area CPI index for all consumers; and the Portland-Salem area CPI index for wage earners and clerical workers. All showed that both men and women working in 2013 -- the most recent year for which statistics are available -- made more money than their counterparts in 1995. Women, in fact, have seen larger earnings gains than men. A woman working in 1995, for instance, made an average of $2,328 a month using the most common way to adjust for inflation. The same woman in 2013 earned $2,853, a gain of $525 per month. A man, using the same adjustment made $3,883 a month in 1995 compared with $4,207 in 2013. That’s a monthly increase of $324. The other two methods yielded similar increases. Richardson’s campaign, in a subsequent email, provided U.S. Census Bureau data showing the Oregon median household income for 1995 as $36,374. The same table for 2013 shows it at $50,036. Using an automatic Inflation Calculator, the campaign contended that the latter figure would have to be six percent higher to remain even for inflation. We ran those numbers past Beleiciks. The $36,374 figure, he said, is based on the Current Population Survey using data for a single year. He noted that the Census publishes both a not-adjusted estimate (in current dollars) and an inflation-adjusted estimate (using 2013 dollars). The inflation adjusted figures he came up with were %55,375 for 1995 and $56,307 for 2013. "So the U.S. Census Bureau’s inflation-adjusted estimate of median household income in Oregon increased by $1,100 from 1995 to 2013." It didn’t, in other words, change the final result. The ruling: Richardson, in criticizing Kitzhaber’s years as governor, claimed that men and women working in Oregon nearly 20 years ago made more then than they do now adjusted for inflation. The Richardson campaign did get back to us but, regardless, the information it provided doesn't hold up. Data from the two federal agencies and the state Employment Department show that both genders make more today, when their wages are adjusted for inflation, than they did when Kitzhaber was first elected in 1995. We rate the claim False.	None	Dennis Richardson	None	None	None	2014-10-30T17:01:51	2014-10-10	['None']
pomt-04466	Says Bill Nelson "cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered here."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/oct/09/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-attacks-bill-nelson-health-car/	American Crossroads makes multiple claims about health care and Medicare in a recent ad attacking U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla. The ad shows a bleak photo of an empty examining table: "This is where seniors could find out their Medicare benefits have been rationed or don’t cover their treatments," states the narrator. Then the scene moves to a boardroom table: "And this is where 15 unelected bureaucrats could decide to cut Medicare spending, cuts that could go into effect without Congressional approval. And this is where Sen. Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered here," showing pictures of the U.S. Capitol and a hospital hallway. The claims by the conservative PAC are similar to other claims we’ve fact-checked, but the wording is slightly different. We will evaluate whether Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board make coverage decisions. (We contacted American Crossroads for their evidence, but we didn't hear back.) Deciding vote? Accusing Nelson of casting "the deciding vote" on the health care law has become a conservative talking point as he faces U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers. Ads from outside spending groups such as American Commitment, the 60 Plus Association and Mack himself have all made similar claims. As we explained in an earlier fact-check, the health care law was passed with several very close votes. One of the key votes happened on Dec. 24, 2009, when 59 Democrats and one independent voted together in favor of the bill. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters.) The ad cites a vote on Dec. 23 on a cloture motion which passed 60-39 with Nelson voting in the majority to move the bill forward. Opponents of the law have argued that any of those 60 cast the deciding vote, because every vote was needed to pass the bill. We find that argument unpersuasive (see our previous report), because there’s evidence in the record to show that some of those votes were more critical than others. On the health care law, some senators did hold out until the last minute -- but Nelson -- as in Bill Nelson of Florida -- wasn’t one of them. The Los Angeles Times, which wrote extensively about the negotiations in passing the law, reported that some of the most crucial votes came from Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.; Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb.; and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. Nelson was initially quiet about health care reform, angering some Democratic activists. But in October 2009, Nelson joined other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee in voting for the health care plan. Nelson wasn’t a leading early activist of the bill, but he wasn’t a last minute supporter, either. This part of the ad claiming that Nelson cast "the deciding vote" is wrong. Does the health care law cut Medicare spending by $700 billion? We’ve seen a long list of claims about the health care law and a $700 billion Medicare cut. How accurate the claims are depend on the wording. As we explained in our previous fact-checks, neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. In its most recent estimates, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law reduced Medicare outlays by $716 billion. The reductions include the amount of annual increases health care providers would receive from Medicare, administrative changes and alterations to Medicare Advantage. PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled that these don’t represent cuts, but rather an attempt to curtail future Medicare spending. The program is still projected to grow, the Congressional Budget Office predicts, just at a slower rate under the so-called Obamacare guidelines. An unelected board The ad also says that the health care law is "letting an unelected board decide what gets covered here" and says Medicare patients could find out their benefits have been "rationed." We’ve checked a whole slew of claims about the health care law and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. (The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation has a good primer about the board and a longer paper.) In many cases, political ads have falsely claimed that the board will ration care and deny treatments to patients. We have previously explained that the health care law directs the new board — with 15 members who are political appointees — to identify Medicare savings. It's forbidden from submitting "any recommendation to ration health care," as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue. Finally, the board only makes recommendations if Medicare is exceeding its budget targets. What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives, this could lead to reductions in services. But the board wouldn't make any health care decisions for individual Americans. Instead, it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost. The does mean the board decides what gets covered, at least in some cases. We should note, though, that Congress can override the board’s decisions if it makes up the cuts some other way. Our ruling American Crossroads packs a bunch of claims into one sentence in its ad: "Sen. Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare,cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered here." Let’s summarize on the three points: • Nelson cast a vote in favor of the health care law, but news reports suggest he was not even one of a few final hold outs. He did not cast "the" deciding vote. • The health care law cuts future growth of Medicare spending by about $700 billion but it still grows. This part of the ad has some truth to it but requires further explanation. • The unelected IPAB board is tasked with finding Medicare savings. It can reduce how much government pays for services, and some fear that could lead doctors to not order certain treatments. It does not make decisions for individual patients, but it can recommend changes to bring down costs, including about what gets covered. Its powers are limited, however, and its decisions can be changed by Congress if Congress is willing to identify other savings. The Crossroads ad phrases its statements more carefully than some others we’ve seen, but it still gives a misleading impression about what the health care law means for Medicare beneficiaries. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	American Crossroads	None	None	None	2012-10-09T17:05:31	2012-09-25	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']

pomt-14535	"When Jeb (Bush) was governor, his first four years as governor, his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/15/john-kasich/kasich-medicaid-spending-rose-twice-fast-under-jeb/	Every Republican presidential candidate opposes Obamacare, but Ohio Gov. John Kasich stands out for being the only one who took advantage of the program’s Medicaid expansion option. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush wasn’t going to let that choice go unnoticed. Bush touted his opposition to expansion in Florida during a debate in South Carolina. "The (Florida) governor was supportive of doing what John did," Bush said Feb. 13. "So was the Florida Senate. A committed speaker of the House asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion. I did, and it wasn't expanded there." To which Kasich shot back, "When Jeb was governor -- his first four years as governor -- his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine. Okay? It's just a fact." We can’t resolve which man is more fiscally responsible, but we can compare Medicaid spending trends. A decade and a half separates the periods -- 1999-2003 for Florida and 2011-15 for Ohio -- but with due regard for the vast change in circumstances, the numbers can speak for themselves. Kasich’s campaign provided Medicaid spending numbers for both Ohio and Florida and we confirmed them with independent sources in both states. The spending amounts, in millions of dollars, include both federal and state contributions to Medicaid. Ohio 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Change overall $17,681 $18,401 $18,857 $20,859 $23,467 32.7% Yearly change 4.1% 2.5% 10.6% 12.5% Florida 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 $6,947 $7,764 $8,901 $10,220 $11,437 64.6% Yearly change 11.8% 14.6% 14.8% 11.9% (In millions of dollars) Source: Florida State University; State of Ohio You can’t compare the amounts directly because inflation changes the value of the dollars across the decades. But in terms of growth, Medicaid spending did rise twice as quickly under Bush than it has more recently under Kasich. But we wouldn’t advise drawing simple conclusions from this. The factors behind the numbers Florida’s Medicaid budget did rise rapidly during Bush’s first term, largely due to more spending on long-term care. An Urban Institute report in 2002 said that as Bush took office, Florida had "a full-blown crisis" in nursing homes. "Chronic staffing shortages led to an erosion in quality of care, which in turn led to lawsuits that resulted in extremely large awards for complainants and skyrocketing liability insurance rates for the industry," the report said. Larry Polivka now heads the Claude Pepper Center, a public policy analysis group at Florida State University. In the early 2000s, he served on an advisory committee set up to suggest ways to fix problems in the long-term care system. Bush adopted many of the recommendations, such as more nursing home staffing, and they were not cheap. "Bush increased funding in the long-term care part of the budget very substantially," Polivka told us. A 2002 assessment by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department echoed Polivka’s point. "In January 2001, Gov. Jeb Bush partly unveiled his ‘elder-friendly’ initiative, which called for significant increases in funding for nursing homes and nursing home quality of care reform," according to the report, which noted Bush signed the changes into law in May 2001. Polivka said the state has a higher proportion of senior citizens than other states and anything done with nursing homes and other long-term care services will have a substantial impact on spending. Polivka said it didn’t help that the state also went through a brief recession in 2001. Unemployment rose over 2 percentage points in 2002. When the economy goes down, more people turn to Medicaid. Still, Polivka said the main driver in Florida centered on nursing home care, community-based care and at-home care. In Ohio, 15 years later, the economy helped the state. Unemployment dropped by nearly half, from 9.2 percent down to 4.7 percent. That eased demand on Medicaid. But the state did many things directly to rein in Medicaid spending. Amy Rohling McGee, president of the Health Policy Institute of Ohio, told us that Kasich focused on chronic illnesses, like asthma, and long-term care. McGee said administration policies played a significant role in trimming the rise in Medicaid costs, but she also noted that other trends were at play. "It’s hard to tease out what reduces health care spending growth," McGee said. "It’s likely a combination of factors. Experts around the country noted that healthcare spending was rising at a slower pace in recent years. Part of that was a post-recession slow down. Part of it might have been the Affordable Care Act. But changes in Ohio also made a difference here." Our ruling Kasich said that Florida’s Medicaid spending in the first four years of the Bush administration went up twice as quickly as they did during Kasich’s first four years in Ohio. The spending numbers bear that out. However, comparisons across very different states at very different times should be used with caution. Large national trends in health care inflation and the economy played a significant role in Medicaid spending in both states. Bush in Florida faced higher health care inflation and an economic slump. Ohio saw an easing of health care spending and an improving labor market. Still, budget and policy decisions by the two governors had an impact on Medicaid spending. The statement is accurate but it needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2016-02-15T18:04:26	2016-02-13	['Jeb_Bush', 'George_W._Bush']

pomt-05233	Says "TriMet now spends $1.63 in benefits for every $1.00 spent on wages."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/05/john-charles/does-trimet-really-pay-out-more-benefits-wages/	After a recent story in The Oregonian looked at TriMet’s high-cost union contracts -- and the way they’re draining the transit authority’s budget -- John Charles of the Cascade Policy Institute jumped into the discussion. He added this statement: "Due to the compounding effect of these contracts, TriMet now spends $1.63 in benefits for every $1.00 spent on wages." This isn’t the first time that Cascade has taken a critical look at the way TriMet spends money, but after Charles’ post was sent out as a tweet, we couldn’t help but wonder if he was right. We went to Charles directly and he pointed us to TriMet’s 2011 annual financial report. On Page 7, there’s a chart that lays out the figures clearly. In 2011, labor expenses accounted for $123,482,000 of spending. Fringe benefits, meanwhile, accounted for $200,875,000. Those numbers do indeed show that TriMet spends about $1.63 in benefits for every $1 on wages. We followed up with TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch. She verified the numbers that Charles had pointed out. But she also pointed out that "fringe benefits" includes a number of different categories: medical coverage, disability payments, workers comp and unemployment, time off and some others. It’s unlikely the average person would consider payouts to workers comp and unemployment coverage to be benefits in the traditional sense. They’re not the sort of thing you negotiate before taking a job -- they’re the cost of being an employer. It’s also worth pointing out that the money being spent on fringe benefits doesn’t just go to current employees. As our own Joseph Rose pointed out in his initial story, the authority’s benefit plans follow workers and their families into retirement -- and medical coverage for spouses and dependents continues even after a former employee’s death. Mary King, a professor of economics at Portland State University, said lumping those sorts of costs in with this discussion may be misleading. "I think it's really a huge red herring to start talking about what TriMet might be paying for past employees," she said. "That's an attempt to make it look like they're paying a lot." Now, Charles didn’t specifically decide to throw those sorts of things into the benefits category -- that’s just the way TriMet lays out the budget. Still, the best way to get at whether benefits seem high in comparison to wages would be to look at the average salary of a represented employee and their average benefit payout. Fetsch was able to give us the figures budgeted for fiscal year 2013. According to her data, TriMet will pay out an average of $67,000 in wages for each union employee and about $33,500 in benefits. If you consider these numbers rather than the aggregate figures Charles used, TriMet pays about 50 cents in benefits for every dollar it spends on wages. But that leaves out the current portion of the union pension, which most people would consider a significant benefit. Going back to the 2011 numbers, another caveat here is that, in a strict sense, TriMet didn’t pay out the full $200 million. About $70 million of that went unpaid -- but it still remains a future obligation. Eventually TriMet will have to pay it. In the meantime, it’ll keep incurring similar costs year after year. Charles said "TriMet now spends $1.63 in benefits for every $1.00 spent on wages" and the budget bears this out. While the statement is accurate, some of that $1.63 is going to past employees as well as other basics -- like unemployment -- that most would not consider part of their benefit package. That’s the clarification that affects our ruling. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	John Charles	None	None	None	2012-06-05T16:16:05	2012-05-16	['None']

pomt-03972	Says Texas ranks first among the states in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and toxic chemicals released into water.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/13/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/california-editorial-says-texas-tops-carbon-dioxid/	Reacting to Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch and woo of Californians, a Sacramento Bee editorial played off of a radio ad in which Perry urged businesses there to check out Texas. The Feb. 6, 2013, editorial listed various ways Texas isn’t so great. We’ve since piled up related fact checks, here. For this article, we’re reviewing this Texas reference in the editorial: "Come check out a state that ranks... first in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and first in the amount of toxic chemicals released into water." No. 1 polluter, times two? Stuart Leavenworth, who oversees the Bee editorial page, did not offer backup for the reference to toxic chemical releases. But he pointed us to a Texas news account about carbon dioxide emissions. For our look, we’ll consider CO2, then toxic chemicals put into water, looking both at raw amounts and the totals adjusted for state populations and economic output. Carbon dioxide emissions The Jan. 12, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article says that according to federal data released that day, Texas releases far more greenhouse gases into the air than any other state. The story continues: "Texas' coal-fired power plants and oil refineries generated 294 million tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in 2010, more than the next two states – Pennsylvania and Florida – combined, the data show." The story says the Environmental Protection Agency released the data from the largest industrial sources across the country for the first time as part of a broader effort to reduce emissions linked to global warming. It says the agency "collected data from more than 6,700 industrial facilities that release at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the air a year. The threshold is comparable to the emissions from burning 131 railcars of coal, the EPA said." To our inquiries, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Sierra Club in Texas each guided us to even more recent EPA data on industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change, the federal agency says. And on the agency’s website, it’s possible to check on each state’s industrial emissions of eight gases, among them carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons. According to the posted information, Texas industrial facilities in 2011 emitted 391 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels. The database indicates that industrial CO2 emissions in other populous states were lower: California (95 million metric tons); New York (44); Florida (123); Illinois (41); Pennsylvania (141): Ohio (142); Michigan (89); Georgia (82); North Carolina (66); and New Jersey (23). Louisiana, on the Gulf Coast like Texas, had 132 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, according to the agency. It’s no surprise, perhaps, that Texas plants make the state No. 1 in industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Neil Carman, who directs the Clean Air program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, told us by email: "Realize that Texas has more large oil refineries, major chemical and petrochemical plants, hundreds of natural gas processing plants, Portland cement kilns, carbon black plants, etc. than any other state because of the strength of the oil & gas industry and the large geographical size and population base as well." Carman’s comment underscored a hitch in the federal information. The data does not reflect total gases emitted in each state--just those attributed to industrial facilities. Yet Al Armendariz of the Sierra Club guided us to a spreadsheet prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on its analysis of emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels, estimating that in 2010, Texas had 653 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. California placed second, at 370 million metric tons, and Pennsylvania was third, at 257 million metric tons. So, Texas has been No. 1 in total CO2 emissions. However, we calculated, Texas would have tied for 13th among the states if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population that year, as gauged by the U.S. Census Bureau. Less populous states led after this adjustment, topped by Wyoming (108 metric tons per capita); North Dakota (76); Alaska (56); Louisiana (50); Montana (36); Kentucky (35); Indiana (34); Iowa (30); Alabama and New Mexico (28); Nebraska and Oklahoma (27). Kansas and Texas each had 26 metric tons of CO2 emissions per resident. California emissions were 10 metric tons per resident. Toxic chemical releases Wondering how Texas ranks in toxic chemicals released into water, we queried Luke Metzger, who heads Environment Texas, which describes itself as a statewide citizen-funded advocate for clean air, clean water and open spaces. Metzger pointed out that the EPA maintains a Toxic Release Inventory, tabulating reported releases into waterways of 231 toxic chemicals or classes of toxic pollutants. Environment Texas drew on the inventory for an April 2012 report stating that Texas ranked fourth nationally in 2010 with 14.3 million pounds of toxic discharges. Top Ten States by Toxic Industrial Releases Into Waterways, 2010 (Millions of Pounds) Indiana 27.4 1 Virginia 18.1 2 Nebraska 14.7 3 Texas 14.3 4 Georgia 12.6 5 Louisiana 10.9 6 Pennsylvania 10.1 7 Alabama 9.9 8 Ohio 9.1 9 North Carolina 9.2 10 Source: Environment Texas, April 2012 report. According to the report, Indiana had the most toxic releases, more than 27 million pounds, followed by Virginia (18 million pounds) and Nebraska (14.7 million pounds). Nationally, 226 million pounds were released in 2010, the report says. It cautions, too, that the totals solely reflect industrial releases, not accounting for other sources including wastewater treatment plants and agriculture-related facilities. Still, the report says, the federal inventory is the "best and most complete set of data available." Adjusting these figures for each state’s 2010 population changes the rank order, putting Texas at No. 10, with toxic releases of 0.6 pounds per resident--and that is also without checking per-capita tallies for 40 remaining states. On a per-person basis, Nebraska led the nine other states, at 8 pounds per resident, followed by Indiana (4) and Virginia (2). Every other of the 10 states had a ratio of less than two pounds per resident. By telephone, a consultant to Environment Texas, Tony Dutzik of the Boston-based Frontier Group, said another way to gauge CO2 emissions and toxic releases into water by state is to compare totals compared to each state’s Gross Domestic Product, which indicates its economic activity. We tried that for the 2010 toxic releases by using state GDPs for 2010, as posted by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. By this filter, Nebraska had the most toxic releases per dollar of GDP, Texas the 10th-highest--again, only among the 10 states identified as having the most overall industrial releases that year. We also applied the GDP filter to the 10 states, including Texas, that had the greatest industrial CO2 emissions in 2010. By this metric, Texas was tied with Kansas for 12th; Wyoming ranked first. By email, Metzger sent a spreadsheet, which he said Dutzik had built from more recent data posted by the EPA, indicating that Texas ranked third overall among the states in industrial toxic releases into water in 2011, trailing Indiana and Virginia, but running ahead of Georgia. Our ruling The editorial said Texas ranks first nationally in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and toxic chemicals released into water. We can see a basis for the first part of the claim, though not the second. Texas ranks No. 1 in CO2 emissions, by a wide margin. But it trailed about a dozen states in 2010 after each state's emissions were adjusted for the state's population or economic output. In 2011, Texas ranked third in total industrial releases of toxic chemicals into water; it was fourth nationally the previous year--and adjusting for each state’s population or economic output leaves Texas in 10th place among those states with the most industrial toxic releases that year. We rate this two-part claim as Half True.	None	Sacramento Bee Editorial Board	None	None	None	2013-02-13T17:01:24	2013-02-06	['None']
pomt-07873	"Some politicians … want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/07/americans-against-food-taxes/americans-against-food-taxes-ad-during-super-bowl-/	Along with Doritos and Bud Lite commercials on Super Bowl Sunday, viewers in the Washington area saw a political ad against taxes on food and soft drinks. We wondered if the ad was correct that politicians are seeking to tax sodas and food, so we decided to put the claim to the Truth-O-Meter. The ad features a woman talking to the camera as she shops in a grocery store. It has been airing for several weeks in selected markets on cable channels such as CNN. "Feeding a family is difficult enough in today's economy," the woman says. "Now, some politicians want the government telling me how I should do it. They want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries I buy, like soft drinks, juice drinks, sports drinks, even flavored waters, trying to control what we eat and drink with taxes. Give me a break. I can decide what to buy without government help. The government is just getting too involved in our personal lives." At that point, a narrator says, "Government needs to trim its budget fat and leave our grocery budgets alone." First, some background on the group airing the ad, Americans Against Food Taxes. The group is spearheaded by the American Beverage Association, which represents the makers of sodas and other drinks. According to Advertising Age, the American Beverage Association decided to form the coalition in June 2009, when the idea of taxing sodas and other sweet beverages was being considered as a way to fund the Democratic health care bill. The coalition includes dozens of members, including 7-Eleven, Inc., Burger King Corp., Domino’s Pizza, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, McDonalds, the National Association of Convenience Stores, Snack Food Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. Although the food and beverage tax was not included in the health care law, the group has continued to run advertising to forestall any effort to revive such taxes. People watching the ad might think Congress is still considering such a proposal at the federal level. But if you listen closely, the ad played during the Super Bowl is careful to refer to "politicians" and "government" rather than "Washington" or "Congress." (By contrast, other ads the group has run have mentioned Washington.) The ad is correct that politicians in some cash-strapped states are considering food and drink taxes. In the last two years, many states and cities considered such taxes. According to the Campaign for Healthy Kids, an advocacy group that generally favors such efforts, taxes on soda were enacted in Washington state and proposed -- but not passed -- in Mississippi, New Mexico and the city of Philadelphia. In New York, Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, a New York City Democrat, has proposed a tax on foods high in calories, fat or carbohydrates, for the past several legislative sessions. Most state lawmakers were sworn in only a few weeks ago, so we can't predict how many states will consider soda-tax proposals this year. But already, legislators have introduced bills to impose or raise the tax on sodas and/or snack foods in Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia, according to separate legislative tracking by the Center for Consumer Freedom, a pro-business advocacy group, and Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. So while Congress has not been active on this proposal since it was dropped from the health care law, it's been proposed in many states. The ad is correct that "some politicians … want to put new taxes on a lot of groceries." We find the statement True.

pomt-06830	"You might be surprised to know that 137 billion gallons flows (into Lake Erie) every day. You might be surprised to know that only 86.3 billion gallons flow out. ... Leaving us a net surplus of approximately 50 billion gallons a day."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/08/tim-grendell/state-sen-tim-grendell-claims-more-water-flows-lak/	Who knew water could be so political? It's happened this year in Ohio as a debate over how to best use -- or not use -- the fresh water supplies of Lake Erie and the Great Lakes as a whole has raged in the hallways of the Ohio Statehouse. The debate has focused on House Bill 231, a piece of legislation that was supposed to implement the eight-state Great Lakes Compact that Ohio agreed to be a part of in 2008. The legislation was approved by the General Assembly, but then vetoed July 15, 2011, by Gov. John Kasich. Environmental groups as well as former Govs. Bob Taft and George Voinovich have fought the legislation, saying it allows businesses to use too much water without permits and could cause Lake Erie water levels to drop, leaving it prone to algae problems. Leading the charge for the legislation has been Sen. Tim Grendell, a Chesterland Republican, who has used a steady stream of statistics about water flowing in and out of Lake Erie to suggest that criticisms are overblown. On June 28, before the Ohio Senate voted, Grendell gave a floor speech in support of the bill that suggested Lake Erie takes in more water than the amount that flows out. In fact, Lake Erie actually had a surplus of water, therefore diminishing the arguments of those concerned about water withdrawals made by businesses, Grendell claimed. "You might be surprised to know that 137 billion gallons flows in every day," Grendell said. "You might be surprised to know that only 86.3 billion gallons flow out. . . . Leaving us a net surplus of approximately 50 billion gallons a day." We were surprised to hear more water was flowing into Lake Erie than flowing out. So we decided to check and see if Grendell's figures were high and dry. Grendell told us that he got his information about the water flowing into the lake from the Ohio Environmental Council, which in turn got it from a May 2009 summary of a draft report of the International Upper Great Lakes Study prepared by the International Joint Commission. He said he got his information about the water flowing out from U.S. Geological Survey official Dick Bartz as well as from an unnamed expert with the New York state parks who calculated the amount that flows over Niagara Falls. The expert was contacted by an aide to Rep. Jim Buchy, according to an e-mail Grendell gave to Politifact Ohio. The aide, Justin Barnhart, said the expert was actually Angela Berti, marketing and public affairs coordinator for New York’s state office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, which operates the U.S. side of Niagara Falls. We dug out the summary of the draft report from the International Upper Great Lakes Study. We quickly found the key document section. But the numbers in the report are measured in cubic meters per second and in thousands of cubic feet per second. In order to convert those numbers into gallons per day, we needed some math help, as we were clearly out of our depth. (Hard to fathom, we know.). So we turned to Bartz, the U.S. Geological Survey official who was a former Chief of the Division of Water of ODNR under Gov. Taft. Bartz calculated the numbers in the report to show that about 137 billion gallons of water flows into Lake Erie from the Detroit River and from runoff to the lake and smaller tributaries. That's exactly the number Grendell used on the Senate floor. So Grendell was right on how much flows in? Not so fast. There is also about 16.8 billion gallons worth of rainfall that make it into the lake, according to Bartz's calculation of the report's numbers. So the average daily total amount of water flowing into Lake Erie is about 154 billion gallons. To figure how much flowed out of the lake each day, Grendell took a pair of calculations that Bartz did for evaporation (16.8 billion gallons a day) and the amount used by Ohioans each day (3.54 billion gallons a day) and added to them the 66 billion gallons a day that New York’s Berti said flowed over Niagara Falls. Berti confirmed to us that she gave Buchy’s office "commonly accepted" numbers of gallons of water a second that go over the falls collectively known as Niagara Falls. Her gallons per second estimates, taken from the state’s website, work out to 65.5 billion gallons a day. That math gave Grendell about 86 billion gallons, roughly 50 billion gallons a day less then what he said was flowing into Lake Erie. However, Bartz said that equation is off. He agreed that Grendell has accurately quoted him as saying there is 16.8 billion gallons of water evaporation. However, he said the 66 billion gallons that Berti calculated flowed over Niagara Falls doesn’t equal all the water that flows from Lake Erie into Lake Ontario. Bartz said that along with the 66 billion gallons a day that Berti calculated are huge amounts of water diverted to power plants above the falls and then discharged back into Lake Ontario below the falls. In all, Bartz said about 131.8 billion gallons of water flow into Lake Ontario from Lake Erie both over the falls and from the diversions to power plants. Additionally, Bartz calculated that about 5.8 billion gallons of water are diverted by a pair of canals, the Welland Canal in Ontario and the New York State Barge Canal. Bartz said most of the water that Ohioans use every day eventually makes its way back into the Lake Erie basin so it’s not a key number to use in the equation. Add it all up -- the water over Niagara Falls, the water diverted around Niagara Falls, the water funneled into two canals canal and the water that evaporates -- and on the average about the same amount of water flows out of Lake Erie as flows into it, Bartz said -- roughly 154 billion gallons a day. "It's basically about the same," Bartz said. If Grendell's theory were true that more water was flowing into Lake Erie than flowing out that there would be a noticeable effect., Bartz said. "If there were more coming in than going out we would have seen lake levels rise." Actually, Bartz said Lake Erie water levels were at their highest in the 1970s and have dropped slightly since that time. So awash in these watery figures, what do we have? Trying to make his case that Ohio has more water than it could ever use, Grendell asserted that about 137 billion gallons of water a day flowed into Lake Erie and only 86 billion gallons a day flowed out. However, the acknowledged expert in this area said that Grendell’s math is all wet. The expert calculates the amount of water flowing into lake Erie as roughly the same amount flowing out each day (about 154 billion gallons a day.) If that wasn't the case, we would see a spike in overall Lake Erie water levels rise, which hasn’t happened. On the Truth-O-Meter, Grendell's claim rates as False.

pomt-08400	Says Ron Johnson "likes to say there are too many lawyers in the Senate – 57. He’d be the 70th millionaire."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/22/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-ron-johnson-would-become-70th-m/	Republican Ron Johnson has made clear he thinks the U.S. Senate has a surplus of lawyers, whose ranks include Democrat Russ Feingold, the guy he’s trying to replace. Feingold’s retort: the more worrisome surplus is millionaires -- and Johnson would add to their ranks. On the campaign trail, Feingold has long told voters that Johnson, an Oshkosh manufacturing executive, is trying to buy the seat. More recently, Feingold has hit the theme harder. "His idea for growing our economy is to give millionaires like himself more tax cuts," Feingold told supporters at an Oct. 18, 2010 rally the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. "He likes to say there are too many lawyers in the Senate – 57. He’d be the 70th millionaire. I think they’re a little over-represented." Is Feingold right on the fat-cat factor? It’s not an easy question to answer, because senators are not required to disclose their true net worth. Under the required financial disclosure reports, they are allowed to list broad dollar-value ranges for assets and debts. As support for the claim, Feingold’s campaign cites a widely quoted 2009 study by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. The group’s work takes the 2008 asset and liability figures that senators reported and finds a mid-point to approximate net worth. The center’s study found that 67 of 100 senators carry a net worth of greater than $1 million. Wisconsin’s Herb Kohl, a Democrat, was the richest on the list at $214 million. PolitiFact Wisconsin updated the study to include three new senators -- Scott Brown of Massachusetts, George LeMieux of Florida and Carte Goodwin of West Virginia -- who were appointed or elected after the group’s study came out. Two of the newbies, LeMieux and Brown, have a net worth above the $1 million mark, based on our calculations using the center’s methodology. That’s the math the Feingold campaign used to get to Johnson as the 70th: 67 + 2 + Johnson = 70. Of course that slots Johnson into the current crop of senators. If Johnson wins Nov. 2, he will likely be part of a different mix -- some incumbents are retiring or lost in primaries, others may lose on election day. How accurate are the numbers compared to senators’ true net worth? If you take Feingold as an example, the wealth estimates appear to be conservative. Feingold takes the extra step of voluntarily disclosing his exact net worth through tax returns and a complete statement of net worth. The Journal Sentinel asks Wisconsin members of Congress for that information. In 2008 Feingold reported a net worth of $452,500 -- far above the $83,000 figure that ranked him one of "10 poorest" senators in the Center for Responsive Politics study. As for Johnson, based on the center’s methodology and his 2010 disclosure form, Johnson’s net worth would be $17.8 million. That would put him in the top 15 wealthiest members of the current Senate, though for the others the 2008 figures are being used. So let’s review our math. In turning the tables on Johnson, Feingold says the problem isn’t lawyers in the Senate, but millionaires. He pegs Johnson as the would-be 70th, though that would be in the current Senate -- not whatever mix is there after the election. By our calculations, and those of the Center for Responsive Politics, Feingold is accurate. If anything, the methodology underestimates a person’s net worth -- and therefore may under-count the actual millionaires in the body. We rate his statement True.

pomt-11928	Says he got "support all over Raleigh"	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/oct/13/charles-francis/candidate-raleigh-mayor-says-he-got-support-all-ov/	Charles Francis stood outside his law firm in downtown Raleigh on Wednesday and gave several reasons he might have a shot at beating Mayor Nancy McFarlane in a runoff. A majority of voters supported someone besides McFarlane, Francis noted. That’s true; if you add up the 19,232 votes for Francis, a Democrat, with those of Republican candidate Paul Fitts, it equals more than McFarlane’s 25,414. (The race is nonpartisan but candidates and political parties often align themselves with each other.) Francis said he got "broad support in some inside-the-Beltline precincts and some northwestern precincts." He said he ran "neck and neck" with McFarlane in Brier Creek and that he "had support all over Raleigh." Since McFarlane didn’t get 50 percent of the vote (she got 48 percent), Francis can call for a runoff and has until Oct. 19 to make the decision. It’s no surprise that Francis, the Democratic candidate in a city dominated by registered Democrats, got votes in every precinct. But his claim that he got "support all over Raleigh" implies that he was competitive across the city. Let’s look at his level of support and where he got it. A map showing precincts across Raleigh appears to show a city that’s almost evenly divided between McFarlane supporters in the west and Francis supporters in the east. Francis, who is black, campaigned on the idea that McFarlane and the City Council haven’t done enough to help Southeast Raleigh, which is predominantly black. Preliminary election results suggest racial, economic and geographic differences between McFarlane voters and Francis voters. Northwest Raleigh Francis said he had "broad support from some northwestern precincts." The lone precinct he won west of Falls of Neuse Road had 11 total votes. Francis got seven of them. Otherwise, McFarlane carried every northwestern Raleigh precinct. In the area east of Glenwood Avenue, north of Interstate 440 and west of Atlantic Avenue and Litchford Road, McFarlane won 22 precincts by more than 100 votes. There were five northwestern precincts where McFarlane and Francis were separated by fewer than 50 votes. Francis said his "neck and neck" comment referred to the precinct encompassing the Brier Creek area, where McFarlane got 235 votes and he got 210. Votes in the other four precincts broke down this way: 31-13, 99-65, 127-78 and 57-30. Overall in those five close precincts, McFarlane garnered a total of 549 votes and Francis got 396. Southeast Raleigh There’s no concrete definition of the area that defines "southeast Raleigh" but it’s generally considered to be the area south of New Bern Avenue and east of Wilmington Street. By that definition, Francis won most precincts handily. He won all but five precincts by more than 100 votes. In some of those, he won more than 85 percent of the vote. Two precincts straddle Wilmington Street and McFarlane won both of those. But, unlike other southeast Raleigh precincts, the majority of voters in those precincts are white. Francis won one precinct by only 23 votes, but it was in a district where only 63 votes were cast. Inside the Beltline This is where Francis suffered his biggest losses. Interstate 440 and, in some places, Interstate 40 combine to make a loop around downtown Raleigh known as the Beltline. The Beltline encompasses the state Capitol, county seat – meaning it’s home to many government offices – and several universities, as well as the city’s richest and poorest residents. A PolitiFact analysis found that McFarlane carried 26 of the 33 precincts that are inside the Beltline or that straddle it, drawing 8,521 total votes to Francis’ 5,066. Francis defeated McFarlane by more than 100 votes in four precincts and by 98 votes in another – but they were all in southeast Raleigh. He drew 366 votes and beat McFarlane in precinct 01-28, which is more east than southeast, but only by seven votes. In another precinct that overlays part of Gorman Street and Western Boulevard southwest of downtown, Francis only lost 158 to 142. But elsewhere inside the Beltline, McFarlane trounced him. There were 19 ITB precincts where McFarlane had more than twice as many votes as Francis and 10 precincts where she had three times as many votes as him. She easily won most precincts west of Atlantic Avenue, south of Interstate 540 and north of Glenwood Avenue. More data coming The election results on the N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement website are preliminary. The vote counts haven’t been finalized. More than 9,000 residents voted early: giving McFarlane 4,297 votes and 4,018 for Francis. And, as the Francis campaign pointed out, the board has yet to sort those votes into the precincts where the voters reside. There are 108 precincts, but only six early voting sites. Another 400 residents voted by mail. So it’s possible that candidate performances in specific precincts results fluctuate in a week or so. Until then, the public has only the preliminary results to inform them about candidate performances. Our ruling Francis said he got support "all over Raleigh." He also said he got "broad support in some inside-the-Beltline precincts and some northwestern precincts" and that he got "overwhelming support in Southeast Raleigh." Francis was right about his performance in Southeast Raleigh but wasn't exactly competitive in northwest Raleigh and inside the beltline. That large swath of Raleigh stretching from Hillsborough Street to Millbrook Road – where he didn’t come close to competing with McFarlane – is too big and too dense of an area to suggest that he was competitive "all over Raleigh." We rate his claim Half True.	None	Charles Francis	None	None	None	2017-10-13T20:01:59	2017-10-11	['None']
pomt-09474	Florida "has the second-highest foreclosure rate in the nation."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/02/kendrick-meek/florida-home-foreclosure-rate-among-worst-us/	It's become a common refrain for Florida candidates: The state has one of the nation's highest foreclosure rates. Kendrick Meek, a member of Congress from South Florida and a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, mentions the foreclosure problem on his campaign Web site. "The housing crisis is one of the most critical issues facing Florida. Kendrick Meek believes more needs to be done to help Floridians in danger of losing their homes. Currently, one in five Florida families are one or more months behind in their mortgage payments, and the state has the second-highest foreclosure rate in the nation. Home values have dropped, leaving those who are able to keep their homes often owing more than their home is worth," writes Meek. We know the problem is more severe in Florida, but we wanted to know if Meek was right that the state has the second-highest foreclosure rate in the country. The campaign said it relied primarily on a January 2009 report issued by RealtyTrac, a company that keeps data on foreclosed properties. That report highlights Florida as having both the second-highest number of foreclosed homes and the second-highest foreclosure rate (a subtle but important difference). The campaign also pointed us to South Florida Sun Sentinel article from December 2009 and a January 2010 Bay News 9 report that both say the same thing. We started by checking the RealtyTrac report, which was released Jan. 15, 2009, and covers foreclosure statistics for 2008. Indeed, it put Florida in second place in both total foreclosed homes and the foreclosure rate. But that report is now more than a year old. RealtyTrac's monthly reports since then have varied slightly, but Florida is always near the top. It was fourth for January 2009, third in April and second in November. For all of 2009, Florida ranked third. So Meek is either right or close to being right, depending what time period you use. We find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-07662	Says Texas school districts are the fifth largest employers in the world.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/mar/11/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-texas-school-districts-all-told-a/	Framing his case for slimming school district staffs, GOP state Sen. Dan Patrick aired what the Texas Tribune called a "staggering" statistic--that the state’s school districts are the fifth largest employers in the world. We paused too at Patrick’s statement, as paraphrased in a Feb. 25 Tribune news article. Patrick’s chief of staff, Logan Spence, told us by e-mail that Patrick’s assessment tracks with a Jan. 18, 2011, press release from the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, a conservative Austin-based think tank. The release says the Texas public school system is "the fifth-largest employer in the world with 646,815 employees. It is behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc., China National Petroleum, State Grid Corp. of China and the United States Postal Service." Its referenced study says: "If the Texas public education system were a private company, it would be the fifth largest in the world by employee count." The study says it bases its school employee count on the Texas Education Agency’s 2008-09 pocket guide to school statistics and traces its 2008 counts for the world’s largest corporate employers to a July 2009 Fortune magazine look at the world’s largest private employers--all which we confirmed before obtaining more recent numbers from the magazine and the TEA. And for national perspective, we looked at state-by-state public school employee counts for 2008-09 posted by the National Center for Education Statistics. That year, according to the center, Texas had 660,000 public school employees with California having the second-most, nearly 598,000. TEA spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe passed along the state’s 2009-10 count of full-time district employees, 661,285; she said the agency doesn’t have comparisons to private employers. In July 2010, Fortune magazine issued its latest breakdown of the world’s most profitable 500 companies. Wal-Mart was No. 1 among them in employees as of that date, with 2.1 million workers, followed by China National Petroleum, at more than 1.6 million workers, State Grid Corp., China’s primary power grid builder and operator, at 1.5 million, and the U.S. Postal Service, 667,605. The fifth-largest company was Sinopec, a Chinese refining and gas company, with 633,000 workers. China National Petroleum refers to itself as a "state oil company" and State Grid says on its website that it’s government owned. Fortune says on its methodology summary that entities qualify for consideration if they must publish financial data and report their figures to a government agency. So Texas school districts together had more employees last year than all but four of the world’s for-profit enterprises. Fair comparison? Ratcliffe suggested otherwise, noting that every school district operates independently. A more valid approach, she said, would be to compare school employees with airline employees, or workers in some other industry. We thought of similar analogies: employees of fast-food companies, say, or day-care workers or law enforcement officers. Next, we ran Patrick’s statement by education experts and advocates. Peggy Johnson, associate dean for teacher education at Texas Tech University’s College of Education, said school districts aren’t as monolithic as corporations. "Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart, but in Texas you’ve got very independent school districts," Johnson said, "so it’s not the same as everybody being employed by the same company." Catherine Clark, associate executive director for the Texas Association of School Boards, said in an e-mail that while it’s a "little unusual to aggregate over 1,000 separately governed working units and compare them with Wal-Mart or an international energy company," it’s not surprising the Texas public education system employs so many people. The enterprise is "large, far-flung and diverse," she said. "Its success depends on people--teachers, administrators, and support staff who provide an appropriate education program and safe facilities for nearly 5 million students." Ken Zornes of the 22-year-old Texas Business Education Coalition, which describes itself as the voice of the state’s business community for educational gains, said: "You can walk into almost any business and find some ways to be more efficient. I’m sure that’s true with all the employees in the (Texas) education system." When we followed up with Patrick, he called his statement fair. "It’s a perfectly legitimate comparison," he said. "The point is made: Our schools employ lots of people." Yep, and the math behind his statement looks solid. Still, we find it questionable whether any workforces in the public sector, where the goal is supposed to be public service, are directly comparable to those in private sector, where the goal is to make money. We rate Patrick’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

At a speech Monday in San Francisco, a young man yelled at President Barack Obama and urged the president to overhaul the nation’s immigration system. "Mr. Obama, my family has been separated for 19 months now!" the man said, according to a New York Times report. (You can watch a video of the incident here.) Obama continued trying to speak, but the man continued yelling, saying at one point: "You have a power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country." The heckler was later identified as Ju Hong, 24, of South Korea. The president replied, "Actually, I don’t. And that’s why we’re here." In this standoff, the president is largely correct. We covered much of this ground in a fact-check of Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who claimed that Obama could "basically" legalize all immigrants here illegally "by the sign of a pen." We’ll review the evidence here. In the heckler’s case, he appears to be talking about Obama issuing an executive order to stop deportations. But experts said action like that would likely violate the separation of powers. Congress determines the laws governing how a person can legally reside in the country, so Obama cannot give out green cards, paths to citizenship or permanent residency en masse, experts told us. And Obama does not have the authority to override laws simply by proclamation. "Executive orders have tended to be quite focused, not open-ended over time," said Kevin Johnson, University of California Davis School of Law dean. "Such an order would likely be subject to quite possibly successful legal challenge, with the claim being that legalization would be contrary to an act of Congress, namely the Immigration and Nationality Act." Now, Obama has taken some executive action. In June 2012, amid stalled DREAM Act efforts, Obama announced a new administrative policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation and allows them to work in the country. So far, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has approved at least 455,000 people for this form of deferred action. Obama, however, has said he does not plan to go further. And experts say making the case would be difficult. If he wanted to order a stay of deportations across the board, he would have to provide a strong justification, such as a lack of resources to do the job, said Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas School of Law professor who co-authored an argument against the constitutionality of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. "But he could do that only briefly, and only in what I’d consider pretty extreme circumstances," Delahunty said. On the other hand, the country’s immigration laws grant Obama and the Department of Homeland Security lots of wiggle room in granting temporary work permits and refusing to widely deport people, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. A widespread stay, though, would be "a crazy scenario," he said. Even some of Obama’s loudest critics on immigration policy don’t think he would go that far. "It could be done. Obama’s gotten away with as much, but I don’t think he’d do it," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that is for stricter immigration control. "That would be a bridge too far even for the pusillanimous appeasers among Republicans in Congress." Experts told us they think it’s more conceivable that Obama would chip away at the undocumented immigrant population little by little by building on the deferred action policy for children who came to the country as minors. An expansion would have to come with caveats, such as cut-off dates and clean criminal histories. "It would be the mother of all political battles," said Carl Hampe, a private immigration lawyer who was counsel for the Senate subcommittee on immigration from 1983 to 1991 and worked for the Department of Justice under President George H.W. Bush. "As a purely theoretical legal question, is there a plausible argument that the president has that legal authority? Some would argue yes." Our ruling While giving a speech in San Francisco, President Barack Obama was heckled and told he has the "power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country." Our experts say any executive action that sweeping would violate the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Obama has taken some executive action to temporarily keep more undocumented immigrants in the United States, and likely could do more, but not to the permanent point that the heckler argues. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Obama's heckler	None	None	None	2013-11-26T10:37:58	2013-11-25	['None']

pomt-00920	Rhode Island has invested less in tourism, economic development and economic development personnel than four nearby states.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/mar/01/gina-raimondo/gov-gina-raimondo-says-rhode-island-invests-less-e/	Sometimes, when it comes to Rhode Island's economy, it seems as though the state's motto should be, "There's nowhere to go but up!" Gov. Gina Raimondo emphasized the state's economic problems during a Feb. 18 presentation where she focused on some "alarming" economic numbers reflecting Rhode Island's troubled economy. Many of the statistics were all too familiar. The Ocean State has one of the highest unemployment rates in the United States, some of the slowest job growth in the country, and one in six people on food stamps. But the 10th slide in her PowerPoint presentation caught our attention. The headline asserts: "We haven't invested strategically in areas that spur job creation." The numbers she cites show that Rhode Island is last compared with Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey in statewide tourism spending, the size of our economic development agency budget and the number of economic development agency personnel. Rhode Island is the nation’s smallest state in area, but not in population. We wondered if the ranking would look different if Raimondo had taken that into consideration. We found that it did. We’ll look at each category separately. TOURISM: According to Raimondo, Rhode Island spent just $470,000 on tourism. New Jersey, which spends the least of those other states, spent $9 million. Massachusetts and Connecticut spend $15 million and $13 million respectively, she said. Based on those numbers and the latest state-by-state census data, that's 45 cents per Rhode Island resident. That would be less than half of what New Jersey spends ($1.01) and much less than Massachusetts ($2.24), New York ($3.05) and Connecticut ($3.62). The $470,000 number comes from a Dec. 2, 2014 report from the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, which said Rhode Island spent $468,230 on statewide tourism promotion during the 2014 fiscal year. But that amount fails to include the $6.5 million from Rhode Island's hotel room tax that went to the state's six regional tourism organizations, including $2.5 million to Discover Newport and $1.9 million to the Providence-Warwick Convention and Visitor's Bureau. Smaller amounts, based on their hotel occupancy, go to South County, Blackstone Valley and Block Island. (Similarly, the Massachusetts total given by Raimondo's office fails to include the additional $6 million spent for regional tourism.) If you fold in that money -- and it's all supposed to go toward promoting tourism in at least some portion of the state -- Rhode Island actually spends $6.63 per person on tourism, more than Massachusetts ($3.27) and Connecticut ($3.56). Among the other New England states, only Maine spends more, at $6.98 per resident. The report doesn't contain comparable data for New York and New Jersey, the other two states used in the Raimondo comparison. When we asked Raimondo's office why those regional tourism expenses were ignored, Raimondo spokeswoman Marie Aberger said "spending money promoting South County or Blackstone Valley does not build a brand for Rhode Island in the same way as spending money promoting Rhode Island. We have tourism assets throughout the state (beaches, restaurants, vineyards, historical sites, art museums) and should be attracting people to visit Rhode Island through a smart, coordinated, statewide approach." ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY: Aberger cautioned in an email that "comparisons among state economic development entities are difficult because every state organizes its economic development apparatus differently. Rhode Island currently has one major economic development organization—the RI Commerce Corporation—while other states have multiple major entities." For the sake of argument, we'll stick with the numbers the governor's office chose to use. New Jersey, according to Raimondo, had a $29-million economic development agency budget, the lowest of the four states she compared us with. That's still seven times more than Rhode Island, at $4 million. Massachusetts spent $80 million. But, once again, adjusting for population tells a very different story. When you factor population into the mix, Raimondo's statistic looks very different. Rhode Island spent $3.80 per person, which was more than New Jersey ($3.26) and New York ($3.56) but less than Connecticut ($11.40) or Massachusetts ($11.95). ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EMPLOYEES: Finally, if you look at the number of people working on economic development in those various state agencies, Rhode Island has 33 employees per million residents, more than the other four states. (Connecticut has 28 per million, Massachusetts and New Jersey have 22 each and New York has 16. It turns out that the total number of New Jersey employees -- 200 -- is a guesstimate. According to New Jersey's website, 257 worked for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, but 87 are in the Office of Recovery, part of the effort to disburse aid from Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Aberger said the estimate came from "an expert who served in a leadership role" at the agency, whom she did not name. Finally, when we asked Raimondo's office why the governor's statistics were not adjusted for population size, spokeswoman Aberger sent us this statement: "There are certain baseline costs and functions required to run an effective development agency whether a state is big or small (for example, you would not compare the size of staff in the Governor’s Office in Rhode Island to the size of the Governor’s Office in California adjusted for population size because there are certain baseline positions needed regardless of the size of the state). Because these numbers should not be compared 1 to 1, overall numbers were presented. While it is fair to suggest larger states should have larger staffs and budgets, we certainly shouldn’t be as far behind as we are. In addition, Massachusetts and Connecticut are our neighbors – so we need to compete regardless of the population size." Our ruling Governor Raimondo said that compared with Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, Rhode Island has invested less in tourism, economic development and economic development personnel. That's true in terms of the raw numbers. But if you include all tourism spending and adjust for population size, Rhode Island isn't at the bottom of the pack at all. If you look at economic development, the state has more employees per capita than any of those four other states. It's spending more money on economic development per capita than New Jersey and New York. And its total tourism budget, based on the report Raimondo's office supplied us, is higher than Massachusetts and Connecticut. It's only when you look at funds devoted to promoting Rhode Island as a state and exclude the much larger sums to promote Newport, Providence and other areas that we come in last per capita. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11002	Says Brett Kavanaugh is "pro-Obamacare."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/11/andrew-napolitano/napolitano-court-pick-kavanaugh-pro-obamacare-he/	The nomination of U.S. District Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court has set off a scramble to define where he stands on key issues. Fox News legal pundit Judge Andrew Napolitano gave his take the morning after President Donald Trump announced his pick. "He’s pro-life," Napolitano said on Fox News’ Fox and Friends on July 10. "He’s pro-gun. He’s pro-police, which rankles civil libertarians. He’s also pro-Obamacare." Napolitano’s last point sounded like a break from the other conservative credentials: Does Kavanaugh really support the health care law that Trump and Republicans have vowed to repeal? Napolitano told us that Kavanaugh revealed his position in a 2011 case that challenged a key piece of the Affordable Care Act: the individual mandate and the penalty that came with it. But conservatives split on the implications of Kavanaugh’s opinion in that case, and the legal scholars we reached said they don’t discern overall leanings one way or the other. A 2011 dissent In the case of Seven-Sky vs. Holder, a group of taxpayers argued that the health care law’s requirement to buy health insurance went beyond the legitimate power of Congress. "In a 2011 published opinion on the Affordable Care Act, Judge Kavanaugh declined a reasonable opportunity to invalidate it and voted to dismiss the challenge," Napolitano told PolitiFact. Two out of the three appellate judges rejected the challenge outright, saying that the mandate was allowed under the Constitution’s Commerce Clause. In his dissent, Kavanaugh shot down the challenge but pointedly avoided ruling on the plaintiffs’ big issue. "I do not take a position here on whether the statute as currently written is justifiable under the Taxing Clause or the Commerce Clause," he wrote. Instead, he rejected the claim based on tax law. He said the suit itself was flawed because an 1867 law — the Anti-Injunction Act — blocks courts from ruling on tax laws before they take effect. It was 2011, and the mandate didn’t come into force until 2014, so "a suit challenging the individual mandate cannot be entertained until 2015." Bottom line: He said the circuit court should issue no ruling at all. Kavanaugh spent many pages explaining why the mandate and the penalty to back it up amounted to a tax and therefore fell under the 1867 law. But the real grist for conservative concern came near the end of his long dissent. Since the mandate was a tax, he wrote, "the only potential Taxing Clause shortcoming in the current individual mandate provision appears to be relatively slight." Kavanaugh said "a minor tweak would establish the law’s constitutionality," and offered three legislative fixes. For conservatives like Christopher Jacobs, a former analyst at the Heritage Foundation, this was too much. "Conservatives might argue amongst themselves about which is worse," Jacobs wrote in The Federalist on July 2. "An unelected judge opining on how a mandate to purchase a product could meet constitutional muster, or that same unelected judge giving Congress instructions on how to ensure it will." Kavanaugh’s thinking mattered, because when the issue went to the U.S. Supreme Court, the majority led by Chief Justice John Roberts said that, indeed, the mandate was a tax (although the legal reasons differed from Kavanaugh’s). That 2011 opinion is a legal Rorschach test for conservatives. Also writing in The Federalist, former Kavanaugh clerk Justin Walker said that Kavanaugh’s dissent showed "that the individual mandate is unconstitutional under the Taxing Clause." If nothing else, Kavanaugh’s opinion is subject to interpretation. A technical stance muddies the waters Several health care law professors told us they can’t see any particular leaning on Obamacare, based on that 2011 case or a second one that came in 2015. The more recent case challenged the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that it was a revenue bill that should have started in the House of Representatives, but hadn’t. Kavanaugh found that in fact, "The Affordable Care Act originated in the House and thereby complied with the Origination Clause." Based just on the Kavanaugh’s words, Indiana University law professor David Gamage finds no particular attitude toward the law as a whole. "His decisions involved narrow, technical issues and didn’t involve any assessment of the larger framework of the Affordable Care Act," Gamage said. "It is misleading and inaccurate to describe Kavanaugh as pro-Obamacare." Kavanaugh’s reasoning on the origins of the original health care bill was by the book, "with no additional teeth being added," said James Blumstein, a Vanderbilt University law professor. In the 2011 case, Blumstein said Kavanaugh showed "a traditional norm of judicial restraint." Mark Hall at Wake Forest University echoed that point. He sees Kavanaugh’s opinions as focused on legal fundamentals. "In both cases, he took pains to write a separate opinion stating alternative grounds for rejecting the challenge," Hall said. "To that extent, he appears to me to be more concerned about precision of legal analysis than reaching a particular outcome." Allison Hoffman at the University of Pennsylvania told us "both of these opinions were procedural and offer no insight into how Kavanaugh would have come down substantively on the Affordable Care Act." Our ruling Napolitano said that Kavanaugh is pro-Obamacare. Kavanaugh wrote opinions in two cases involving the legality of the Affordable Care Act. In both, he rejected the claims from opponents of the law based on narrow, more technical grounds. Some but not all conservatives see an openness to Obamacare in those writings. Legal scholars said they saw no preference either way in Kavanaugh’s opinions. In one case, he pointedly said that he wasn’t making a sweeping finding. Rather, he argued that under an old law, the court should wait before weighing in. There is room for people to interpret the meaning of Kavanaugh’s opinions, but on the surface, his words say little about his overall position on Obamacare. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10958	Wisconsin lost "almost 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/23/kelda-helen-roys/gubernatorial-candidate-kelda-roys-falsely-attacks/	Democratic gubernatorial candidates have been taking shots at Republican Gov. Scott Walker since the race began. Kelda Roys, a former state representative from Madison and one of eight Democratic contenders, has been sharp with criticism as it relates to jobs and the economy. At a May 15, 2018 meet-and-greet in downtown Madison, she told those in attendance: "Just last year alone, we lost 4,000 manufacturing jobs." That echoed a claim from a series of tweets on April 18, 2018. In one tweet, Roys wrote: "Households in Wisconsin have paid over $500 for one of Walker’s corporate tax giveaways. Much of the giveaway went to just a handful of the richest Wisconsinites and it didn’t stop our state from losing almost 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017." Manufacturing jobs are critical to Wisconsin’s economy. According to the most recent annual data from December 2017, the state ranks 9th in the nation in total manufacturing jobs -- and those jobs are responsible for 16 percent of total employment in the state. So, did Wisconsin really lose 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017? Campaign admits error When we contacted the Roys campaign to ask for backup to the claim, communications director Brian Evans basically said, "Oops." "The tweet should have said 2016 instead of 2017, and we fully admit that this was an error on our part," Evans said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics and its Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Wisconsin lost 3,726 manufacturing jobs between December 2015 and December 2016. So, if Roys had actually focused on 2016 instead of 2017 her claim would be on target. Even then, that gives a narrow picture of what has happened with manufacturing jobs under Walker. Other years From December 2016 to December 2017, the most recent full year available, Wisconsin gained 8,032 manufacturing jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. This was a 1.7 percent increase in manufacturing jobs, bringing the statewide total to 469,453. In 2017, Wisconsin ranked 7th among states with the highest percentage of growth in manufacturing jobs. While we have the charts out, how has Walker done since taking office? In December 2010, the month before Walker took office, there were 434,723 manufacturing jobs. In December 2017, the most recent full-year available, there were 469,453. That’s a 34,730 -- or 8 percent -- increase. Our rating On Twitter and on the campaign trail, Roys has said Wisconsin lost nearly 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017. Roys has her years mixed up -- and her campaign admits it. While Roys would have been right for 2016, growth in 2017 was roughly double the loss in 2016. Compared to the start of Walker’s term, there has been an 8 percent increase in manufacturing employment. We rate her claim False.

pomt-12215	Says President Richard Nixon held meetings with heads of state without an American interpreter.	true	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/21/ian-bremmer/nixon-sometimes-met-leaders-without-his-own-transl/	President Donald Trump’s private discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit is highly unusual but not completely without precedent, a foreign policy expert said on MSNBC. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group consulting firm, told Rachel Maddow on July 18, 2017, that Trump’s side meeting with Putin at a dinner with heads of state was definitely unusual. Trump met with Putin on July 7 for an official meeting during the summit. But then he sat next to Putin at the dinner later that day with only a Russian translator present and no other American officials. (Trump told the New York Times they "talked about Russian adoption.") But Richard Nixon was also known to hold meetings with foreign dignitaries without an American interpreter, Bremmer said. "Apparently, President Nixon used to do it because he felt, didn't really trust the State Department, at that point, providing the translators and didn't want information getting out, leaking, that he would want to keep private," he said. We attempted to contact Bremmer through his Eurasia Group communications director but didn’t get a response. But he doesn’t appear to be losing much of anything in translation here. It turns out that on a couple of occasions, Nixon did meet with officials solo, although the circumstances were a bit different than Trump’s meeting with Putin. Interpreting Nixon’s meetings Several presidential historians told us that when American presidents meet with foreign heads of state or other officials, there is usually an aide or administration official attending with him. There also is usually an American interpreter present, so that the president may check how the discussion is being translated. "When a president talks business he wants an aide there from his side to take notes," said Nick Cullather, a history professor at Indiana University. "In diplomacy, if there are no notes, nothing happened." Nixon did have a strained relationship with the State Department, and noted repeatedly in his memoir RN: The Memories of Richard Nixon that then-National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, especially, did not get along with then-Secretary of State William Rogers. There are anecdotes that Nixon would keep State Department interpreters out of meetings for fear of leaks, but he rarely attended meetings without some other American official present. University of Texas history professor Jeremi Suri said the aide present was often Kissinger, as was the case when Nixon met with Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai on Feb. 21, 1972, without an American translator. There was a National Security Council notetaker there, and an official transcript was filed. "This violated all diplomatic protocol because it meant Nixon could not check the interpretation of his words," Suri said. Prussian-born Harry Obst, who interpreted meetings for seven presidents including Nixon, recounted in his own book White House Interpreter that he had been barred from translating some meetings with German-speaking officials. One example Obst gave was at the behest of Kissinger, who was born in Germany and could understand German. But the most comparable instances were when Nixon met with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Nixon relied on the Russian translator Viktor Sukhodrev, who worked for the Soviets, during one meeting at a summit between the two leaders in Moscow on May 22, 1972. The meeting was recorded and Sukhodrev took notes, according to State Department footnotes. "There had been concern expressed that I should have a State Department translator present also," Nixon wrote in his memoir. "But I knew that Sukhodrev was a superb linguist who spoke English as well as he did Russian, and I felt that Brezhnev would speak more freely if only one other person was present." The situation was repeated when Brezhnev visited Washington a year later. Sukhodrev was the only interpreter for an Oval Office discussion between Nixon and Brezhnev on June 18, 1973. State Department footnotes said this meeting also was recorded. Both conversations took place during official visits, and administration staff was aware of the meetings. The biggest difference between Nixon’s discussions and Trump’s, however, is that a record of what the leaders talked about exists in State Department records. Bremmer had noted the lack of an official account of Trump’s second G20 meeting with Putin during his MSNBC appearance. "They (Trump and Putin) were out of earshot, so, I mean, unless the Russian translator has a tape — and I think there’s a reasonable likelihood that he does — then, you know, nobody else is going to have a readout of this meeting," Bremmer said. Our ruling Bremmer said, "Apparently, President Nixon used to do it (hold meetings with heads of state without an American interpreter) because he felt, didn't really trust the State Department, at that point, providing the translators and didn't want information getting out, leaking, that he would want to keep private." Presidential historians, historical accounts and Nixon’s own memoir show this was the case. But it’s notable that even in the example most comparable to Trump’s meeting with Putin, when Nixon used only a Soviet translator during two meetings with Brezhnev, official records of the meeting exist.

Candidate Steve Spinnett, who has a long history of community and political activism, says political mailings, one of them anonymous, have made wild accusations about him. He brought several documents to PolitiFact Oregon, and one in particular caught our eye. A mailer from Livable Damascus stated that Spinnett had previous judgments against him for trespass and harassment. "In Mr Spinnett’s deposition," the mailer said, "he stated that he had two previous judgments against him," for trespass and harassment. Trespass? Harassment? That sounds serious. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check it out. First we asked representatives of Livable Damascus for the facts to back up their claims. Randy Russell, who signed the mailer, provided court documents from a 1993 civil dispute he and his wife, Kathy, had with Spinnett over trees removed from the Russell property. The documents refer to a deposition in which Spinnett purportedly acknowledged judgments against him, but Russell couldn’t produce the actual deposition. Kathy Russell said they lost their copy in a flood. A check of public records showed nothing involving Spinnett and harassment. So we’re left with no proof of that claim. Next, we turned to Washington County court records, which show there were indeed two entries, both involving trespassing, against Spinnett. Spinnett explained that the charges came from a peaceful anti-abortion demonstration in Forest Grove back in 1989, through his association with a group called Advocates for Life. Spinnett was charged with two counts of criminal trespassing in connection with the protest. He was convicted of one in January 1990 and spent two days in jail. The other case was dismissed. Spinnett was involved in a high-profile anti-abortion case from the past. Advocates for Life and about 30 people including Spinnett were sued by Lovejoy Surgicenter of Portland for blocking doors and preventing patients from entering buildings. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear an appeal of the $8.2 million damage award Lovejoy won against the protesters. The Oregonian’s coverage of that case notes Spinnett was among the protesters fined $1 for nuisance and $1 for trespassing, in addition to larger awards for the overall judgment. Remember though, the document released from Livable Damascus claims Spinnett had judgments against him for both trespassing and harassment. We have one true claim (trespassing) and one claim for which no proof has been offered, which we rate therefore as false (harassment.) When those two are added together, what does the Truth-O-Meter say? Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Livable Damascus	None	None	None	2010-11-01T06:00:00	2010-10-30	['None']

pomt-08227	Milwaukee’s problems include "52 percent black male unemployment."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/17/marvin-pratt/marvin-pratt-former-acting-mayor-milwaukee-says-bl/	Unemployment in Wisconsin is stubbornly high, but the state overall has not fared as badly as some other states. The most recent federal figures, from September 2010, put Wisconsin’s unemployment at 7.8 percent -- below the national rate of 9.6 percent and double-digit rates such as Michigan’s 13 percent and Nevada’s 14.4 percent. But rates can vary widely from place to place and group to group. In an election-night TV interview, Marvin Pratt, the first African-American to serve as acting mayor of Milwaukee, focused in on black males in the city. Pratt supported Republican Scott Walker in the 2010 race for Wisconsin governor and was asked at Walker’s victory party why he had not backed Democrat Tom Barrett, who defeated him in the 2004 mayoral election. "Fifty-two percent black male unemployment," Pratt said in the interview with WISN-TV, adding that other reasons included Milwaukee’s high poverty rate and Walker’s pledge to create 250,000 jobs in his first term as governor. Pratt wasn’t the first to make such a claim. Less than two weeks earlier, Milwaukee radio host Eric Von said on TV at the 4th Street Forum that the rate was "50 percent or better." And the headline on an Oct. 25, 2010, Milwaukee Business Journal article(later reprinted by BlackAmericans.com and BlackVoices.com) read, "Report: 53% of black males unemployed." The number is startling. At 53 percent, the unemployment rate for black males in the city would be nearly seven times that of the state overall. Asked about the statement, Pratt told PolitiFact Wisconsin a person he trusts told him shortly before the TV interview that the black male unemployment rate in Milwaukee was 52 percent. He then checked with that person and told us the figure -- actually 53 percent -- came from a report by University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee urban studies professor Marc Levine. Indeed, Von’s statement and the Business Journal article also trace back to the same October 2010 report by Levine, who is a senior fellow at UWM’s Center for Economic Development. But the official unemployment rate in 2009 for black males in metro Milwaukee, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 33.3 percent. So, what’s going on here? The difference is what is measured by the federal government’s official unemployment rate and what Levine terms the "jobless rate." Federal approach The federal government defines the unemployed as people over age 16 who do not have a job but are available for work and have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks. That is, people out of work and looking for a job. The unemployment rate is not calculated by using the number of people who file claims for unemployment insurance benefits, but is based on responses to the government’s monthly surveys of some 110,000 people across the country. In the Milwaukee metropolitan area, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, the overall unemployment rate for 2009 was measured as 9.4 percent. When broken down, the rate for black males -- 33.3 percent -- exceeded the rate of 7.9 percent for white males and 11.2 percent for Hispanic males. Levine's approach Levine’s approach counts people who are out of work and looking for a job -- and nearly everyone else. He looks at everyone between the ages of 16 and 64, including those who choose not to work, such as homemakers and early retirees, and those who cannot work, such as those behind bars or with disabilities. It also includes those in high school or college -- even those going back to school for more education to get a better job. Levine’s report focuses strictly on male "joblessness." His approach puts the metro Milwaukee "jobless" rate for white males at 22.3 percent and 32 percent for Hispanic males. Like African-American males, those come in higher than the official numbers. Levine argues that the same approach is used by scholars such as Harvard University’s William Julius Wilson. He says it is better because the official rate understates the number of people not working -- the federal measure does not include the long-term unemployed who have stopped looking for jobs. But Levine’s approach, which he began using in 1990, overstates the number. Indeed, with his approach the rate could never reach zero -- a point he concedes in the report. Levine’s approach has been controversial even within UWM. In December 2009, UWM’s Employment and Training Institute criticized the 2009 version of Levine’s joblessness report for what it said was his "misuse of the ‘jobless’ statistic as a proxy for unemployment." According to the institute, Levine’s report counted 88 percent of 16- to 19-year-old metro Milwaukee black males as jobless, even though most of them were enrolled in school. In response, Levine issued a 14-page rejoinder in which he quoted the sections of his studies that explain the differences between his jobless rate and the unemployment rate. What do others say? Laura Dresser, associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Levine’s jobless rate includes unemployed people who are no longer in the work force. But it doesn’t tell how many of those people choose not to work or are incapable of working, she said. Kai Filion, a policy analyst with the Economics Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said Levine’s measure has greater value during a recession because it includes discouraged workers who have stopped looking for jobs. But it is wrong for anyone to portray the jobless rate as the unemployment rate, Filion said. Yet that is what has happened, repeatedly, with those citing Levine’s report. The result is a distorted view of a serious problem -- one being tackled most recently by the African-American Male Unemployment Task Force, created in 2010 by the Milwaukee Common Council. Let’s bring our work to an end. In his effort to catalog Milwaukee’s woes, former Acting Mayor Marvin Pratt said the city’s unemployment rate among black males tops 50 percent. Pratt said he was relating the finding of a recent UWM study. But that study uses a broader "joblessness" measure than the conventional unemployment rate, and looks at the full metropolitan area, not just the city. As such, Pratt falls into a trap others have before him -- stating one measure as another. We rate the statement False.	None	Marvin Pratt	None	None	None	2010-11-17T09:00:00	2010-11-02	['None']

pomt-12099	"We’ve got dozens of counties around America that have zero insurers left."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/24/paul-ryan/ryan-way-obamacare-county-insurance-stat-cnn-town-/	Republicans leading the charge to repeal Obamacare say their primary motivation is to save Americans from a program that has failed them. That was House Speaker Paul Ryan’s main argument during a CNN town hall broadcast on health care. "Obamacare is not working," Ryan said Aug. 21. "A third of the counties in Wisconsin are down to one insurer right here. We've got dozens of counties around America that have zero insurers left. So doing nothing really isn't an option." Ryan has a point about limited competition, but his statement about dozens of counties without a single carrier recycles an old talking point that was never fully right and has become completely wrong today. The Affordable Care Act set up exchanges where people in the non-group market buy private insurance. The latest official report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is that 47 percent of counties are expected to have just one participating insurer in 2018. But central to Ryan’s claim, that report also said that just one county is at risk of having no carrier next year. Here’s the map: So not dozens of counties -- just one. Now technically, that report wasn’t published until two days after Ryan spoke. But the government had the information, and a day before Ryan spoke, Politico reported that just one county remained without a potential insurance carrier in 2018. The Kaiser Family Foundation published the same information the day of Ryan’s CNN town hall. And a week earlier, the government said there were only two counties at risk of having no participating insurer. Ryan was way off no matter what. Ryan's office said he should have said it was projected to be the case. By the way, on Aug. 24, the last remaining place -- Paulding County in Ohio -- got an insurance company. So that leaves no counties without a carrier on the exchange next year. From 49 counties to zero There’s been a lot of shifting in the exchange landscape. Insurance companies were assessing whether to participate in counties and entire states for 2018. Some places that looked safe suddenly found themselves at risk. Others that were at risk found new companies moving in. At the high point, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said 49 counties had no declared carrier for 2018. Here’s how things jumped around between June 9 and Aug. 23: We asked a couple of health insurance industry observers what was going on. Equity analyst Lance Wilkes at Sanford C. Bernstein said what we’re seeing is a learning curve in action. "All the managed-care companies were figuring out this market, learning about the customer as well the rules of this program," Wilkes said. Wilkes said that in 2014, some large companies such as UnitedHealthcare jumped into the Affordable Care Act exchanges when there was a worry that large employers might shed coverage, sending millions of people into the exchanges. "They needed to be in as sort of a hedge against that," he said. "When that didn’t happen, they got out." But other insurers started to carve out a niche and came in to fill the gap in stranded counties. The Centene Corporation has been particularly aggressive in Nevada and Missouri. Between the two states, it is poised to offer plans in 39 counties that at some point had no takers. Centene has a different approach than many larger carriers. It has a long history of managing state Medicaid programs where it trims expenses by contracting with a smaller group of health care providers. That can work for lower-income clients who don’t come with the expectation that they will be able to see any doctor they want. "It’s a trade off," said Cynthia Cox, who tracks the insurance industry at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "They offer a lower-cost plan but it doesn’t have as many doctors in the network. That doesn't seem to have been a problem for them and their customers." Wilkes said it also helps that state insurance commissioners are motivated to attract carriers and are "more willing to offer good price increases," which about 85 percent of the policy holders won’t feel because the government subsidizes their premiums. For companies such as Centene, this makes the market relatively predictable. "They might be sicker than average, but so long as the healthy people aren’t priced out, you have a pool that’s stable, and you can price for that," said Wilkes. Other companies in other states have also figured that out. Tennessee was looking at 16 counties that lacked any insurance carrier for next year. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee decided in May to cover them. In a letter to the state insurance commissioner, the company said it could do that because it was doing better, with lower claims "and a more sustainable rate structure." Our ruling Ryan said dozens of counties have no insurers left on the Obamacare exchanges. The day he said that, there was only one such county. Less than a week before he said that, there were two counties. His office acknowledged that he misspoke. Ryan has established himself as an architect of health care reform in the House and the viewers of CNN’s town hall would expect him to have his facts straight. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12950	"Donald Trump performed better than any presidential nominee since Gerald Ford."	false	/new-york/statements/2017/jan/06/nicholas-langworthy/trump-performed-best-erie-county-reagan/	President-elect Donald Trump did not win Erie County in the November election. But he did well enough in upstate New York’s largest concentration of Democrats to excite Erie County Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy. "Donald Trump performed better than any presidential nominee since Gerald Ford, and we found that to be substantial," Langworthy told WBFO, the NPR member station in Buffalo. "He carried towns that haven't gone Republican in years and years in a presidential election, towns like West Seneca and Hamburg. And, he won Cheektowaga, a critical town." So did Trump really get better results in Erie County than any Republican nominee since Gerald Ford? Difference in votes Langworthy based his claim on the margin between Trump and Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival. She won 27,153 more votes than Trump in Erie County, according to the Erie County Board of Elections. That’s a tighter margin than in any previous presidential election since 1984, when Democrat Walter Mondale beat Reagan by 15,049 votes in Erie County. Ford’s margin was even tighter in 1976, when he lost to Jimmy Carter by 9,087 votes in Erie County. Number of votes We also looked at the total number of votes the candidates received. Trump received 188,303 votes in Erie County in the 2016 election -- more votes in Erie County for a Republican candidate for president since 1988, when George H.W. Bush won 188,796 votes. Reagan received 222,882 votes in his 1984 re-election race. Ford won 220,310 votes in Erie County in 1976. Percentage of votes Looking at the candidates’ percentage of the vote - not their vote counts - offers a more accurate gauge of their strength because Erie County’s population has fallen since the 1970s. Trump won 44.4 percent of the total vote in Erie County - excluding blank and voided ballots - in the 2016 election. That is the highest percentage for a Republican candidate since the 1984 election, when Reagan won 48.2 percent of the county vote. Ford won 48.7 percent of the vote in his race in 1976. Our ruling Langworthy said "Donald Trump performed better than any presidential nominee since Gerald Ford" in Erie County. When we reached Langworthy to ask about his claim, he acknowledged his mistake. He said he made the claim before he had the official results from the county Board of Elections. "I think it’s significant that he performed as well as he did," Langworthy said of Trump’s vote tally in Erie County. "My point is that Democrats came over to vote for him." Trump won the highest percentage of the Erie County vote for president since the 1984 election. Trump did better than any Republican candidate since Reagan - not Ford. Reagan’s number of votes and percentage of votes were higher than Trump’s. We rate Langworthy’s claim as False.

pomt-09883	White House spokesman Robert Gibbs "lied" when he said President Obama's birth certificate is posted on the Internet.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/28/worldnetdaily/birthers-claim-gibbs-lied-when-he-said-obamas-birt/	Update: We first posted this item on July 1, 2009. Since then, the Birther movement has only gained more national exposure, including discussion on numerous political television and radio programs. That prompted Dr. Chiyome Fukino, director of the Hawaii Department of Health, to issue this statement on July 27, 2009: "I, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, director of the Hawai'i State Department of Health, have seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawai'i State Department of Health verifying Barrack Hussein Obama was born in Hawai'i and is a natural-born American citizen. I have nothing further to add to this statement or my original statement issued in October 2008, over eight months ago." For more information on the announcement, as well as background on the Obama birth certificate issue, check out this article from the Honolulu Advertiser , posted July 28, 2009. Back on June 27, 2008, PolitiFact published a story we hoped would put the whole Obama birth certificate controversy to rest. It ran under the now laughable headline, "Obama's birth certificate: Final chapter." Oh, how naive we were. More than a year later, the debate continues to rage on the Internet among the "Birthers" movement, people who doubt that President Barack Obama is a natural-born citizen of the United States and is therefore ineligible to serve as president. Or at least, they say, Obama has yet to sufficiently prove things one way or the other. The conservative WorldNetDaily.com Web site is the conductor of the Birther train. On the site, you can donate money to rent billboard space that asks "Where's the Birth Certificate?" They've got a petition demanding the president produce his original birth certificate — now signed, they say, by 400,000 people. From the site, you can buy "Where's the Birth Certificate?" yard signs and bumper stickers. The site has recently run stories about a man whose attempts to sell a purported Obama birth certificate from Kenya on eBay have been repeatedly shut down. And on May 28, WorldNetDaily.com correspondent Lester Kinsolving pressed the issue all the way to the White House, squeezing in a couple questions at the end of a daily press briefing with White House spokesman Robert Gibbs. Here's how the exchange went: Kinsolving: "One question concerning what the president said in his speech on Thursday, and I quote, 'I ran for president promising transparency, and I meant what I said. This is why, whenever possible, we will make information available to the American people so they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable.' End of quote. Do you remember that statement?" Gibbs: "I can confirm he said that." Kinsolving: "Good. In consideration of this very good promise of transparency, why can't the president respond to the petitioned requests of 400,000 American citizens by releasing a certified copy of his long form birth certificate listing hospital and physician?" Gibbs: "Are you looking for the president's birth certificate?" Kinsolving: "Yes." Gibbs: "It's on the Internet, Lester." Kinsolving: "No, no, no — the long form listing his hospital and physician." Gibbs: "Lester ... This question in many ways continues to astound me. The state of Hawaii provided a copy, with a seal, of the president's birth. I know there are apparently at least 400,000 people that continue to doubt the existence of and the certification by the state of Hawaii of the president's birth there, but it's on the Internet because we put it on the Internet for each of those 400,000 to download. I certainly hope by the fourth year of our administration that we'll have dealt with this burgeoning birth controversy." WorldNetDaily.com, through an owner, the Western Center for Journalism, responded with an ad in the conservative publication Human Events that called Gibbs' response arrogant, factually incorrect, lies. Moreover, the ad said, "members of the liberal elitist media ... instead of pressing Gibbs on his outrageous statements ... openly laughed." The ad is right about that; journalists could clearly be heard chuckling at Kinsolving's questions. The question here is, did Gibbs lie? Some background: On June 13, 2008, after months of hounding by the media and wild Internet speculation that Obama was actually born in either Indonesia or Kenya, the Obama campaign finally released a copy of Obama's "Certification of Birth" from Hawaii and posted it on the Internet. The document states that Barack Hussein Obama II was born on Aug. 4, 1961, at 7:24 p.m. in Honolulu, Hawaii, to parents Stanley Ann Dunham and Barack Hussein Obama. End of story? Hardly. If anything, it merely intensified the debate. Numerous critics arose on the Internet claiming the document was a fraud. It was the wrong color. It was missing an embossed seal. There was no crease from it being folded and mailed. Our friends from FactCheck.org went to Chicago, held the document in their questioning hands and examined it closely. Their conclusion: It's legit. On Oct. 31, 2008, Dr. Chiyome Fukino, director of the Hawaii Department of Health, issued this statement: "There have been numerous requests for Sen. Barack Hussein Obama’s official birth certificate. State law prohibits the release of a certified birth certificate to persons who do not have a tangible interest in the vital record. "Therefore I, as director of health for the state of Hawaii, along with the registrar of Vital Statistics who has statutory authority to oversee and maintain these type of vital records, have personally seen and verified that the Hawaii State Department of Health has Sen. Obama's original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures. "No state official, including Gov. Linda Lingle, has ever instructed that this vital record be handled in a manner different from any other vital record in the possession of the state of Hawaii." Even the governor of Hawaii, Linda Lingle, a Republican who at the time was stumping for John McCain, said it was on the up-and-up. Over? No way. All that proved, the birthers concluded, was that there is, in fact, an original birth certificate, and that the public hasn't seen it. The new argument goes like this: Obama never published his "Birth Certificate" (a "Certificate of Live Birth") on the Internet; what he posted was a "Certification of Live Birth," what WorldNetDaily describes as "a 'short-form' document that is generated on-the-spot and based on what is contained in a computer database at the time it was printed out." Some on the Internet speculate that the original "long form" — which might include the hospital where he was born as well as the attending physician — might show Obama was foreign-born and ineligible to be president, but that that wouldn't show up on the "short form." Moreover, WorldNetDaily claims even the state of Hawaii doesn't accept "Certification of Live Birth" as proof that an individual was physically born in Hawaii. They point to a policy from the Hawaii Department of Home Lands, which stated on its Web site: "In order to process your application, DHHL utilizes information that is found only on the original Certificate of Live Birth, which is either black or green. This is a more complete record of your birth than the Certification of Live Birth (a computer-generated printout). Submitting the original Certificate of Live Birth will save you time and money since the computer-generated Certification requires additional verification by DHHL." That's actually a misnomer, said Lloyd Yonenaka, a spokesman for DHLL. In order to be eligible for their program, you must prove that your ancestry is at least 50 percent native Hawaiian. And when he says native, he means indigenous. They don't even care if you were born in Hawaii. They use birth certificates as a starting point to look into a person's ancestry. Very different. Here's what the DHLL site says now: "The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands accepts both Certificates of Live Birth (original birth certificate) and Certifications of Live Birth because they are official government records documenting an individual’s birth. The Certificate of Live Birth generally has more information which is useful for genealogical purposes as compared to the Certification of Live Birth which is a computer-generated printout that provides specific details of a person’s birth. Although original birth certificates (Certificates of Live Birth) are preferred for their greater detail, the State Department of Health (DOH) no longer issues Certificates of Live Birth. When a request is made for a copy of a birth certificate, the DOH issues a Certification of Live Birth." When we spoke to a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Health, she said too much was being made of the difference between the so-called "long" and "short" forms. "They're just words," said spokeswoman Janice Okubo. "That (what was posted on the Internet) is considered a birth certificate from the state of Hawaii." "There's only one form of birth certificate," she said, and it's been the same since the 1980s. Birth certificates evolve over the decades, she said, and there are no doubt differences between the way birth certificates looked when Obama was born and now. "When you request a birth certificate, the one you get looks exactly like the one posted on his site," she said. "That's the birth certificate." As for the theory that Obama's original birth certificate might show he was foreign-born, Okubo said the "Certification of Live Birth" would say so. Obama's does not. Again, it says he was born in Honolulu. We have one more thing. We talked to reporter Will Hoover, who wrote a well-researched story for the Honolulu Advertiser on Nov. 9, 2008, about Obama's childhood years in the the Aloha State. It ran under the headline "Obama Slept Here." In researching the story, he went to the microfilm archives and found the birth announcement for Obama. Actually, he found two of them, one in his Honululu Advertiser on Aug. 13 , 1961, and in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin the next day. They both said the same thing: "Mr. and Mrs. Barack H. Obama, 6085 Kalanianaole Highway, son, Aug. 4." But here's the thing. Newspaper officials he checked with confirmed those notices came from the state Department of Health. "That's not the kind of stuff a family member calls in and says, 'Hey, can you put this in?'" Hoover explained. Take a second and think about that. In order to phony those notices up, it would have required the complicity of the state Health Department and two independent newspapers — on the off chance this unnamed child might want to one day be president of the United States. In Honolulu, the Obama tour buses take you by the old Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital, now called Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women & Children. Federal laws prohibit hospital officials from confirming that he was born there, but Hoover said it's common knowledge among locals. So back to the claim that Gibbs lied about posting Obama's birth certificate on the Internet. WorldNetDaily is correct that the Obama campaign didn't post his original birth certificate on the Internet. But their suggestion that there is some significant difference between the two documents is wrong. They both prove the same thing. Maybe the original would identify the hospital where Obama was born, but that's irrelevant. The issue is what city, and therefore country, was he born. The document posted by the campaign proves Obama was born in Honolulu, according to Health Department officials. And that's really the central issue here. The Health Department says the "Certification of Live Birth" is Hawaii's version of a birth certificate. Calling it by other names — Certificate of Live Birth, Certification of Live Birth — is just semantics. WorldNetDaily may be right that the original birth certificate wasn't posted, but if Hawaii says the the document Obama posted can rightly be called Obama's birth certificate, how is Gibbs lying? We harbor no delusions that anything we say here will slow the persistent drumbeat of the birthers, but we rule this statement False.

The host, Steve Malzberg, complained that people don’t know enough about Obama’s background and brought up Obama’s birth certificate. "Don't you think we deserve to know more about this man?" Malzberg asked Huckabee. We should note that back in 2008, Obama’s presidential campaign produced a certificate of live birth, showing that Obama was born in Honolulu. Hawaiian public officials said the certificate was accurate. (Read our many fact-checks on Obama’s birth certificate.) Huckabee answered Malzberg with this statement: "I would love to know more. What I know is troubling enough. And one thing that I do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, very different than the average American. When he gave the bust back to the Brits, the bust of Winston Churchill, a great insult to the British. But then if you think about it, his perspective as growing up in Kenya with a Kenyan father and grandfather, their view of the Mau Mau Revolution in Kenya is very different than ours because he probably grew up hearing that the British were a bunch of imperialists who persecuted his grandfather." Huckabee here seems to be repeating claims made in book by conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza, The Roots of Obama’s Rage, that Obama is a committed anti-colonialist. An adaptation of D’Souza’s book ran in Forbes magazine back in September. The book has received mixed reactions in conservative circles, with both fans and detractors. Obama did not grow up in Kenya and had almost no contact with his father growing up; he never met his grandfather. He grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii; numerous eye-witness reports have confirmed this. Classmates and teachers in Jakarta, Indonesia, and in Honolulu, Hawaii, have shared their recollections of Obama with independent reporters several times. And in fact, Huckabee corrected his statement shortly thereafter. "On Monday, while on Steve Malzberg's radio show on New York's WOR Radio, I was asked about the President Obama's birth certificate issue. In my answer, I simply misspoke when I alluded to President Obama growing up in 'Kenya' and meant to say Indonesia," said Huckabee in a statement on his website. Huckabee’s initial comments were widely reported, though, because polls show he is a leading contender for the Republican nomination for president in 2012. Huckabee has not declared his candidacy and has said he’s still thinking it over. It’s worth pointing out that Huckabee has said several times recently that he does not think Republicans are well-served by questioning Obama’s citizenship. On the Thursday before his radio appearance, Huckabee said at the National Press Club, "I find it unnecessary, useless and frankly a bit unnecessary to get into all sorts of debates over President Obama's religion or the authenticity of his birth. I know for some people that it is an obsession. It is not with me." He said if Obama had not been born in the United States that it would have come out in the primary campaign and that Obama is a Christian. Huckabee then praised Obama as a good role model for fathers: "I have no disagreement with President Obama as a human being. In fact, I'll go so far to say one of the things I respect very much is the role model that he has served as a husband and a father. And I think he has been an exemplary husband to his wife and an extraordinary father to his daughters. Frankly, America needs a good role model like that." Huckabee emphasized that he disagreed with Obama’s policies. "But this is not an attack on President Obama, the person, even though you will see sharp elbows at the policies that he has put forth, specifically, many of the economic policies," Huckabee said. Huckabee did say in a radio interview that Obama grew up in Kenya and then spoke at length about the implications of that, suggesting that his views of the British were shaped by a father whom he only met once and a grandfather he never met. But we should note that Huckabee quickly corrected the record and has notably rejected claims about Obama’s birth place that have been debunked repeatedly. We correct his statement on Kenya for the record here, since his comments have been widely reported, and rate it False.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2011-03-02T12:00:49	2011-02-28	['Kenya']

pomt-01429	"TSA WILL ACCEPT DRIVERS PRIV CARDS FOR ID AT THE AIRPORT"	true	/oregon/statements/2014/oct/07/lars-larson/lars-larson-says-oregon-drive-card-could-be-used-b/	Conservative radio talk show host Lars Larson makes no bones about where he stands on Oregon’s Measure 88 – the driver card initiative. If voters approve it in November, Oregon would join 10 other states and the District of Columbia in issuing driver cards to those who can’t prove they are in the U.S. legally. Larson staunchly opposes the measure and takes every opportunity to say so on his daily broadcast. The claim: He recently sent us a series of emails, which he said verified one of his assertions about the cards: That the Transportation Security Administration will accept "driver privilege" cards as valid identification to board a commercial aircraft. "I have talked to the tsa and have emails to back up the fact that TSA WILL ACCEPT DRIVERS PRIV CARDS FOR ID AT THE AIRPORT," he wrote in one. The ballot title for the measure, however, says: "The driver card may not be used as identification for air travel, to enter a federal building, to register to vote or to obtain any government benefit requiring proof of citizenship or lawful presence in United States." Could the ballot measure’s own language be wrong? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. The analysis: Several newspaper opinion pieces, including one written by former Hillsboro Police Chief Ron Louie, say driver cards will not be valid for boarding an airplane. Causa Oregon, a leading immigrant-rights group, agrees. "Ballot Measure 88 clearly states that it will be issued only to grant driving privileges, and prohibits use of the driver cards for anything other than the listed purposes," spokesman Erik Sorensen wrote us in an email. But Oregon’s Driver and Motor Vehicles Services division added confusion in a "frequently asked questions" document prepared for Measure 88. In response to the question, "Can I use a Driver Card as identification to board an airplane?" the document says: "It will be up to the TSA or the individual airport to determine whether to accept the Driver Card as identification." A TSA spokesman in Washington D.C. wrote to Larson, according to an email he shared with us: "Driver’s licenses are a valid form of ID for TSA." We contacted a TSA official on our own, Nico Melendez, a Western Region TSA spokesman in California. Melendez, after checking with Oregon officials and administration attorneys, said in a telephone interview: "State-issued driver cards would be acceptable forms of identification for our document-checkers at the airport. At this point, the understanding is that a card like this would be an acceptable form of identification." Whether an air passenger shows a TSA representative a driver’s license or driver card doesn’t matter, he said. "What we are doing is verifying that the person who shows the card is the person who is traveling," Melendez said. "It’s not an immigration check." The ruling: Oregon voters on Nov. 4, 2014, will decide the fate of Measure 88, which, if passed, will allow DMV to issue driver cards to Oregon residents who can’t prove legal residency. Supporters and the ballot measure itself say the cards could not be used to board airplanes. But TSA officials – the people checking passengers onto planes -- say otherwise. We rule Larson’s claim True.	None	Lars Larson	None	None	None	2014-10-07T17:46:28	2014-10-02	['None']

pomt-11211	"Illegal crossings at our southern border have been cut by over 40 percent."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/11/mike-pence/mike-pence-uses-outdated-figure-claiming-large-dro/	The security of the U.S. border with Mexico remains a hot-button issue. On April 4, 2018, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum to deploy the National Guard, a move aimed at improving border security. "The security of the United States is imperiled by a drastic surge of illegal activity on the southern border. Large quantities of fentanyl, other opioids, and other dangerous and illicit drugs are flowing across our southern border and into our country at unprecedented levels, destroying the lives of our families and loved ones," the memorandum says. In line with this initiative, Vice President Mike Pence, during a April 25, 2018, speech at the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee said: "Our president also promised to secure our borders and enforce our laws. … As I stand before you today, illegal crossings at our southern border have been cut by over 40 percent." The 40 percent decrease figure is often bandied about by administration officials. Is it accurate? The evidence In January 2018, the Department of Homeland Security announced the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s apprehension numbers for the previous year. "The final border apprehension numbers of 2017, specifically at the southern border, undeniably prove the effectiveness of President Trump’s commitment to securing our borders," said Tyler Q. Houlton, acting press secretary, in the release. "This administration has overseen a 40 percent decrease in 2017 compared with the last year of Obama’s presidency. U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions in Fiscal Year 2017 were at the lowest level in 45 years." But untangling the numbers is not so easy. Let’s step back. According to the Department of Homeland Security figures, in Fiscal Year 2017 the U.S. Border Patrol caught 303,916 people crossing the southern border, down from 408,870 in 2016 -- a drop of 25.6 percent. That’s not 40 percent. We turned to the vice president’s office, but they did not respond to our requests for comment. Meanwhile, a public affairs officer with the Department of Homeland Security said the 40 percent figure is correct and told PolitiFact Wisconsin to "Google it." The officer also cited an earlier fact check by our colleagues at PolitiFact National, which checked this March 13, 2017, claim from Trump: In the first full month of my administration following the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent. Politifact National rated the claim Mostly True. It found that according to a Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2017 chart, apprehensions by border patrol along the U.S.-Mexico border decreased about 40 percent, from 31,576 in January 2017 to 18,754 in February 2017. But that 40 percent decrease refers to a one-month drop. And the figure is greatly outdated -- there is now more than a year of data to work with since Trump took office. The spokesman also sent us a link to a Dec. 5, 2017, National Public Radio article, which noted arrests for illegal border crossings had hit a 46-year low. That article also references a drop, but it reports one much smaller than 40 percent. "Border officers apprehended 310,531 people for being in the country illegally in fiscal 2017, a 25 percent decrease from the year before" the article states. And it provides a slightly skewed picture: The 310,531 apprehensions in 2017 is a nationwide figure. According to the Homeland Security report "CBP Border Security Report, Fiscal Year 2017," of the national total, 303,916 were along the southern border. In any case, that brings us back to the percentage drop we started with. But the fiscal year measure is not a perfect one. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1, so Fiscal Year 2017 takes in the final few months under President Barack Obama. So, let’s try a few other ways. Trump took office in January 2017, when the monthly apprehension figure was at 31,576. A year later, in January 2018, monthly apprehensions were at 25,978 -- a drop of about 18 percent (less than half the boasted about 40 percent). What’s more, the situation flips when you use subsequent months to make the same comparison. That is, monthly apprehensions were higher in February 2018 than February 2017; higher in March 2018 than March 2017, and higher in April 2018 than April 2017. A look at the most recent month-to-month changes -- the approach Trump used in his initial boast -- shows that from February 2018 to March 2018, there was an increase of nearly 40 percent. And from March to April, there was an increase of about 2.3 percent. Our rating Pence said "Illegal crossings at our southern border have been cut by over 40 percent." The most recent official fiscal year numbers show a much smaller drop of about 26 percent. And the latest month-to-month numbers show an increase, not a decrease in apprehensions.

pomt-01261	The proposed mine in northern Wisconsin would be built without any government oversight, and will be nine miles long.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/10/bob-seger/rock-singer-bob-seger-says-gogebic-mine-would-be-b/	The proposed iron ore mine in far northern Wisconsin -- a project that’s attracted international attention -- has been debated and discussed in all sorts of places. But not a rock and roll song. Until now. Rock legend Bob Seger offers up criticism of the mine in a song called "It’s Your World," a track on "Ride Out," his first new CD in eight years. The song, which addresses climate change, includes this line: "Let's talk about mining in Wisconsin, let's talk about breathing in Beijing." In an Oct. 12, 2014 interview with the Detroit News, Seger expanded on his concerns about the Wisconsin project. Gogebic Taconite hopes to build the $1.5 billion mine in the Penokee Hills in Iron and Ashland counties in far northern Wisconsin. The article quoted Seger as saying: "The governor, Scott Walker, passed a bill through the state Legislature on a weekend that there will be no environmental oversight, 'we want this mine.' Well, the mine is right by a river that runs into Lake Superior, which is some of the cleanest fresh water in the world. "But sorry," Seger added, "according to Scott Walker, there isn't going to be oversight, we're going to build this thing, and it's going to be nine miles long." We attempted to reach Seger through his label, Capitol Records, but received no response. Size claims Since we’re checking Seger, who has his own deep catalog of hits ("Night Moves," "Against the Wind," etc.), we decided to start with our own backlist of size-related mine claims: An Al Jazeera documentary aired in 2014 claimed the mine site is "just up the hill" from Lake Superior ice caves at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. It’s more like 54 miles. We rated the claim False. State Rep. Evan Goyke, D-Milwaukee said the mine would be larger than his Assembly district, which is among the smallest in the state (True). And state Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, said the mine would be two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago (Mostly False). Musician and writer Dan Kaufman, a Wisconsin native, raised a number of environmental concerns about the project in an opinion piece published in the New York Times. He claimed the mine "could be extended as long as 21 miles." We rated his claim Half True. To be sure, in terms of its size and the length of time it would operate, the Gogebic mine would be one of the most enormous undertakings ever seen in Wisconsin. Critics say the mine poses threats to surface water and groundwater resources in the Bad River watershed, which flows into Lake Superior. The Department of Natural Resources says it will not approve a mining permit if environmental studies show the pit and related operations will cause substantial harm to the watershed, Gogebic Taconite is at least a year away from filing an application for a permit with the state. A "pre-application" report filed with the state says that the size of the iron ore deposit that Gogebic has the rights to could be 21 miles. But it’s not known how much of that deposit can be mined. The company says the first stage of the project would be two pits. Each would be two miles long. The first phase of mining would last an estimated 35 years. And then the company would have to seek another permit to mine the remaining deposit. So we’re not even half way to nine miles. No oversight? The second part of Seger’s claim, that the mine would be built without "no environmental oversight," is also problematic. State law gives the Department of Natural Resources authority over the mine from start to finish, including exploration, sampling, mining and reclamation of the site. That oversight is already under way. The DNR’s web site devoted to the project shows 15 entries, including correspondence between the company and the state, regarding Gogebic’s plans to take bulk samples from the site. There are nine entries in another section regarding the company’s application for a stormwater permit, and more than two dozen entries under Gogebic’s application for an exploration license. "This is a multi-year, multi-million dollar process before an application can even be submitted to the state," said Bob Seitz, a spokesman for Gogebic Taconite. The next major step for Gogebic is an application for a mining permit. Expected to come in 2015, that application must include the company’s plans for mining, reclamation of the site and details about how the company will handle waste rock. The most important document will be the company’s environmental impact report, which the DNR says must include the "anticipated environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the proposed mining project and analysis of project alternatives." The impact of the mine on the area’s air, geology, groundwater, endangered species, wetlands, aesthetics and socioeconomic issues are among the matters that must be addressed. Once the permit is received, the state has 420 days to review the application. That time frame includes a public hearing and public comment period. "Ferrous mining projects are extremely complex and their regulation involves a host of administrative codes, including but not limited to those regarding wetlands and waterways, air pollution, waste and materials management, wildlife and fisheries, and endangered and threatened species," the DNR’s website says. Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will consider the mine’s impact on the Bad River watershed under the federal Clean Water Act. And the impact of the project on the nearby Bad River band of the Lake Superior Chippewa -- already on record opposed to the project -- could stir legal challenges. Our rating Seger criticizes the proposed Gogebic mine, saying it would be nine miles long and operated with no government oversight. But the size, initially, would be closer to four miles long -- two pits, each about two miles long. And the project will be subject to regulation and oversight on several fronts. We rate his claim False. Editor's note: This item was updated to clarify that the distance from the proposed mine to the Lake Superior ice caves at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore is 54 miles.

pomt-14193	Says Nevada state Sen. Michael Roberson "forced Common Core for Nevada schools."	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/apr/22/danny-tarkanian/tarkanian-misses-mark-linking-opponent-common-core/	The contentious Republican primary for Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District is moving to the airwaves. In a new television ad, candidate Danny Tarkanian accuses his opponent, state Sen. Michael Roberson, of several crimes against conservatism including a claim that he "forced Common Core for Nevada schools." Because Common Core has become a rallying cry for a subsection of the Republican Party, we were curious how much of a role Roberson played in adopting the standards. The ad visually references a vote by the state’s interim Legislative Commission in August 2015, which meets when Nevada’s part-time Legislature isn’t actively serving and approves regulations proposed by state agencies and departments. The Tarkanian campaign sent two articles from the meeting, which saw the majority of commission members approve replacing the state’s former high school mathematics standards with the Common Core State Standards. The standards themselves refer to a group of general benchmarks in English and math developed by several states and nonprofit groups in 2010. Forty-two states have adopted at least some of the standards, and contrary to what Donald Trump says, they aren’t "education through Washington D.C.," PolitiFact has reported on in the past. Roberson did vote for the Common Core math standards, but it’s not as cut-and-dried as Tarkanian’s ad suggests. State education officials testified that the vote was necessary to fix an "administrative oversight" that an earlier approved regulation omitted the corresponding standards for high school math, lost in the shuffle during a leadership change. But Nevada schools began transitioning over to the Common Core standards in 2011, so the committee vote didn’t "force" a new set of standards in overnight. "It doesn’t mean that work that been in place for literally five to six years would have stopped," said state superintendent of public instruction Steve Canavero on what a "no" vote would have meant. Nevada schools fully implemented Common Core standards for English and math in all grades at the start of the 2014-15 school year, after several years of transitioning off the old standards. However, Roberson’s involvement in Common Core is a little more complicated. Common Core in Nevada Changing Nevada’s educational standards requires jumping through some bureaucratic hoops. The process starts with the state’s Council to Establish Academic Standards, a board made up of legislators and teachers who oversee and review the state’s academic standards. That board was tasked in 2009 with developing a set of regulations after Nevada and 47 other states agreed to look into developing a common set of education standards across the states. In 2010, that group and the Nevada State Board of Education both approved the new Common Core standards for English and math after numerous public hearings and workshops and began the multi-year process transitioning to the new standards. This is where approving standards gets slightly convoluted. Though the two state boards "approved" the standards and did the brunt of the vetting work, the final authority rests with the Legislative Commission, which is given authority to approve proposed rules and regulations through Nevada’s state constitution. So the 12-member commission approved the Common Core standards in May 2012 on an 11-1 vote, with Roberson joining the majority to approve the standards. So, it’s technically accurate to say Roberson voted in favor of implementing Common Core in Nevada (even though the ad references the wrong meeting). He also voted for several pieces of legislation that sought to assist the rollout of Common Core, like a study on implementation and aligning curriculum to the standards. But it’s somewhat disingenuous to directly connect Roberson to "forcing" Common Core implementation. Canavero acknowledged that while the ultimate authority to approve the standards lies with the legislators, the vast majority of legwork in reviewing and adopting the new standards was undertaken by state agencies through the regulation process, not by individual legislators. "The Legislature in its wisdom has created a process in law and deferred some of that to regulation," Canavero said. "They have a right to change that process if they collectively agree." State agencies weren’t the only entities supporting Common Core — higher education Regents and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval have actively supported implementing the standards, citing previous standards as lacking. Opponents of Common Core did push for an ultimately unsuccessful bill that sought to "repeal" the standards during the 2015 session, but Roberson never took a vote or publicly voiced support or opposition to the legislation, which never left the Assembly. It’s worth noting that there is a difference between standards and curriculum. Nevada’s Common Core-aligned standards (which are online) do contain tips and suggestions, but the decisions on curriculum, textbooks and classroom materials still fall under the purview of school districts and individual teachers. Canavero said state agencies have held close to a dozen public hearings and workshops on Common Core over the last five or six years, and that education officials have had to battle a "misinformation campaign" that implementing the standards somehow constituted a federal takeover of public education. "I believe it’s a settled matter," he said. "It’s implemented, we’re aligned to it, we’re assessing it. Our students are receiving instruction aligned to these standards." Our ruling Danny Tarkanian’s new ad claims Roberson "forced Common Core in Nevada schools." Although the ad points to a misleading committee vote, Roberson did indeed approve the regulation adopting Common Core standards back in 2012. However, it’s not accurate to claim he "forced" the regulations into schools because the adoption effort started before Roberson took office and was primarily handled by state agencies, not the Legislature. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-03022	"Ninety six percent of employers in the Granite State are considered small businesses."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/oct/11/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-96-percent-employers-new-hamps/	The ramifications of the lingering federal government shutdown have varied in New Hampshire and across the country. With the federal shutdown entering its ninth day on Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2013, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., took to the floor of the Senate to catalogue some of the hardships facing people in her home state as a result. Shaheen said hundreds of federal workers have been furloughed in New Hampshire. Some have been allowed to return to work, but the shutdown is still hitting employees of the U.S. Forest Service -- who work in the White Mountain National Forest -- and is closing down government-backed loan programs. Shaheen said access to credit is the lifeblood of small businesses in New Hampshire, and as many as 20 loan applications from businesses in the state submitted to the U.S. Small Business Administration since the shutdown began are now on hold. "New Hampshire’s truly a small business state," Shaheen said. "Ninety six percent of employers in the Granite State are considered small businesses, and they’re the backbone of our economy." We were curious about whether that figure is accurate, so we contacted Shaheen’s office for clarification. A Shaheen spokesman pointed us to research by the U.S. Small Business Administration. A threshold of 500 employees is used "for research purposes" by the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, an independent advocate for small business within the federal agency. By that measure, small businesses represent 96.1 percent of all employers in New Hampshire, according to the latest available data, which came from 2010. However, the definition of "small business" is more complicated than one might think. For loans and other programs, the SBA uses a more complex standard. The company has to be independently owned and operated and "not dominant in its field." Depending on the industry, the threshold can be either an average number of employees for the past 12 months or a three-year average of revenues. For instance, a manufacturing firm could be considered "small" if it has anywhere from 500 to 1500 employees, depending on the type of product manufactured. Service providers would qualify as small if their annual receipts are lower than $2.5 million to $21.5 million, again depending on the particular service being provided. For retailing, the annual receipts threshold ranges from $5 million to $21 million. Using this narrower definition means the percentage of New Hampshire employers considered small businesses would be even higher than Shaheen cited. According to the SBA’s Office of Advocacy small businesses are "crucial to the fiscal condition" of New Hampshire, providing roughly half of all private sector jobs in the state. Small business statistics are similar nationwide. In all 50 states, between 93 percent and 99 percent of employers are considered small businesses. New Hampshire is actually on the lower end of the spectrum, ranking 44th on the list of states with the highest percentage. Most of New Hampshire’s small businesses are very tiny. About three quarters of them are actually considered "nonemployers," meaning they have zero paid employees. Of those businesses that have workers on the payroll, most have fewer than 20 employees. For some entrepreneurs, government-backed loans are a crucial source of credit to start or expand a business. The 7(a) loan program is the Small Business Administration’s major effort to help business owners who don’t qualify for a traditional bank loan. SBA guarantees to repay the lender a majority of the loan if the business owner defaults on payments. The Provident Bank, which has locations in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, is one of SBA’s prefered lenders for the 7(a) program. In New Hampshire alone, The Provident Bank has at least half a dozen 7(a) loan applications that cannot be processed because SBA has placed the 7(a) program on hold during the government shutdown, according to president Chuck Withee. "The SBA has reported that loans are not being originated, and you don’t need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that if small businesses can’t access capital and credit, that there are real economic consequences," Shaheen said. Our ruling Shaheen said that 96 percent of employers in the Granite State are considered small businesses. Shaheen specifically cited the Small Business Administration and their threshold of 500 employees is a long-standing and widely used definition. Other definitions used by the SBA say a company with as many as 1,500 employees and up to $21 million in revenue, can be considered small, which may defy belief. Under the common definition, SBA calculates the number of small businesses in New Hampshire at 96.1 percent, so Shaheen was correct under either definition. We rate this claim True.

The number refers to the World Health Organization's ranking of the United States as the 37th best health care system in the world, out of 191 countries. In a cheeky countdown, the video shows viewers a cross-section of nations that ranked better than the United States in WHO's tally — a mix of industrialized nations in Western Europe, Scandinavia and Asia; wealthy oil producers from the Middle East; tiny realms of prosperity such as Monaco and Luxembourg; and some seemingly unlikely nations such as Colombia, Cyprus, Morocco, Dominica and Costa Rica. It's an anthem for health care reform that even shows its sources: Hipp includes a shot of himself looking at WHO's report. So he wins points for transparency in sourcing. But as hummable as the song is, we thought it deserved a bit of scrutiny. How did WHO arrive at the numbers? And how widely accepted is the health organization's methodology? Ultimately, did Hipp choose a good benchmark on which to base his song? Observers generally agree on two things about the report. It was a landmark study that attracted a lot of attention around the world. And its conclusions have inspired controversy for nearly a decade. We should point out that the ranking is actually not new. WHO, an arm of the United Nations, published the international comparison in its World Health Report 2000 , and it hasn't been updated since. (Other groups have offered their take, as we explain below.) Five factors went into WHO's calculation: • Health level, as defined by a measure of life expectancy, which shows how healthy a country's population is. This factor gets a 25 percent weight. • Responsiveness, which includes factors such as speed of health services, privacy protections, choice of doctors and quality of amenities. This factor gets a 12.5 percent weight. • Financial fairness, which measures how progressive or regressive the financing of a country's health care system is — that is, whether or not the financial burdens are borne by those who are economically better off. This factor receives a 25 percent weight. • Health distribution, which measures how equally a nation's health care resources are allocated among the population. This factor receives a 25 percent weight. • Responsiveness distribution, which measures how equally a nation's health care responsiveness (which we defined above) is spread through society. This factor gets a 12.5 percent weight. Once these statistics were collected, the WHO combined them into two summary rankings. One, called "overall attainment," is the basic weighted average of the five factors listed above. The other, called "overall performance," took that number and adjusted it for how well a country's health system was doing compared to how well WHO's experts believed it should be doing based on education level and economic resources. Using the second of the two ratings — overall performance — the United States does indeed rank 37th. But using the first factor — overall attainment — the United States does better, finishing 15th. One might be tempted to downgrade Hipp's song for cherry-picking the less favorable number, but Hipp seems to be on solid ground here. The WHO itself considers overall performance to be the more important ranking of the two. In a news release accompanying the original report, the WHO placed the 37th-place ranking right near the top and never even mentioned the 15th-place ranking. So it seems fair to us for Hipp to focus on that number. Of course, any ranking — whether it's U.S. News and World Report 's ranking of universities or the WHO's ranking of health systems — is subject to disputes over what factors should be included. In his 2009 book, The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper and Fairer Health Care , journalist T.R. Reid finds value in the WHO's study even as he acknowledges that it is "all but impossible to design a single rating scale that would accommodate countries ranging from Monaco (population, 33,000; per capita income, $30,000 per year) to Nigeria (population 101 million; per capita income, $310 per year)." Despite some quibbling on technical matters, most observers broadly agree that two of the WHO's five measures — health level and responsiveness — are reasonable. The first statistic gauges health outcomes, which are obviously a health care system's No. 1 goal, and the second seeks to measure how well a health system works when interacting with patients, another widely agreed upon mission. But there is far less consensus over the other three factors. Concerns stem from a mix of methodology and ideology. Glen Whitman, an associate professor of economics at California State University at Northridge, offers one critique in a paper for the libertarian Cato Institute. "Suppose, for instance, that Country A has health responsiveness that is 'excellent' for most citizens but merely 'good' for some disadvantaged groups, while Country B has responsiveness that is uniformly 'poor' for everyone," he writes. "Country B would score higher than Country A in terms of responsiveness distribution, despite country A having better responsiveness than Country B for even its worst-off citizens." Whitman also joins other conservatives in taking issue with the assumption that the rich should pay a similar percentage of their income for health care as the poor do. Because basic mathematics suggests that those with smaller incomes will naturally spend a larger share on highly important items such as food and health care, doing well in WHO's rankings almost requires a steeply progressive tax structure. WHO officials make no bones about their desire to push countries in the direction of aiding the have-nots. They gave the controversial factors that reward socioeconomic fairness 62.5 percent weight, compared with only 37.5 percent for the broadly accepted factors of health level and responsiveness. Tweak the weighting a little bit and a country such as the United States rises or falls in the rankings. For instance, judged on responsiveness alone, the United States ranked No. 1 in the world. A bigger weight for that factor — and a smaller weight for financial fairness, where the United States ranked 54th in the world — would have given the country a much higher ranking. Adding other factors could also change the results. A 2001 paper in the journal Science found that adding just one more variable into the mix changed the rankings dramatically for 79 of 96 countries studied. Meanwhile, Whitman also raised questions about the WHO's "overall performance" measure — the one in which a country's health ranking is adjusted for its education level and economic resources. (This is the category in which the United States finished 37th.) The implication from the WHO itself as well as subsequent news reports, Whitman wrote, "is that the United States performs badly ... despite its high expenditures." In fact, he writes, in the WHO's statistical model, America's first-in-the-world expenditures for health care actually hurt its ranking in overall performance by setting the theoretical bar it had to reach very high. "A more accurate statement is that the United States performs badly because of its high expenditures, at least in part," Whitman writes. Finally, a number of other critics say that WHO listened to the experts but did not measure public satisfaction with health care. A paper published in the journal Health Affairs found the rankings did not necessarily reflect whether people were happy with their country's health coverage. For instance, Italy finished second in WHO's study, even though only 20 percent of its citizens say they were satisfied with their health care system. Meanwhile, Denmark ranked 16th in the WHO report even though 91 percent of Danes say they were satisfied. So while Hipp is right that the United States ranked 37th in the most widely known barometer in the WHO study, it ranked 15th by another WHO ranking and, for one factor (responsiveness) it actually ranked No. 1. Still, this is a rock song, and a well-sourced one at that. So we find Hipp's claim to be Mostly True.	None	Paul Hipp	None	None	None	2009-09-14T19:02:12	2009-09-09	['United_States']
pomt-09168	If voters agree in November to approve a one-cent sales tax increase, that will give "Hillsborough County the highest sales tax of all Florida counties."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/07/david-caton/rail-opponent-claims-penny-tax-commuter-rail-would/	Hillsborough County commissioners last month approved a November ballot issue asking voters if they support raising the county's sales tax by a penny. The proceeds would pay for a new commuter rail system, expanded bus service and roadwork. Critics have attacked the proposal with a variety of arguments. One of the early and persistent assertions is that the increase would give Hillsborough County the highest sales tax rate in the state. Rail and tax opponent David Caton was among the first to make this claim, which has frequently been repeated in debates and forums in the months since. In a Nov. 5, 2009, e-mail, he outlined some concerns about the proposal. Caton is executive director of the Florida Family Association, a group that fights against pornography and gay rights and addresses other social concerns. "This tax increase will have harmful economic consequences which include: •   "Taking more money away from struggling families. •   "Taking on average $250 MILLION each year away from consumer spending, thereby exacerbating unemployment in Hillsborough County. •   "Giving Hillsborough County the highest sales tax of all Florida counties. Our rate will be 8 percent, compared with the 6.83 percent average of all other Florida counties." We wondered, could a county commission whose members regularly tout their fiscal conservatism really be allowing a vote that could give Hills­borough a highest-tax distinction? First, a primer: The state levies a 6 percent sales tax on purchases of goods and services, with exceptions for certain groceries and many other specified items and services. The rate has remained the same since 1988. On top of that, state government allows counties and school districts to charge additional sales taxes. There are a variety of these discretionary sales taxes, with state law specifying how each type of tax can be spent, and capping how much each tax can be raised for each purpose. And not all counties are allowed to charge the same types of local sales taxes. Every county can charge up to 1 percent on goods and services to pay for things like roads, jails and schools — building stuff — and 21 counties do so. Most counties are allowed to tack on up to a half-penny to pay for health care for the poor. There are two variations on indigent care taxes, and only five counties, including Hillsborough, use one or the other. There's another sales tax allowance of up to 1 percent for less densely populated counties, an acknowledgement that they typically don't have the industry that boosts property tax revenue. Counties that have charters — generally the larger ones — can add another 1 percent just for transportation needs. So the 70 cents of tax on that $10 wrench at the hardware store in Hillsborough County is, in fact, three separate sales taxes. You just see the bottom line, which in Hillsborough is a 7 percent tax. Hillsborough residents pay 6 cents to the state on each dollar spent. They pay an additional half-cent, known as the community investment tax, which voters approved in 1996, for roads, jails, schools, construction debt on Raymond James Stadium and other building projects. And then they pay another half-penny for indigent health care. If voters approve the transportation tax in November, the overall sales tax rate in Hillsborough County would rise to 8 cents on the dollar. The Florida Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Relations tracks the various taxes charged by state and local governments. Its latest update of sales tax rates by county was published Dec. 31, not long after Caton put his assertion in writing. It showed that the highest sales tax rate in Florida was 7.5 percent, levied in Calhoun, Escambia, Gadsden, Jackson, Leon, Madison and Monroe counties. Nine counties have the minimum 6 percent, and the statewide average is 6.85 percent. Committee analysts got their numbers from the Florida Department of Revenue, to whom counties are required to report changes. An updated list of aggregate sales taxes by county showed that there were no changes among top sales-tax counties as of May 1. No counties have raised their sales taxes since then, according to the Revenue Department. The Revenue Department isn't required to track prospective sales tax hikes, but its officials are aware of at least six other counties where increases have been discussed this year. In Okeechobee County, the increase would take the sales tax to 8 percent, although those talks are preliminary. Pinellas County officials have been talking about seeking voter support of a 1 cent sales tax increase for transit, but nothing has been decided. That would take its sales tax rate to 8 percent. But PolitiFact has no means of reading the tea leaves on whether the Pinellas or Okeechobee county issues will make the ballot, let alone win voters' approval. And we are ruling now, not in the future. Caton said voter approval of a 1-cent increase would give "Hills­borough County the highest sales tax of all Florida counties." We rate his claim True.

pomt-04284	Says "Romney supported a law that could have made most common forms of birth control illegal."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/nov/02/florida-democratic-party/florida-dems-say-romney-supported-law-could-have-b/	In an effort to sway women voters, Democrats keep returning to the theme of abortion rights. They’ve run ad after ad linking Mitt Romney to some of the most extreme positions, such as banning all abortions -- even in cases of rape and incest. A recent mailing from the Florida Democratic Party broadens the attack by claiming that "Romney supported a law that could have made most common forms of birth control illegal." We have looked at several claims about Romney and abortion, but contraception has received less attention. We gave a True rating to the claim that he supports allowing employers to exclude contraceptive coverage from the health plans they offer their workers. This is the first time we have explored the question of whether Romney backed a law that would have blocked access to some contraceptive methods altogether. The Florida Democratic Party’s argument runs like this: Romney believes that life begins at conception; that is the starting point for legal efforts to define a fertilized egg as a person; "personhood" laws would treat some forms of contraception as murder, so those would be illegal; therefore, Romney supports restrictions on contraceptives. We’ll walk through those steps. The Florida Democrats pointed to the many times that Romney has said he believes life begins at conception. He said it at a town hall event in Iowa in 2011 and on his campaign website. In an interview on Fox Television with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Romney said he would "absolutely" support a constitutional amendment that defined life as beginning at conception. The Democrats also cited a PolitiFact article that found it Mostly True that Romney supports overturning Roe vs. Wade and an amendment on life beginning at conception. But now we get to the most tenuous link in the Democrats’ argument. Laws that say conception gives rise to life are not the same as ones that say conception creates a person. "Saying ‘life’ begins at fertilization is quite different from saying ‘personhood’ does," said Glenn Cohen, a specialist in legal bioethics at Harvard Law School. "No one denies that fetuses or embryos are alive, but many dispute that they are persons." The legal difference is huge. Christopher Tollefsen, a philosophy professor at the University of South Carolina, explained that "to say that something is a ‘person’ is to say that it has a particular kind of moral status -- the sort of thing you can't kill and that deserves the protection of the law." The 2011 Mississippi Personhood initiative is a good example. Amendment 26 stated that "the term 'person' or 'persons' shall include every human being from the moment of fertilization." Had it passed, Amendment 26 would not only have led to a ban on most abortions, its effect would likely have gone further. Since it takes about eight or more days for a fertilized egg to implant in the wall of the uterus and there are birth control methods that prevent implantation, then such a law might well have made those methods illegal. But Romney never supported the Mississippi measure or others like it. He and his campaign carefully avoided endorsing Amendment 26 without actually saying so. After the interview with Huckabee, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams was asked if Romney stood behind the initiative. Romney was "supportive of efforts to recognize life begins at conception," Williams said. Neither Williams nor Romney ever said "personhood." When personhood organizers asked Romney to participate in candidate forums, he declined. He's also been clear about his support for contraception. During the second presidential debate, Obama accused Romney of failing to stand up for women. Obama said Romney would allow employers to exclude birth control coverage from their health plans, an accurate account of Romney's position. Romney's reply was something of a non-sequitur. Rather than explain that position, he addressed a different point -- whether the government or employers would prohibit the use of contraception, which is not what Obama was suggesting. "I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not," Romney said. "Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives." Romney’s campaign then produced an ad that featured a young mother researching Romney’s position on birth control and abortion and then seeing a PolitiFact fact-check on abortion. "Turns out," she said, "Romney doesn’t oppose contraception at all." Romney has argued that since contraceptives prevent fertilization, they never conflict with laws that say life begins at conception. For the most part, this is accurate. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the most common forms of birth control are the pill, (used by 17 percent of women), sterilization (16 percent) and condoms (10 percent). However, a less common form, the intrauterine device or IUD, that is used by about 3 percent of women, is thought to sometimes avoid pregnancy by preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg in the wall of the uterus. Thus, Romney’s argument might not be as simple as he presents. But again, defining life as beginning at conception has not interfered with birth control. Prior to and during part of Romney’s time as governor, Massachusetts law said life began at fertilization. That did not lead to statewide prohibitions on birth control. Our ruling The mailer from the Florida Democratic Party says Romney supported a law that could have made most common forms of birth control illegal. Romney supports laws that define life as beginning at conception, but we have not found that these laws bar the use of contraceptives -- at least, certainly not the most common forms. Personhood laws could limit some forms of birth control, but Romney has not supported those measures. And Romney has repeatedly said he supports the use of contraceptives. We rate the statement False.	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2012-11-02T10:14:23	2012-10-26	['None']

Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, said not many Texans have the state license that’s required to even carry a concealed gun. "We have over 25 million people who live in Texas and less than 2 percent of them have these licenses," he said on CNN on Feb. 22. According to the 2010 census, about 25.1 million people live in Texas. Next, we turned to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Spokesman Tom Vinger told us that "a little over 460,000" people in Texas have concealed handgun licenses. A 1995 Texas law allows adults 21 and older who meet certain requirements, including passing a background check, to get such licenses. Vinger pointed us to the department’s annual reports on active concealed handgun license and instructor counts. As of Dec. 31, Texas has 461,724 active license holders, according to the department’s most recent report, posted online Feb. 14. We also wondered whether other states had a similarly low percentage of concealed handgun-license holders. According to a fact-sheet posted on the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action’s website in April, 40 states have laws allowing individuals to carry handguns, with Florida issuing more carry permits than any other state — 1.7 million. That’s about 9 percent of Florida’s 18.5 million-large population, according to a 2009 estimate by the Census Bureau. So, 1.8 percent of the Texas population is licensed to carry a concealed handgun.

pomt-00138	Says revenues "are actually up after tax reform."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/25/don-bacon/don-bacons-comment-during-debate-tax-revenues-goin/	In Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, claims about the nation’s finances flew back and forth in a recent debate between Democratic challenger Kara Eastman and incumbent Republican Don Bacon. One in particular caught our attention. In a discussion about the economy and tax policy, Eastman criticized Bacon’s support of the 2017 Republican-backed tax cuts and said it won’t benefit those in poverty or in the middle class and will add $1.9 trillion to the federal deficit. Bacon countered, claiming that wasn’t the case. "The revenues are actually up after tax reform," he said. "Revenues are up. We have to work on spending." The Congressional Budget Office projected that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in December, would increase the total deficit over the next 11 years by about $1.9 trillion. According to a recent report by the the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the budget climbed to $779 billion in the 2018 fiscal year, increasing 17 percent from $666 billion in 2017. Bacon has a technical point. Tax collection data shows that overall revenues are slightly up. But the significance of this small increase is undermined once you factor in inflation — and there is strong evidence that tax revenues increased despite the new tax law, not because of it. What the data shows The data does show that, without adjusting for inflation, tax revenues rose between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 — but only by 0.4 percent. PolitiFact has previously reported this rise is smaller than almost every previous year since World War II, except for a few years in which tax revenues declined, largely due to recessions. But even this small increase disappears once you consider other context — such as the flourishing economy and an adjustment for inflation. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors shrinking the federal deficit, found that after adjusting for inflation, tax revenues actually fell by 1.6 percent. (The calculation is for the first 11 months of fiscal 2018, compared to the first 11 months of 2017) Even more important, the role of the new tax law in boosting revenues is diminished once you look at the month-by-month data for tax collections. Three months in fiscal year 2018 were governed by the old law — October, November and December. Another two months — March and April — were governed by the new law, but were dominated by tax payments for income generated in 2017, and thus was predominantly shaped by the old law. A final month, September, had not produced final data by the time of our article. That leaves six months in which it was the new law that shaped tax payments to the government — January, February, May, June, July and August. And if you compare the cumulative collections for those six months in 2017 and 2018, tax collections actually declined by 3.8 percent between 2017 (when the old law was in force) and 2018 (when the new law was in force). The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation, told us the key idea is that tax revenues naturally grow with a growing economy. "The economy has been doing well. Revenues, however, haven’t grown as much," said Donald Marron, an institute fellow at the Tax Policy Center. "So the tax cuts reduced revenues relative to what they would have been, just as every serious analyst predicted." The Bacon campaign said the congressman was, in fact, referring to the increased individual income tax receipts when he made the statement, not corporate revenues. Broken down, individual tax revenues have gone up, while corporate tax revenues have declined. Our ruling Bacon defended the tax law by dismissing projections that it will add to the deficit, saying that revenues "are actually up after tax reform." Revenues did increase by 0.4 percent, but this historically small increase disappears once inflation is factored in. In addition, any causal link between this small revenue growth and the new tax law is dubious, since during the months in which the new law predominated, revenues were actually down. The Bacon campaign told us he meant to say that individual tax revenues have gone up, not revenues overall. Still, he didn’t specify that to viewers. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-05285	Says under Mitt Romney, "Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/24/barack-obama/barack-obamas-life-julia-says-mitt-romney-would-re/	CORRECTION: We first published this item on May 22, 2012, with a rating of False. But readers pointed out we had incorrectly said that the Wyden-Ryan and Romney plans for Medicare offered traditional fee-for-service Medicare alongside a premium-support or "voucher" system for purchasing private insurance. Instead, both plans offer traditional Medicare inside of a new premium-support system, as another plan that competes with private insurance. We corrected and updated our item, this time including the complete sentence from the campaign website. We reconsidered our original conclusion and have now rated the statement Mostly False. "Julia," a character created by the Obama campaign, would be better off under President Barack Obama because of Mitt Romney’s position on Medicare, the campaign says. Its Web cartoon, "The Life of Julia," compares the impact of the candidates' policies on Julia at a dozen points in her life. At age 65, here’s the contrast it draws between President Barack Obama and Romney: Under President Obama: Julia enrolls in Medicare, helping her to afford preventive care and the prescription drugs she needs. Under Mitt Romney: Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan. We wondered, under Romney’s policies, is it true that, "Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan"? Outdated analysis The day the Julia graphic was published online, the Obama campaign released a memo explaining that the character would let voters compare the effect of Obama and Romney’s policies on a typical middle-class woman at each step in her life. It provided more detail on the campaign’s claim that under Romney "Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance" — along with a source. "He would end Medicare as we know it by replacing seniors’ guaranteed benefits with a voucher to buy insurance coverage — a plan similar to ones that the Congressional Budget Office found would raise seniors’ out-of-pocket health care spending by $6,350 a year," the memo said. But reliance on that April 2011 CBO report is misleading for at least two reasons. It analyzes an out-of-date plan, and ignores that Romney has offered his own. We’ll look at both issues in turn. Old plans, new plans First, we should clarify that none of these GOP proposals suggest dramatic changes to Medicare for anyone who’s already 55 or older — so we’re assuming a world where Julia is young enough to be affected. The ad bases its claim on a Medicare proposal from House budget chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., put forward in early 2011. The Julia cartoon gets its number of $6,350 extra per year from an analysis of that plan, which had a tighter spending cap and didn’t include traditional Medicare as an option. Since then, Ryan has proposed a new Medicare plan, released in March 2012, which offers voucher-like credits for traditional fee-for-service Medicare, alongside private insurance options. (Those credits are sometimes referred to as "premium support.") Ryan’s new plan was based on yet another plan released in December 2011 in collaboration with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon — which is the one we’ll focus on here. Why? Because Romney’s plan says that bipartisan plan "almost precisely mirrors" his. (Wyden-Ryan and the new Ryan plan are substantially similar, with a few key differences; see a side-by-side comparison by the Kaiser Family Foundation.) The Wyden-Ryan plan Seniors already pay premiums for Medicare, notably the parts of Medicare that cover doctor visits and prescription drug coverage. Under Wyden-Ryan, seniors could use their premium support payments to help pay for traditional Medicare coverage. That coverage would be among the options on a new Medicare exchange, which would also include private plans that offered "at least as comprehensive a benefit as traditional fee-for-service Medicare." Those plans wouldn’t necessarily supply the same menu of benefits, but benefits with the same dollar value, something called "actuarial equivalence." The Wyden-Ryan plan would peg the size of the payments to the second-lowest-cost plan on the exchange. Whether seniors would have to pay more for choosing traditional Medicare would depend on how fee-for-service Medicare stacked up against private plans. If it were more expensive, seniors would pay more out of pocket to keep it. If it were cheaper, they would get money back. (We should mention that lower-income beneficiaries would get more help than higher-income ones, not unlike Medicare’s current medical and drug insurance coverage.) The requirement that private plans offer benefits of at least the same value as traditional Medicare offers more protection than "nothing but a voucher" suggests, says Gail Wilensky, a health economist who directed the Medicare and Medicaid programs from 1990 to 1992 under President George H.W. Bush. She supports the push for private competition under Wyden-Ryan, arguing it could introduce innovation that boosts care and saves money. But critics of the proposal, such as Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, say that the dollar-value requirement sets up a vicious cycle where plans compete to attract the lowest-risk patients, leaving a higher-risk group in traditional Medicare and driving up costs. Wyden-Ryan attempts to tackle this problem by asking plans with a lower-risk pool to pay into a fund that subsidizes those for higher-risk patients. Aaron says that such "risk adjustment" tools simply aren’t sophisticated enough. "When you're confronted with a vague proposal to replace a vitally important institution, and the sponsors have not nailed down key elements of that proposal, it's fair for critics to worry that some problematic things will happen," Aaron said. Another reason analysts fear that premium-support payments under Wyden-Ryan would leave seniors on the hook for rising health care costs is that the plan includes a spending cap if competition among private plans and traditional Medicare doesn’t keep costs in check. Starting in 2022 — the same time people would start to be eligible to buy coverage from the new Medicare exchange — there would be a cap on Medicare cost growth of 1 percent over the country’s gross domestic product, plus inflation. But the Wyden-Ryan plan — unlike the later Ryan plan — says the government would get savings from providers, drug companies and means-tested premiums, not necessarily by shifting costs to beneficiaries by chopping premium-support payments. That spending cap is similar to the one supported by Obama, but they have different ways to achieve it. The president would merely set the cap as a target, then primarily rely on changes to provider payments recommended by the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which was created by the Affordable Care Act. The Romney plan Meanwhile, the graphic ignores that Romney has his own Medicare plan. While Romney’s proposal in its own words "almost precisely mirrors" the Wyden-Ryan plan, Romney’s plan is even less specific. Romney doesn’t specify the size of premium support payments to seniors, nor how quickly those payments will grow over time. Instead, a question-and-answer section merely says that, "he is exploring different options for ensuring that future seniors receive the premium support they need while also ensuring that competitive pressures encourage providers to improve quality and control cost. His goal is for Medicare to offer every senior affordable options that provide coverage and service at least as good as what today’s seniors receive." That simply doesn’t support the kinds of specific claims the Obama camp makes about Romney’s policy proposal. One thing Romney’s plan does clearly say: "Traditional Medicare will compete against private plans." Just as with the Wyden-Ryan plan, that may be via a premium-support system. But that doesn’t mean it’ll necessarily leave Julia on the hook for extra payments as the Obama campaign’s graphic suggests. Our ruling The Obama campaign’s "Life of Julia" graphic says that under Romney, "Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan." But the bipartisan plan Romney supports includes traditional Medicare among seniors’ options for purchase on a Medicare exchange. It also requires other plans to offer benefits of at least the same value. Finally, it includes a more generous cap on spending growth than the original Ryan plan. If all plans rose in cost, hitting a proposed spending cap, the bipartisan plan says the government would turn to providers and other sources of savings. Meanwhile, Romney’s plan simply isn’t specific enough to justify the statement, "which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan" — a number based on analysis of the original Ryan plan. The Obama campaign ties Romney to an outdated plan with less generous spending growth and no traditional Medicare option. Romney does support a voucher-like system, but the graphic ignores critical facts that would give a different impression about his plan. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-07672	"Roughly 25% of RI has a criminal record"	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/10/direct-action-rights-equality/advocacy-group-says-25-percent-rhode-islanders-hav/	It’s hard enough getting a job these days. Imagine how hard it would be if you have a criminal record. Most job applications have a box to check off if you’ve been convicted of a crime. That alone is enough to turn off many employers. Several lawmakers have introduced bills in the Rhode Island General Assembly to improve convicted criminals’ chances of obtaining jobs. The sponsors, working with Direct Action for Rights & Equality, a Providence nonprofit group that advocates for low-income families and minorities, want to prohibit employers from asking whether a job applicant had a conviction until the employer decides the applicant is qualified for the job. The legislation, patterned after laws in other states, is called the "ban the box" bill. Supporters, who held a rally Tuesday at the State House, argue that if employers would hold off questions on criminal background at least until the applicants are interviewed, they would have a better chance of getting hired. In an online petition seeking support for "ban the box" legislation, DARE (not to be confused with a national anti-drug campaign with the same acronym) argues that roughly 25 percent of Rhode Islanders have a criminal record and could benefit from the new law. We don’t question that helping people with criminal records find jobs is a worthwhile goal. But we wondered whether it could be possible that 1 out of 4 Rhode Islanders actually has a record. We asked Jordan Seaberry, organizer of DARE’s Behind the Walls Committee, where the statistic came from. He acknowledged that his group had trouble finding any local source for figures specific to Rhode Island. As a result, he said his group relied on outside sources. Specifically, he cited Laura Moskowitz, a member of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for those with arrest and conviction records. She testified in November 2008 before the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that there has been an exponential growth in the number of people having contact with the criminal justice system, and in the number of employers conducting criminal background checks, especially since 9/11. Moskowitz testified that 1 out of 5 adults in the United States "now has a criminal record that will show up on a routine employment background check." She attributed that figure to a chapter in a book called "The Gloves-Off Economy: Workplace Standards at the Bottom of America’s Labor Market." The chapter was written by Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of Moskowitz’s group, and Debbie A. Mukama, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In the book, the authors said they got their numbers from a survey of state criminal history record systems published in 2006 by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. That report was based on a 2003 survey that found more than 71 million subjects on file in state systems. The authors wrote that they reduced that total by 30 percent to account for individuals listed in multiple states, and came up with a total of 49.7 million, or 23.8 percent of the 209 million Americans over the age of 18, as reported in the 2000 Census. The authors rounded down to 1 in 5; the Rhode Island advocates rounded up to 1 in 4. Either figure is ridiculous, according to Michael T. Brady, an associate professor in the criminal justice program at Salve Regina University. "I feel that is incredibly high," Brady said. Rhode Island’s criminal record system includes not only the names of Rhode Island criminals, but those of students and others from out of state, and even people charged with motor vehicle offenses. And it has many people listed in the data base multiple times for separate crimes. The people who run Rhode Island’s Bureau of Criminal Identification agree. Chief William Devine and Deputy Chief Robert Chin said the system is not designed to show how many people have criminal records at any given time; it is designed to show whether any individual has had contact with law enforcement. Every arrest is entered. Some people are arrested many times, and each case is entered separately. And they stay in the system. Misdemeanor charges remain for 5 years, felonies remain for 10 years. So when the Justice Department surveyed states in 2006 for their 2003 records, the total number of cases in Rhode Island was shown as 229,000. But Devine, who was in charge of the BCI then, said he is sure that figure does not represent the total number of individuals with records; it represents arrests that have accumulated over years. To illustrate his point, Devine noted that the state has about 1 million fingerprints on file. (Department of Justice figures corroborated Devine’s assertion; the agency reported at the end of 2008 that Rhode Island had 955,800 for the "Number of subjects (individual offenders) in state criminal history file.") But that definitely does not mean that nearly everyone in this state of 1 million people has a criminal record. Chief Devine and his staff estimate the true percentage might be 4 or 5 percent. They can’t be sure of the exact percentage because of the way the data is collected, but they’re certain it’s nowhere near 25 percent. DARE’s statement is based on old, flawed statistics that were tweaked and re-tweaked to make a point. The idea that 1 of every 4 Rhode Islanders is a criminal is ridiculous on its face.

pomt-03042	The Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert program because of the government shutdown.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/07/tweets/tweets-and-bloggers-say-obama-used-shutdown-close-/	The government shutdown has cranked up the volume on the blame game of who is causing the most misery for whom. The latest move comes from the right, where accusations began to fly that President Barack Obama was willing to put missing children’s lives at risk to score political points. From what we found, the claim started in the Twitterverse with tweets late on Friday night, Oct. 4, 2013. "Did u see how the amber alert system was shut down & they even produced a screen to declare it!?" said one. Amber Alert is the system that draws the public into the hunt for an abducted child. The Right Scoop carried the message to a wider audience. At around 5 p.m. Sunday, it posted that the U.S. Justice Department Web page for the Amber Alert program was down. "I’m sure you care about your lost child but Obama doesn’t – at least not while he’s trying to ‘win’ the government shutdown," the blog post said. The Drudge Report put that item on its homepage with the headline, "Amber Alert website shut down, Michelle’s ‘Let’s Move’ stays up." By the next morning, the Washington Examiner’s Mark Tapscott had an article titled, "Obama shutters Amber Alerts as government shutdown enters second week." "Somebody, somewhere in the Obama White House or the Obama Justice Department decided to shut down the Amber Alerts, despite the system's long and stellar record of helping locate missing children," Tapscott wrote. Two congressmen, Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn, and Steve Stockman, R-Texas, added their own tweets into the mix, echoing the theme that Obama was playing politics with kids. By mid-morning Monday, the government Web page was back up, but chastising tweets continued. We decided to check out exactly what had been shut down, and by whom. Federal action If you went to the federal Amber Alert Web page on Sunday, you would have found this message "Due to the lapse in Federal funding, this Office of Justice Program website is unavailable." That is what triggered the blog postings, tweets and articles. A Justice Department spokesperson explained to the Huffington Post, "All the sites that had to go offline were put behind a firewall so that they couldn't be hacked while the IT people were on furlough." The spokesman said a furloughed worker was brought back Monday to put the site back online. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gave the reason for that move at his press briefing later that day. "To eliminate any confusion among the public about the status of the program. A furloughed Justice Department employee was called in to work in order to restore the informational site," Carney said. "But again, it’s informational. The system itself was never interrupted." We contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit that assists local and state authorities in this work. According to their data, over this weekend, at the same time the tweets and blog posts were building, the Amber Alert was activated twice: in Texas on Oct. 4 and in Florida on Oct. 5. At the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, spokesperson Gretl Plessinger said the news stories about the federal website had prompted some people to call out of concern. Plessinger reassured the public that Florida's program "is operating as it always has." We also got in touch with Gene Thaxton of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, who coordinates the Amber Alert system for that state. Thaxton was emphatic that the program never closed. "Oklahoma has its own Amber Alert program, and it is not affected by the government shutdown," he said. "The federal Web page is informational. It doesn’t affect the operations of the program." To be clear, the Amber Alert system is not run by Washington. States set up their own programs and use guidelines and standards that are shared nationwide. The program is a network of these state-run operations. At the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, spokesman Bob Hoever told us that the federal Web page plays no role in actually finding children. Hoever said local or state law enforcement officials trigger an Amber Alert when authorities have details like the name of the child, a photo of the child, the kind of car involved, a plate number, or a photo of the suspect. "Those are the things that have led to a rescue in the past," he said. State authorities then notify the media and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The center spreads the word through the Web and over cell phones, sending automatic text messages to everyone with a smart phone in the area where officials think the child might be. "We had a case in Minnesota where a teenager read the text on her phone, and there across the street was the car," Hoever said. "She told her dad, and he called the police, and they rescued the child." Hoever said as far as he knows, from the initial investigation to the public reports of a possible sighting, the federal website has never been involved. "If people knew how this worked, we wouldn’t be dealing with this confusion," he said. Our ruling People on Twitter, bloggers and others said the Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert system. Actually, each state has its own alert system, and national coordination takes place through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit, untouched by the federal stalemate. The system has continued to operate through the federal shutdown, sending out alerts in Texas and Florida. The one sliver of truth that triggered this claim is that a federal webpage promoting the program was closed, but that did not affect the program itself. It is a mistake to confuse that web page with the Amber Alert system. We rate the statement False.	None	Tweets	None	None	None	2013-10-07T18:48:33	2013-10-04	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-05185	Says Barack Obama’s regulatory adviser Cass Sunstein, "wants to ban hunting and says animals should be represented in court."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/13/national-rifle-association/obama-regulatory-cass-sunstein-wants-ban-hunt/	We have to admit: We don’t know a whole lot about Cass Sunstein, Barack Obama’s regulatory adviser, other than he’s become kind of a whipping boy for conservative causes. The latest example comes from the National Rifle Association. The NRA is singling out the Obama aide in a flier explaining why the president is bad for the Second Amendment. We’re checking several claims from the NRA’s mailer, titled "Ten Reasons Why Obama is Bad News for the Second Amendment." You can see all our fact-checks by clicking back here throughout the week. The attack leveled against Sunstein -- administrator of the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs -- is that he "wants to ban hunting and says animals should be represented in court." We’ve heard part of this claim before, from NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, who used Sunstein to paint the Obama administration as out of touch back in 2009. "Sunstein is a radical animal rights extremist who makes PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) look like cheerleaders with pooper-scoopers," LaPierre said. How extreme? LaPierre said Sunstein is "a man who wants to give legal standing to animals so they can sue you for eating meat." That’s basically the second half of the claim in the mailer -- though the mailer’s tone is tamped down a bit. The evidence comes from Sunstein's 2004 book Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions. Chapter 11 is titled "Can Animals Sue?" "My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law," Sunstein writes. "I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law." Sunstein argues that abused animals should be able to be represented in courts by humans. That’s a little more nuanced than the NRA mailer lets on, but the mailer basically gets the point correct. As for the other part of the NRA mailer -- than Sunstein wants to ban hunting -- that comes from remarks Sunstein delivered at Harvard University in 2007. In his speech, Sunstein repeats the idea that human beings ought to be able to act on the behalf of abused animals in the court system. He then discusses ways to close gaps in current anti-animal cruelty laws and notes that hunters are almost always excluded from animal cruelty laws (here’s unedited video of Sunstein’s remarks; he begins speaking about 40 minutes in). "We ought to ban hunting, I suggest, if there isn't a purpose other than sport or fun. That should be against the law. It’s time now," Sunstein says. We listened to huge portions of the video around Sunstein’s "ban hunting" remarks. It’s clear Sunstein is attempting to be provocative, and he notes that some of proposals could be hard to accept. Still, that's what he said. Republican senators were concerned enough by Sunstein’s statements on both the rights of animals in court and banning hunting to initially put a hold on his 2009 nomination. That forced Sunstein to address his statements, first privately in a meeting with Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and then in a July 14, 2009, letter. On hunting, Sunstein wrote: "I strongly believe that the Second Amendment creates an individual right to possess and use guns for purposes of both hunting and self-defense … If confirmed, I would respect the Second Amendment and the individual right that it recognizes." On the ability of animals to be represented in court: "Let me be very clear: If confirmed, I would not take any steps to promote litigation on behalf of animals. In particular, federal law does not create an individual right to bring lawsuits, on behalf of animals, against agriculture. I do not favor and would not promote such a right." Sunstein was confirmed by the Senate 57-40 on Sept. 10, 2009. We reached out to the NRA but did not hear back. Our ruling For the most part, the NRA accurately summarizes Sunstein’s position in his 2004 book and his 2007 speech at Harvard. But the group ignores the most recent statements Sunstein made on both issues as part of his 2009 confirmation. Sunstein said he would respect people’s right to hunt -- though that doesn’t mean he still doesn’t want to ban the practice. His about-face was more evident when it comes to the right of an individual to sue on behalf of animal. Contradicting his earlier statements, he said he does not favor changing federal law. Those details are missing from the NRA’s latest attack. We rate this claim Half True.	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2012-06-13T15:19:39	2012-06-11	['None']

pomt-08635	Harry Reid has voted "to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-calls-harry-reid-best-friend-illegal/	The relentlessly negative Senate race in Nevada that pits incumbent Democratic leader Harry Reid and Republican challenger Sharron Angle continued with Angle's release of a new ad on Sept. 14, 2010. The ad targets Reid's record on illegal immigration, calling him "the best friend an illegal alien ever had." In this item, we'll focus on the part where the narrator says, "Harry Reid -- he votes to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens...." We'll check whether Reid voted "to give illegals Social Security" in a separate item. The ad itself doesn't list citations or other supporting evidence for the claim about tax breaks, but the Angle campaign provided us with a backup document after we asked for one. Here are the key pieces of evidence they cite, all of which are votes on amendments to bills. 1. A May 25, 2006, amendment by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., that was offered during the debate over an immigration reform bill that would have created a path to legal status for illegal immigrants. Sessions' amendment was designed to prohibit illegal immigrants, and illegal immigrants who would have secured legal status under the bill, from claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit. The EITC is a three-decade old provision of the tax code that encourages low-income Americans to work by giving them refundable tax credits when they earn money from being employed. It is available to taxpayers whose income falls below a certain threshold. The amendment was defeated, with just 37 votes in favor. Reid voted against the amendment, along with 21 Republicans. However, this amendment was not actually targeted directly at illegal aliens, as the ad suggests. It targeted two groups -- illegal immigrants (who were already barred by existing law from collecting the EITC) and former illegal aliens who would have been able to secure legal status under the bill (and thus would not have been illegal any more). This vote also carries with it a separate problem for Angle. It's not clear to us that the vote was about providing "special tax breaks," as the ad termed it. To us, a "special tax break" implies a special status granted by the government. In reality, what the amendment said it would do is take away a right for which these taxpayers would have otherwise qualified -- creating a "special tax penalty," if you will. You can disagree over the merits of the amendment, but we don't buy that Reid's vote against it amounted to supporting a "special tax break." 2. Another amendment offered on May 25, 2006 during the immigration debate, this one by Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev. This amendment was designed to bar illegal immigrants applying for legal status from receiving "any tax refund for any taxable year prior to 2006, or to file any claim for the Earned Income Tax Credit, or any other tax credit otherwise allowable under the tax code." The amendment passed, 50-47, with Reid -- and 11 Republicans -- voting against it. This amendment comes closer to the ad's claim of being aimed at illegal immigrants: It affected illegal immigrants who would have been able to apply for legal status had the bill passed, and who then might have eventually become legal. But the amendment has the same problem of not really being a "special tax break." In addition, Vote 2 did something else entirely -- it prevented illegal immigrants applying for legal status from receiving a refund, which means they would be unable to get back from the IRS the money that they had overpaid as taxes. 3. An amendment offered during the following year's immigration debate by Reid himself. The June 6, 2007, amendment was intended to clarify that nothing in the immigration overhaul or its amendments would change the Internal Revenue Code's prohibition on illegal aliens qualifying for the Earned Income Tax Credit. The amendment passed, 57-40, with Reid, and eight Republicans, voting for it. This amendment seems to reiterate the existing prohibition on illegal immigrants earning the EITC, countering the Angle camp's claim rather than supporting it. 4. Finally, an amendment offered on June 6, 2007, by Sessions. The amendment would prohibit those who were granted "Y" visas under the bill's temporary guest worker program from claiming the EITC. The amendment passed, 56-41, with Reid, along with six Republicans, voting against it. This amendment was aimed at people who had been granted legal status as temporary work visa holders -- not illegals, so it doesn't seem very relevant to a discussion of votes that aided illegal aliens. (We should add that neither the 2006 nor 2007 immigration reform bills became law.) So, how persuasive are these four examples of Reid voting "to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens"? They didn't persuade us. We'll agree that it's fair for Angle to paint Reid as something less than Draconian in his stance toward former illegal immigrants. However, we find little to support the charge that Reid voted to "give special tax breaks to illegal aliens." Most of the Angle camp's cited votes were actually aimed at people in the U.S. legally (even though they may formerly have been illegal), and in at least two cases, we disagree that what was being voted on represented a "special tax break" at all. The combination of these concerns lead us to rate this claim False.	None	Sharron Angle	None	None	None	2010-09-17T13:55:19	2010-09-14	['Harry_Reid']
pomt-10418	"Privatizing Social Security was a bad idea when George W. Bush proposed it. It's a bad idea today. Sen. McCain's campaign went even further ... suggesting ... to cut cost-of-living adjustments or to raise the retirement age."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/22/barack-obama/reading-too-much-into-mccains-ambitions/	Continuing his efforts to link Sen. John McCain to President Bush's most unpopular economic policies, Sen. Barack Obama is accusing the presumptive Republican presidential nominee of harboring ambitions to overhaul Social Security by, among other things, reviving Bush's attempt to create personal retirement accounts — a plan critics refer to as "privatization." "Privatizing Social Security was a bad idea when George W. Bush proposed it. It's a bad idea today. It would cost a trillion dollars to implement at the front end, and would put the retirement plans of millions of Americans at risk on a volatile Wall Street. That's why I stood up against this plan in the Senate, and that's why I won't stand for it as president," Obama said in a speech in Gresham, Ore., on May 18, 2008. "Sen. McCain's campaign went even further a few weeks ago, suggesting that the best answer to the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut cost-of-living adjustments or to raise the retirement age." Though McCain has repeatedly warned that the Social Security system is going broke and needs to be fixed to meet the needs of future generations, he is not proposing anything as ambitious — or as concrete — as what Bush attempted in 2005. At the time, Bush tried to make the case for diverting a portion of the program's payroll taxes to create personal investment accounts in order to reduce retirees' reliance on guaranteed Social Security benefits and keep the system solvent as tens of millions of baby boomers retire. The thinking was private accounts would give younger workers the ability to manage their retirement nest eggs, without government interference. But though Bush did a good job persuading the public the program was in trouble, he couldn't sell them on his solution. Large majorities rejected the idea of revamping a venerable program that has essentially delivered on all of its promises and kept a great number of senior citizens out of poverty. McCain, mindful of the passions Social Security debates tend to arouse, is vague about his plans for the program. His Web site says he wants to supplement the current system with personal accounts but adds the accounts will not be a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept. It also notes McCain wants to work with Democrats on a Social Security plan but is prepared to go it alone if they don't want to play. Experts say McCain appears to back allowing workers to invest a portion of their paychecks in new tax-advantaged investments without tapping money currently dedicated to Social Security. "That's very different from taking money out of Social Security and making a personal account part of today's benefit structure," said David C. John, a senior research fellow and Social Security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Politically, it (Obama's charge) is understandable, but factually, what McCain is proposing is different." Obama's remarks also imply McCain is pondering other steps to shore up the system, such as raising the retirement age (currently 67 for individuals born in 1960 or later) or cutting benefits by slowing the annual indexing of benefits to keep pace with inflation. Both options were raised by McCain's chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, in a March 2008 interview with the Wall Street Journal. But Holtz-Eakin added no final decisions have been made. Obama has proposed his own fixes, chiefly raising the cap on workers' wages subject to Social Security taxes, which currently stands at $102,000. The proposal has the appeal of generating more immediate revenue for the system, though projections by the Social Security Administration show it would be only a temporary fix. McCain's campaign has derided the Illinois senator for proposing to raise taxes on middle-income Americans to solve the problem. Obama is largely correct in his assessment of some aspects of Bush's Social Security plan. Estimates put its up-front cost in excess of $1-trillion because it would force the government to borrow money in order to pay current and near-retirees the benefits they are guaranteed under law while new personal accounts are established for younger workers.

pomt-02369	The United States has seen "a net loss of people with health insurance" because of Obamacare.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/18/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-more-people-are-uninsured-obamac/	For a law that will be judged, in part, by how many uninsured Americans gain coverage, it’s a pretty bold statement when the most powerful Republican in Washington claims the Affordable Care Act is leading to more people without coverage. In a press conference on March 13, 2014, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, claimed "there are less people today with health insurance than there were before this law went into effect." A reporter later asked him if he really meant that. Boehner doubled down. "I believe that to be the case," Boehner said. "When you look at the 6 million Americans who've lost their policies, and (government officials) claim 4.2 million who've signed up — I don't know how many have actually paid for it — that would indicate to me a net loss of people with health insurance. And I actually do believe that to be the case." There are a lot of holes in the administration’s data for new signups. Further clouding the stats are fluctuations in the existing insurance market caused when insurance companies canceled plans that didn’t meet Obamacare’s coverage standards. But to say that has resulted in a net loss is a stretch. The Washington Post Fact Checker beat us to the punch on this. He gave Boehner’s comment Four Pinocchios, his worst rating. We have looked at similar claims before. We mostly heard it late last year, when several million Americans received notices from their insurance provider that their current policies would no longer be offered. Since it came from Boehner, though, we decided it was worth looking into again. Polls and projections We took the issue first to Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck. He offered this explanation: "The speaker explained the statement at the presser: More people have had plans canceled than signed up, especially when considering how inflated the enrollment numbers appear to be." But that's not what Boehner said. He twice claimed that the number of people with insurance overall is down since the health care law went into effect, a considerably more audacious statement. While there isn't a final tally that looks at those numbers yet, Boehner's assertion goes against a recent Gallup poll, which said the number of uninsured Americans declined from 17.1 percent at the end of last year to 15.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014, the lowest level since 2008. Also, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan policy scorekeeper, estimates over time that the percentage of insured Americans will rise as a result of the health care law. Boehner claimed the math, though, is simple. According to him, there were 6 million people told their policies were canceled because they didn't meet the health law's minimum benefits and coverage. And the administration announced that through February, 4.2 million had purchased insurance through the state and federal marketplaces. (A few days after Boehner spoke, the administration announced enrollment through the marketplace surpassed 5 million.) By that logic, 1.8 million people must have lost insurance. But Boehner misses a lot of important factors. We'll go through them one by one. What happened to canceled plans There were many Americans notified that their insurance plans were canceled because they did not meet Obamacare's standards of coverage, despite promises that wouldn't happen. Boehner puts this at 6 million. It's a hard figure to pin down exactly. Through an extensive reporting project, the Associated Press found at least 4.7 million Americans received notices about canceled policies; it could be higher. Some of those policies, about half, were restored when Obama administratively allowed canceled plans to continue for another year and later through 2016. Many others were moved to new plans, either through their insurance company or by purchasing a new policy on the marketplaces set up for Obamacare. The administration estimated that of the people with canceled plans, just 500,000 were left without coverage, and catastrophic coverage was extended to those individuals. That's not to say this wasn't a difficult ordeal for people who lost their plans, especially if they thought the law would allow them to keep their coverage. But most of them were able to find new plans, meaning Boehner's 6 million uninsured people basically vanishes. We could probably stop there, but let's dissect the rest of the numbers, since this is a debate that won't subside any time soon. Marketplace signups Boehner also casts doubt that the administration's figures for new insurance purchases is inflated, which they put at 4.2 million (now 5 million). He does have a point there. First, many of the people who lost coverage due to Obamacare were shifted to the marketplace to buy coverage. Just as those individuals shouldn't be included in Boehner's figure of people without insurance, they also don't count as a net gain, since they previously had insurance. It's ultimately difficult to tell how many people who bought insurance didn’t have coverage last year. A survey by McKinsey & Company found that 27 percent of the people who reported buying a new policy in February for 2014 were previously uninsured. It's equally difficult to know how many of the people who bought plans actually paid their premiums. The New York Times reported that 20 percent of people buying insurance on the exchanges never made their first payment. The McKinsey & Company survey reported similar results for the previously uninsured. So Boehner's skepticism toward that 4.2 million figure is not misguided. But even if it includes a lot of people who didn't pay their premiums or people who were previously insured, there were some previously uninsured people who found and paid for policies. That alone makes it a net gain. It also doesn't include the people who are buying insurance directly from insurance companies or through other Obamacare approved third-party sites. In Washington state, for example, 184,000 of the 300,000 projected new enrollees bought coverage outside the marketplace. Medicaid Boehner also completely ignores individuals who gained coverage through the expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health care program. The administration says 4.4 million people were deemed eligible for Medicaid when signing up for coverage through the marketplace. That doesn't count all of the people who signed up through local state offices, not through an exchange. But it also includes those who were assessed as eligible but didn’t complete the sign up. There could be duplication in the process as well. But whatever the actual number is, it still points toward a net gain in insured Americans. Kids up to 26 One of the earliest provisions of the law to take affect allowed children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26. The administration has estimated 3.1 million young adults took advantage of this change. The Washington Post Fact Checker noted the number hasn't been updated for a number of years and questioned whether it was that high. Not all of those children were previously uninsured. And presumably some of those initial sign ups could have aged out of their parents insurance by now. It's possible many were included among the previously insured who transitioned to the marketplace. But like the Medicaid number, for the purpose of this check the actual number isn't as significant as knowing there are a lot of young adults that gained insurance through this provision. Our ruling Boehner said the Affordable Care Act so far has caused "a net loss of people with health insurance." Boehner's logic is based on reports that about 5 million had their insurance policies canceled while 4.2 million signed up for policies on the state and federal marketplaces. It's bad math for two reasons. First, most of the people who lost their insurance have seen those policies extended to them through an administrative fix, or they received new coverage through their previous insurer or they bought a new plan. Second, he ignores the millions of people who bought coverage off the exchange, those who gained coverage through Medicaid and the under-26 crowd able to remain on their parents' insurance. We don't yet know how many new Americans will ultimately gain coverage. But every indicator right now suggests it will be a net gain. We rate Boehner's statement False.

pomt-05455	"The University of Florida announced this past week that it was dropping its computer science department ... Meanwhile, the athletic budget for the current year is $97.7 million, an increase of more than $2 million from last year."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/apr/24/forbes-blog/university-florida-eliminates-computer-science-dep/	Even the most die-hard Gators sports fan would probably agree: giving the athletic program at the University of Florida close to $100 million while cutting an engineering program to save a little more than $1 million doesn’t seem quite fair. Yet that was the claim, widely circulated in an online Forbes magazine post over the weekend headlined "University of Florida Eliminates Computer Science Department, Increases Athletic Budgets. Hmm." "The University of Florida announced this past week that it was dropping its computer science department," the blog post said. "Meanwhile, the athletic budget for the current year is $97.7 million, an increase of more than $2 million from last year. The increase alone would offset the savings supposedly gained by cutting computer science." The article, written by Forbes contributor Steven Salzberg, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Medicine, quickly gained traction on social networking sites, getting posted, re-posted and commented on hundreds of times. Salzberg said even he was surprised at the attention it got. But is the claim true? Is UF really cutting computer science to save the same amount of money that it's adding to athletics? Couldn’t the university use the extra sports money to fund the academic program? It's true that UF is struggling with budget cuts while athletic funding is up. But the blog post details are questionable. The computer science program isn't going away, for example. And it's not quite so easy for the university to move money from athletics to academics. Salzberg told us he got his information from various news articles and the UF athletic budget, which he found by searching online. Budget documents for the UF Athletic Association show that total expenditures for 2011-2012 were $97.7 million, about $2 million more than the year before. Meanwhile, UF is attempting to save $1.4 million by overhauling one of its engineering departments. But the department, Computer & Information Science and Engineering, isn’t being eliminated. Instead, UF is considering merging it with another department, Electrical and Computer Engineering. No one's major would change, and course offerings would remain the same. But many of the program’s teaching assistant positions would be eliminated, with faculty taking on a greater teaching role in the consolidation, the university says. The idea sparked campus protests when it was made public a couple weeks ago. It’s part of a total $4 million cut that the engineering college has to deal with, its share of a $36.4 million cut to the university — which is UF’s share of a $300 million cut to higher education statewide. Cammy Abernathy, dean of UF’s engineering college, said she understands people’s frustrations. Nobody likes budget cuts, she told PolitiFact Florida. "It’s painful." Still, she believes the reorganization would make the best of the situation. "We looked for areas where we had duplication or overlap," Abernathy said. That sentiment was echoed in a statement released by UF, in response to the Forbes article: "The Dean of the College of Engineering has put on the table for discussion a budget plan to reorganize the Computer & Information Science and Engineering Department. Under that proposal, all undergraduate and graduate degree curriculum would remain the same and the college would maintain its brainpower and research capacity. The plan calls for no lay-offs of tenure-track faculty." But what about that athletic budget? Surely UF could use that extra couple million out of the athletic association’s total $97 million to bolster engineering, right? Not exactly, says UF. The athletic association is a separate, nonprofit entity from the university and does not receive direct state funds. Its money comes from ticket sales, donations, Southeastern Conference revenues and student fees of about $2 per credit hour. UF President Bernie Machen has no authority over the association’s budget, said university spokeswoman Janine Sikes. "It is a separate organization with a separate board," she said. If the association wants to contribute to UF, that’s up to them. And it regularly does so, giving the university more than $60 million since 1991 for academics. Last year, it gave $6 million, paying for things like scholarships, campus events and updates to facilities. The association can’t give academics an unlimited amount, Sikes said. Not only does the program require money to operate, but many boosters are specific about wanting to donate to UF sports. After many commenters on the Forbes article made the same points, Salzberg added a clarification. But he maintains that the athletic association director reports to the university president, and as such, Machen should be able to direct those athletic funds however he wants. "He’s out of his mind to allow this to happen," Salzberg responded to a commenter. And if Machen isn’t doing anything about it, perhaps Gov. Rick Scott should, Salzberg said. After all, Salzberg points out, Scott just approved the creation of the state’s 12th university, Florida Polytechnic, which will be built in Lakeland under the flag of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. "Heads up, Gov. Scott: no one is going to believe that you’re supporting technical education when your flagship university is eliminating its Computer Science Department," Salzberg wrote. Scott’s office wasn’t crazy about that suggestion, also issuing a response to the Forbes piece. "It would be nice if Gov. Scott could make spending decisions for the universities, but that’s not the way our system is set up," said Lane Wright, a governor’s office spokesman. "In the meantime all he can do is what he has been doing, which is urging them to focus on programs that will give graduates hope of actually getting a job." Salzberg told Politifact Florida that the intent of his piece was to illustrate what he sees as hypocrisy by Scott and other state leaders — cutting the budget of a well-established engineering program while committing to a new university that’s likely to require more, not less, state resources in the future. It’s a compelling overall idea, but some of the finer points are a bit stretched. The university is considering consolidating programs, not eliminating computer science entirely. And the funds for academics and athletics aren’t easily moved around. We rule the statement Half True.	None	Forbes blog	None	None	None	2012-04-24T16:17:10	2012-04-22	['None']

pomt-12809	"This issue of busing voters in to New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics. It’s very real, it’s very serious."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/12/stephen-miller/white-house-senior-adviser-repeats-baseless-claim-/	President Donald Trump won the election but he lost New Hampshire, a fact he has tried to explain by arguing that liberal voters from Massachusetts crossed into New Hampshire to cast their vote against him. Trump floated the alleged Massachusetts-to-New Hampshire busing activity earlier in the week in a private meeting with 10 senators about Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, according to media reports. Trump and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is helping Gorsuch through the confirmation process, both lost their races in the Granite State to Democrats. ABC’s George Stephanopoulos repeatedly pressed Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller for evidence for Trump’s statement multiple times in a Feb. 12 interview on This Week. "I’ve actually, having worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters in to New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics. It’s very real, it’s very serious," Miller said. "This morning on this show is not the venue for me lay out all the evidence." Miller went on to talk about the administration’s issue with people who are registered to vote in two states or illegal voters on voter rolls, repeating false talking points and never bringing up evidence to back up the administration’s claim about a pipeline of bused-in voters in New Hampshire. (The White House did not provide evidence to back up the busing claim after Miller’s interview and instead pointed to a 2014 editorial about the need for voter ID laws that did not mention busing.) We searched widely, as have others, and failed to find any evidence corroborating Miller and Trump’s claim. Fergus Cullen, who ran the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2007-08, said the stories about voters coming over from Massachusetts are as old as "the invention of the bus." What fuels the concern is New Hampshire’s same-day voter registration law, even though it was adopted in the 1990s with strong Republican support to avoid the federal government’s "motor voter law," which allows people to register to vote at their DMV. "The result is that yes, it is possible and legal for someone to drive into a polling place in a car with out-of-state tags, register to vote, and vote," Cullen told PolitiFact. "Of course they have to sign affidavits and they would be risking significant legal penalties if they voted in more than one place or state. The odds of being caught are pretty high." He said the same theory was going around in New Hampshire in 2012, an election where Massachusetts Democrats were supporting Elizabeth Warren against incumbent Sen. Scott Brown. Adding more fuel to the talking point is that some Massachusetts residents do go to New Hampshire to help with that state’s closer elections, said Dante Scala, a University of New Hampshire political scientist who has written books and articles about the state’s elections over 15 years. "So it certainly is possible on election day people from Massachusetts come north to work on the election itself," he said, "but that’s a far cry from proving that they vote here." Miller’s claim has been analyzed by our colleagues at PolitiFact New Hampshire, who found no evidence busing exists. They rated a similar claim about Massachusetts residents boarding buses to vote in New Hampshire Pants on Fire. Chris Sununu, who won his bid for New Hampshire governor Nov. 8, warned ahead of the election that Democrats would bus in Massachusetts voters in places where elections are not close and assign them a fake address to apply for same-day voter registration in New Hampshire. That statement, like Miller’s, was flawed. Aside from one to two cases per election, the top state elections official said widespread voter fraud is not a problem. "I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it," New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner said in an interview with PolitiFact New Hampshire. New Hampshire law requires voters to provide IDs at the polls. Without a proper ID there are added barriers and questions, as the voters sign a sworn affidavit with their address and get their photo taken. After the election, the state sends confirmation letters to those addresses to confirm identities. Letters that are returned as undeliverable are investigated. In Sununu’s case, he eventually walked back much of his argument, saying he wasn’t talking about literal buses of voters crossing into the state; rather it was a "figure of speech that people are coming over, they’re temporarily here, they vote and then they leave." The incident he had in mind was, he said, of Portsmouth state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark letting Democratic staffers live at her house during the 2008 and 2012 elections. The staffers voted in New Hampshire, using her address — but that wasn’t illegal, the state attorney general concluded, because they had lived in the state for at least three months before the election. After Trump’s November victory, he continued to make claims of "serious voter fraud" in New Hampshire, Virginia or California. The claims rated Pants on Fire, Pants on Fire, and Pants on Fire. PolitiFact New Hampshire, in particular, talked to several state and local officials about whether anything fishy occurred Nov. 8. Nashua City Clerk Tricia Piecuch, who works in the state’s second-largest city on the border with Massachusetts, said nothing out of the ordinary went down. Officials in the Secretary of State’s office, Attorney General’s office and U.S. Attorney’s office all reported no complaints of voter fraud in the 2016 election. "We have never gotten any proof about buses showing up at polling places," Gardner, a Democrat, told The Boston Globe. "It’s not in a private place. It’s a public place." In response to reports about Trump’s meeting with senators, FEC Commissioner Ellen L. Weintraub called on the president to "immediately share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thorougly." "The president has issued an extraordinarily serious and specific charge," Weintraub wrote Feb. 10. "Allegations of this magnitude cannot be ignored." Our ruling A top adviser to Trump said people were bused into New Hampshire as part of an elaborate voting fraud scheme. However, there is no evidence this occurs, and Republicans and Democrats in New Hampshire say it does not. Trump and his White House have been asked multiple times to provide evidence but have not.

pomt-00952	"ISIS lures women with kittens, nutella."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/19/cnn/truth-about-isis-using-nutella-kittens-and-emoji-l/	Find a goofy still frame of television, and people will propel it across the Internet. CNN got a taste of this law of social media on Wednesday after airing a silly-looking graphic about a serious topic: the Islamic State’s recruitment of female fighters. The anchor’s set-up of the segment did little to help viewers take it seriously. "ISIS is talking online about jars of Nutella, pictures of kittens and emojis," CNN Newsroom host Carol Costello said in the Feb. 18, 2015, segment. "These three images are in part helping ISIS recruiters lure westerners into their fight because they want people to believe their life on the battlefield isn't so different than yours. They actually eat Nutella, and I guess they have pet kittens." As she spoke, a highly sharable graphic depicting a jar of the chocolate hazelnut spread, two orange tabby kittens and a silly face from the emoji keyboard appeared with script (a chyron in TV talk) that said "ISIS LURES WOMEN WITH KITTENS, NUTELLA". Costello went on to interview Nimmi Gowrinathan, an academic who studies women in crisis and a visiting professor at the Colin Powell Center for Civic and Global Leadership at City College, New York. The words "Nutella," "kittens" or "emoji" were not part of their discussion. Instead Gowrinathan talked about how the discussion of female Islamic State fighters (also called ISIS or ISIL) should focus on the larger political suppression that pushes women to join these kind of movements rather than looking at what may have triggered one woman’s turning point to extremism. But her more nuanced discussion wasn’t the takeaway. Instead the blogosphere ranks of Jezebel, New York Magazine’s Daily Intel, and, most angrily, Vox dinged CNN for suggesting women could be easily "lured" into ISIS with guilty, silly pleasures. As fact-checkers, we felt beckoned to sort out the confusion. Was CNN’s segment just plain weird or onto something? CNN did not return emails and calls for comment. We went to experts who track jihadist groups, including ISIS, on social media. "The way that the CNN story was framed was kind of funny and eyeroll-inducing," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, "but it’s largely correct." The online prowess of the Islamic State is a well-documented strength of the movement. From videos to online forums to journals to various social media websites, supporters disseminate propaganda messages (90,000 a day) that are more slickly produced and reach wider audiences than efforts from other terrorist groups (think of al-Qaida home videos showing Osama bin Laden speaking into the camera with little other detail). ISIS even has plans for a 24-hour propaganda network, said Daniel Cohen, a research fellow and coordinator of the cyber security program at Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies. The videos or posts are often translated into multiple languages so that demographic groups can be more effectively targeted around the world. Some of the imagery depicts a fulfilling life in a dream state ruled by sharia law, where kids are cheerful and ISIS recruits offer humanitarian aid in war zones. And yes, the group’s supporters also speak in emojis, tweet pictures of themselves unwinding with Nutella and run Twitter accounts like @ISILCats showing jihadists cuddling with kittens and kittens cuddling with firearms. It’s all part of an effort to speak the same cultural language as potential recruits so that they don’t think life with the Islamic State is all beheadings and burnings, Cohen said. "Most of the people sharing this content on social media came from Western culture," Cohen said. It makes them seem relatable and charismatic, said Gartenstein-Ross, adding that it’s nothing new for ISIS. Richard Brennan, a Middle East expert at the RAND Institute, said the ISIS campaign "is much more sophisticated" than what was portrayed on CNN. "It’s targeting the young men and women who want to be part of something greater than themselves to accept this movement for the validity that they believe the Koran is teaching," he said. Obviously, not all of the tweets, videos and images are cheery (the beheadings of prisoners, for instance). Other viral memes are designed to show how "disgusting" their enemies are by showing dead children’s bodies from bombs or airstrikes. The point is, the use of familiar western imagery in social media messages is just one tool in the Islamic State’s vast marketing toolbox, and the real motivations for someone joining the fight run much deeper. Those motivations are connected to the pursuit of identity and purpose. Some of the women recruited by ISIS act as internal police within their territories to make sure people are adhering to sharia law and stopping women who are not dressed appropriately, Cohen said. They also play a big role in online recruitment efforts. In an August article for Foreign Affairs, Gowrinathan criticized experts for being so perplexed by the formation of all-women brigades within ISIS. Women in war zones, she wrote, typically don’t have a role in the politics of their society and are drawn to extremism when they cannot air their grievances in the open. Still, some are coerced into joining and do so for their own safety. The audience for the communications with kittens and Nutella is a slim component of the majority of Sunni Islamic women who are joining ISIS from countries around the region out of oppression in their home state, she said in an interview with PunditFact. And even for the westerners, a life promising time with cute kitties and tasty sweets "won’t ever be enough of an effective recruitment tool for any group." "The kittens and emoticon thing is most damaging because it denies women any political agency," she said. "It infantilizes them in a way that you would assume they would be drawn to this for the most superficial reasons." For the record, Gowrinathan said she wasn’t brought on CNN to talk nutella and cats, nor was she pleased with the attention CNN producers brought to the popular hazelnut spread, winky faces and baby cats. "All I tried to point out is we dismiss women’s politics all the time," Gowrinathan said. Costello eventually deleted a tweet (which we captured below) promoting the segment with a video of the interview. And Gowrinathan tweeted that she did not, for the record, believe "emoticons are relevant in recruitment of #women to #isis." Our ruling This fact-check is a case study of what can go wrong when a news channel sacrifices nuance for an eye-catching graphic. On CNN, that graphic said, "ISIS LURES WOMEN WITH KITTENS, NUTELLA." There wasn’t much more to Costello’s introduction of the segment, but she did reference images of nutella, kittens and emojis that are used "in part" to recruit westerners. Costello’s words are technically accurate, but CNN’s click-baity graphic is incomplete and misleading. In reality, ISIS is using a vast array of tactics to persuade people to give up their lives for their fight. No expert would say that someone would join ISIS for the reasons isolated on CNN. To boil down ISIS’ recruitment strategy of women to nutella, emojis and kittens is a vast oversimplification that borders on the absurd. There is a shred of truth to this claim but not much beyond that. We rate it Mostly False.	None	CNN	None	None	None	2015-02-19T18:02:31	2015-02-18	['None']
pomt-00169	"The standard of voting in North Dakota is the easiest in the country."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/23/kevin-cramer/no-registration-voting-easiest-north-dakota/	In the first North Dakota Senate debate, incumbent Heidi Heitkamp and Republican challenger and U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer sparred over the fairness of who will get to participate in one of the most hotly contested elections. The moderator asked the two candidates whether they believe the Supreme Court made the right decision in upholding North Dakota’s new voter ID law on Oct. 9. The law requires residents show ID with a current street address. A federal district court in North Dakota originally ruled to allow voters to show either a current street or mailing address, like a PO box. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th circuit put that order on hold. The Supreme Court allowed the hold to stay in place. The case continues before the 8th Circuit. Heitkamp called attention to the law’s disproportionately negative effect on Native American voters, many of whom don’t have a street address and use a PO box instead. "Our district court judge did the right thing and ruled that this was an inappropriate infringement on voting rights," Heitkamp said. "I hope Native American veterans get an opportunity to vote because they put on a uniform and earned that opportunity." "And they do get to vote, Senator," Cramer replied. "That’s the point. The standard for voting in North Dakota is the easiest of anywhere in the country. We are the only state that does not have voter registration." Cramer is right that there’s no voter registration, unlike any other state. But that doesn’t make North Dakota the easiest state to vote in. "North Dakota does pretty well and did pretty well from 1996 to 2008," said Michael Pomante, a political science professor at Jacksonville University. "After 2008, that’s no longer the case." Pomante published a paper in September that ranks the 50 states according to the ease of 33 voting laws alongside two other researchers. They looked at registration requirements, wait times, mail-in ballot options and the strictness of voter ID laws, among other indicators. North Dakota used to be No. 1 because of its lack of voter registration. It ranked fourth in 2016, and Pomante expects it to drop several spots next year because of the new ID law Heitkamp mentioned. He expects other states to jump ahead thanks to automatic registration options when people are in contact with a state agency. In 2016, the researchers determined that voting was easiest in Oregon, where voters are registered automatically and are mailed ballots weeks in advance of election day. Colorado and California came in at second and third, respectively. "Registering to vote is the biggest determinant of whether or not someone can vote," Pomante said. "So having no registration means you can just show up, and automatic means same thing. Basically the burden of registering to vote is no longer on the individual citizen." Essentially, having no registration doesn’t make North Dakota all that special anymore. Cameron Wimpy, a political scientist working at the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, said comparison between states with automatic and no registration is difficult because there is little data. The difference, then, comes down to the strictness of laws determining what forms of ID people can show at the polls. "There is a reality that registration can cause issues. But in the places that registration is easy, it’s hard to believe registration is more difficult than the situation where you have to bring several documents from a limited list," Wimpy said. (North Dakota also ranked fourth in the MIT Elections Performance Index in 2016. That ranking did not take voter ID laws into account last year.) Voter ID law have made voting harder in North Dakota The National Conference of State Legislatures breaks down voter ID laws into categories of strict and non-strict, without a ranking. In 2018, North Dakota fell under the strict side of the dividing line. Non-strict states allow at least some voters without an acceptable ID to cast a ballot and have it count. Strict states, like North Dakota this year, require those voters to cast a provisional ballot. In order for their vote to count, they must also take additional steps after election day. Up until 2013, North Dakota citizens could go to the polls and show a single non-photo ID. If they failed to provide such documentation, a poll worker could vouch for the voter’s identity. North Dakota’s sparsely populated rural precincts easily lent themselves to this method. Otherwise, the voter could sign an affidavit at the polling station. That changed when the North Dakota legislative assembly passed a law getting rid of these two fail-safes. The law also limited the forms of acceptable identification. A 2015 law further limited those forms of ID. Seven Native American voters challenged the law in 2016. They argued the statute disproportionately affects Native Americans. The law requires an ID with a valid street address, which many rural tribal members don’t have. According to the plaintiffs, 70,000 North Dakota residents lack a qualifying ID and 18,000 lack supplemental documentation. The lawsuit began a two-year legal battle that is still ongoing. A federal judge issued a temporary order in 2016 that the affidavit remain an option, so North Dakota remained a non-strict state that year. But the strict ID law will be in place this election cycle after the Supreme Court decided not to intervene in October. Tribal officials and Four Directions, a voting rights advocacy group, are working with the Secretary of State’s office to secure acceptable forms of ID for tribal members with only PO boxes. Our ruling Cramer said, "The standard of voting in North Dakota is the easiest in the country." North Dakota ranked near, but never at the top, of any voting ease lists in 2016. The state’s ease of voting is already falling by some metrics ahead of Election Day 2018 with a stricter voting ID law in place, despite North Dakota being the only state without voter registration.

pomt-13561	Says Arizona congressional candidate Christine Jones "called Hillary Clinton ‘a capable and respected leader,’ and an ‘effective’ secretary of state. ... Hillary Clinton effective? Christine Jones thinks so."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/aug/24/club-growth/conservative-group-attacks-arizona-gop-candidate-c/	Conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth is weighing in on the crowded GOP race for Arizona’s Fifth Congressional District ahead of Tuesday's primary. Former GoDaddy executive Christine Jones of Phoenix, state Senate Majority Leader Andy Biggs of Gilbert, state Rep. Justin Olson of Mesa, and former Maricopa County Supervisor Don Stapley of Mesa all seek the strong Republican seat. The Club for Growth television ad, which started running Aug. 4, takes aim at Jones, attempting to make her synonymous with Hillary Clinton. "Jones called Hillary Clinton ‘a capable and respected leader,’ and an ‘effective’ secretary of state," the ad states. "Hillary Clinton effective? Christine Jones thinks so." Club for Growth, which endorsed Biggs, has spent more than $340,000 against Jones, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. We wanted to know whether Jones really talked about Clinton in the way Club for Growth described. The ad cites a couple of Jones’ personal blog posts, dating back to 2012. On her blog, Rudy Syndrome, Jones did reference Clinton in a Jan. 2, 2012, post with political predictions. She notes that the predictions are her "purely unscientific, objective opinion." Here’s how the Clinton prediction reads: Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, will continue to stand out as a capable and respected leader and a commanding presence in US international relations, causing even more Democrats to wonder why she wasn’t their candidate in 2008, and calling for her to replace vice president Biden as president Obama’s running mate in the 2012 general election, or better yet, to challenge the president in a Democratic primary. In a year-end recap on Dec. 30, 2012, Jones notes that her prediction was true. "She has made her boss and her party look good with her tireless efforts to represent the U.S. abroad for the past four years. She will be a formidable force in the coming years," Jones wrote. In her 2013 prediction post, Jones also calls Clinton an "effective Secretary of State." Americans, regardless of party-affiliation or political involvement, will begin to realize what an effective Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was, as her replacement begins to be scrutinized for failing to live up to the incredibly high standard she set. During her unsuccessful run for governor, Jones started to change her message about Clinton and her predictions. In a January 2014 post recapping the results of her 2013 predictions, Jones said her prediction about Clinton did not amount to an endorsement. "Nothing could be further from the truth," Jones said. "My politics and hers could not be more different: she is a big government, tax and spend liberal; I am a committed conservative, dedicated to fiercely defending the constitution and the principles upon which this country was founded." While Jones did once have supportive words for Clinton, that does not reflect her present-day tone -- as the ad attempts to show. We did not hear back from Club for Growth, but Jones spokesman Brian Seitchik reiterated Jones' disdain for Clinton. "Christine Jones opposes Hillary Clinton and will do everything possible to defeat her," Seitchik said. Our ruling Club for Growth said, "Jones called Hillary Clinton ‘a capable and respected leader,’ and an ‘effective’ secretary of state ... Hillary Clinton effective? Christine Jones thinks so." In multiple blog posts dating back to January 2012, Jones does characterize Clinton as capable, respected and effective. What the ad does not mention is how Jones started walking back her remarks in 2014. By saying "Christine Jones thinks so," in present tense, Club for Growth neglects to account for her more recent perspective. We rate the ad’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4d0db0ff-0969-4d23-a563-8e7f8c29096c	None	Club for Growth	None	None	None	2016-08-24T16:07:56	2016-08-04	['Hillary_Rodham_Clinton', 'Arizona']
pomt-07623	The Texas Constitution "still contains Jim Crow provisions about the poll tax and restrictions on women having the right to vote."	false	/texas/statements/2011/mar/19/charles-reed/waco-activist-says-texas-constitution-still-contai/	An oped article published in the Austin American-Statesman March 11 says the much-amended Texas Constitution, adopted in 1876, is ripe for a modernizing overhaul. Charles Reed of Waco writes: "In the 135 years since its ratification, the constitution of 1876 has been amended 467 times in a haphazard fashion. The result is a constitution that is chaotic, incoherent, lengthy, unwieldy and full of dead wood." An effort joined by Reed to draft an overhaul is touted at http://reorgcon2011.com/. Among the rotten timbers still in the constitution, the article says: "Jim Crow provisions about the poll tax and restrictions on women having the right to vote." That tax and male-only voting are long-gone practices. So this claim piqued our curiousity. Reed, a retired federal employee who was once Waco’s mayor, initially told us that what while such language remains in the infamously unwieldy constitution, "it’s, of course, not operable language." He referred us to Article VI, titled "Suffrage." When we looked at the latest version of the constitution posted online by the Texas Legislative Council, we found that the article opens with language that bars from voting people who are under 18 or who have been found mentally incompetent by a court or convicted of a felony. The article makes no specific references to the poll tax or to women voting. Realizing the tax was prevalent for decades and that U.S. women were not permitted to vote until the 20th century, we turned next to the Handbook of Texas, published by the Texas State Historical Society. Its entry titled "Woman Suffrage" says Texas women gained the right to vote in party primaries in 1918 through a measure approved by legislators and signed into law by Gov. William Hobby. Some 386,000 women women registered to vote in that year’s Democratic primary, the entry says. But attempts to give women the vote in all elections were thwarted, the entry says, even after lawmakers in 1919 heeded Hobby’s counsel to send voters a proposed constitutional amendment extending full suffrage to women. Hobby also sought a proposed amendment to take the vote from persons of foreign birth who hadn’t also attained U.S. citizenship through naturalization--and when the two proposed changes were rolled into a single amendment, it lost at the polls. A month later, according to the entry, the proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution to permit women to vote was submitted to the states. Texas legislators ratified what soon became the federal document’s 19th Amendment, stating that the right to vote shall not be abridged or denied by any state on account of sex. What about the poll tax, the fee that had to be paid at the polls and helped deter low-income and minority citizens from voting for a long time? The handbook’s entry on the state’s election laws says the 1964 elections were the first "in which no poll tax was required to vote in federal elections" due to the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The amendment abolished the poll tax as a voting requirement for president, vice president, presidential electors, U.S. senators and representatives. In Texas, though, the tax survived for state and local elections until voters in 1966 approved an amendment removing it from the constitution. Reed suggested we check his statement with David Guinn, a Baylor University law professor. Guinn nudged us to Austin lawyer Bob Heath, who once helped the Texas attorney general draft advisory opinions about legal issues. In an interview, Heath said he doesn’t think Reed’s statement is correct. Like us, he did not find references to women not voting and the poll tax in the current constitution. In a follow-up conversation, Reed said, "I recognize I was wrong in saying that. I was going based on my memory" in the op-ed article. However, he said his main point holds: The constitution has a lot of "inoperable language" that needs to be pruned, such as outdated references to bonds for special districts that have been paid off. "I made a mistake in using the wrong example," Reed said. We rate his statement False.	None	Charles Reed	None	None	None	2011-03-19T06:00:00	2011-03-11	['Jim_Crow_laws']

pomt-03271	"Half of all adults have a pre-existing condition" that could affect their health care coverage.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/07/jan-schakowsky/schakowsky-says-half-all-adults-have-pre-existing-/	One of the more popular provisions in the Affordable Care Act is the one that prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to people who already have health problems. Pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, depression and diabetes are among the most common ailments that can get in the way of being accepted by a new insurance company. The health care law tackled this problem in two steps. Starting with children, as of September 2010, insurers could not deny coverage, charge significantly higher premiums, require an extended waiting period or curtail benefits due to a pre-existing condition. The second step takes place Jan. 1, 2014, when the same protections kick in for adults. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., appearing Aug. 5, 2013, on PoliticsNation on MSNBC, chastised Republicans for wanting to repeal Obamacare, saying many benefits would be lost. "Half of all adults have a pre-existing condition that will go away in terms of insurance coverage on January 1st," Schakowsky said. "I mean, what a blessing that is for sick Americans, for people who are walking around uninsured or underinsured." We know that Americans face a lot of health challenges, but do half of adults have a pre-existing condition? In the eye of the insurer There are a range of estimates for the number of people with health issues that would put them at risk of running afoul of an insurance company. One reason is that insurers have different lists of conditions that raise a red flag. Similarly, researchers can take a conservative approach and use a short list, or be more expansive with a longer one. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, examined five studies on the prevalence of pre-existing conditions. The lowest estimate counted just eight diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. That study came up with about 36 million people between 19 and 64 who have one of those health issues. Another study used a list of 60 conditions and arrived at a number of 60 million who might be vulnerable to denial of coverage, and the GAO itself used medical survey data and reached a high-end estimate of 122 million. As percentages, this translates into a low-end estimate of 20 percent of American adults potentially at risk, 66 percent on the high end, with a midpoint of 32 percent. An analysis from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services came up with a roughly similar range of 19 percent to 50 percent. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, notes that projections of the scope of the problem can miss the mark. The administration expected about 375,000 people would enroll in a special insurance program for those who had been denied coverage but as of January 2013, only about 107,000 had. That said, many factors apart from health could have affected enrollments. The main caveat with these studies is they estimate the number of people who have a health issue that might lead to denial of coverage by an insurance company. That describes a group of people who are at risk. What’s missing is an estimate of the number of people who actually run into the problem of being denied coverage. A limited analysis emerged from the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2009. Using data from four of the country’s largest private insurers, committee investigators found that the companies had denied coverage to one out of seven people based on pre-existing conditions during a three-year period. The denial rate rose each year, increasing by nearly 50 percent over the three years while at the same time, the number of new applications for coverage only rose by about 16 percent. Survey says Another line of data comes from the Kaiser Family Foundation and its monthly tracking polls. In June 2013, Kaiser reported that 49 percent of adults said that they or a family member has heart disease, diabetes, cancer or another condition that generally triggers an issue with insurance companies. Within that group, about a fourth of them reported that coverage had been denied or higher premiums had been charged due to a pre-existing condition. This is far from a perfect fit with the other studies. To say someone in your family has a health condition is essentially reporting at the household level, while the GAO and other studies were estimating the number of individuals. And if we do the math, it seems like about an eighth, or 12 percent of the households had actually run into a problem with a health insurance company. The Kaiser survey does affirm that the problem is substantive and relatively widespread, although not necessarily as broad as the higher estimates in the studies. Our ruling Schakowsky said that half of all adults suffer from a pre-existing condition. Studies reflect a range of estimates and Schakowsky’s figure falls at the high end. A government analysis points to a mid-range estimate of 32 percent, a significant fraction of the adult population. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-13701	After the shootings of Dallas policemen, "nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/28/hillary-clinton/clinton-deaths-dallas-police-drew-nearly-500-job-a/	As she accepted the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton hammered her campaign’s central theme that the country moves forward when people work together. Clinton found inspiration from the response that came after five police officers were shot dead in Dallas. "Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them," Clinton said. "And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days." Clinton has it right. On July 7 in Dallas, as a peaceful protest wrapped up in the evening, an Army veteran systematically opened fire on white police officers. By the time he was cornered and killed, five officers were dead. Four days later, the Dallas police chief held a press conference where he urged the public to understand the pressures facing his officers. And he addressed the protestors in the Black Lives Matter movement. "We’re hiring," Brown said. "Get off that protest line and put an application in." The plea seems to have worked. On July 22,the Dallas Police Department posted the application numbers on its Facebook page. In the 12 days between July 8 and July 20, 467 people applied to work for the department. There’s been no further update on the department’s Facebook page. Our ruling Clinton said nearly 500 people applied to the Dallas Police Department in 12 days. The Dallas police said 467 people applied between July 8 and July 20. That’s reasonably close to 500.

pomt-10114	"98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000" and would not see a tax increase under Barack Obama's plan.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/16/barack-obama/most-small-businesses-wont-be-subject-to-obamas-ta/	During the final presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y., Barack Obama and John McCain got into an argument about Joe the Plumber. McCain said Joe would get a bigger tax bill under the Obama tax plan. Obama defended himself by saying that "98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000" and would not see a tax increase under the Obama plan. Joe the Plumber is an actual person: Joe Wurzelbacher, who met Obama during a campaign stop a few days before the debate in Toledo, Ohio. "I'm getting ready to buy a company that makes about $250,000, $270,000, $280,000 a year," he told Obama. "Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?" Obama said yes, it would --see their entire conversation on YouTube -- but Obama defended his tax policy as being good for people who are struggling. "It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too," Obama said. During the debate, John McCain mentioned Joe the Plumber at least a dozen times as the kind of small business owner who would pay more taxes under Obama's plans. It's not clear from the exchange just what Joe means when he says the business "makes" up to $280,000 a year. Is he talking about total revenue? Profits? That's an important point here and it's one that Obama and Joe the Plumber never discussed. Based on Obama's proposals and current tax policy, for Joe's taxes to rise Joe would have to "make" $250,000 in net profit, after deducting all his expenses: his employees' pay, his supplies, his truck, his fuel costs, and other legitimate business expenses. He'd have to be an extremely successful plumber. In response to McCain's statements during the debate, Obama said only 2 percent of small businesses would be subject to the tax. It seems likely that Obama is right, according to data and an analysis from the experts at the Tax Policy Center. Obama's plan is to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the top two tax brackets. In practice, this means that people with income above $200,000 for single people and $250,000 for couples would see taxes increase. Now what does this mean for small businesses? It's not as easy as you might think to identify small businesses via the tax code. But there are several typical ways that small business owners pay their taxes, usually by declaring business income on their individual tax returns. Many people who declare business income are small businesses, though the group also includes professionals like lawyers, authors, or public speakers. Looking at all the tax filers who report any business income at all, the Tax Policy Center confirms that about 2 percent will see their taxes increase under Obama's plan. In an effort to focus more effectively on small business owners, the Tax Policy Center did an additional analysis where they looked at people who reported business income that accounted for at least 50 percent of their income. This means people who derive a significant living off their business income. In 2007, about 2 percent of those tax filers would have made enough money to see a tax increase under Obama's plans. There is a small bit of uncertainty in the best data available; it includes some people who we would not think of as traditional small business owners. But still, Obama's statement during the debate that "98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000" matches the findings of a respected, non-partisan group of tax analysts. For that reason, we rate Obama's statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-16T00:00:00	2008-10-15	['None']
pomt-05337	"Tom Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/may/14/conservative-renewal-pac/pro-dewhurst-political-group-says-tom-leppert-pled/	A TV ad aired by a political action committee favoring David Dewhurst for the U.S. Senate includes this claim about a former Dallas mayor likewise seeking the Republican Senate nomination: "Tom Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants." He did? Broadly, the idea of sanctuaries for immigrants gained currency in some quarters in the 1980s as citizens of strife-torn countries in Central America sought refuge in the United States. Of late, in contrast, the "sanctuary city" label has been bandied to refer to communities that do not routinely identify and detain illegal immigrants. For instance, a Sept. 19, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news story about Gov. Rick Perry’s unsuccessful calls on Texas lawmakers to ban sanctuary cities said a "sanctuary city prohibits law enforcement from asking about the immigration status of the people they detain." In 2010, Perry and other foes of Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, formerly Houston’s mayor, said he had offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants in the Bayou City. They pointed to a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service listing Houston among 32 localities that had sanctuary policies. We rated Perry’s claim False. Houston police did not ask people what their immigration status is during routine patrols, but the only immigration-related action by White that we found relevant was intended to make it harder, not easier, for illegal immigrants to remain. On White’s watch, Houston joined the federal Secure Communities program under which fingerprints of people detained by local law enforcement agencies are checked against those of criminal illegal immigrants kept by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And how did the Conservative Renewal PAC conclude that Leppert pledged to make Dallas a sanctuary city? In an April 27, 2012, letter defending its ad, two lawyers for the PAC said Leppert, who was mayor from mid-2007 into February 2011, signed an ACORN pledge while running for mayor that was tantamount to promising to make the city a sanctuary. ACORN, since folded, was a left-leaning voter registration and advocacy group. According to the lawyers’ letter, the Leppert-signed pledge said: "If elected, I will respect the fact that immigration policy is a federal issue and does not fall under the city's domain." The lawyers’ letter offers as analysis: "This is a pledge to refrain from undertaking to enforce immigration laws in Dallas. ... This is indisputably a pledge to uphold Dallas’s status as a ‘sanctuary city.’" We failed to land a readable copy of the original pledge either from the PAC, which did not provide one, or Leppert. (An online video posted by a Dallas Morning News reporter in May 2011 appears to show Leppert attending an ACORN gathering; an immigration-related pledge, displayed on the wall, twice appears, partly viewable, in the background.) Leppert’s campaign spokesman, Daniel Keylin, confirmed by telephone that Leppert signed a pledge stating that immigration law enforcement is a federal duty. However, he said, he's not 100 percent certain that it had the language cited in the TV ad. Separately, our online search for news articles on any Leppert "sanctuary" pledge came up empty, although a July 8, 2007, editorial in the Dallas Morning News said Leppert had pledged to create a city office of immigrant affairs. Asked for elaboration, Keylin noted a July 3, 2007, Morning News news article (likely the basis of the editorial) indicating that Leppert supported such an office, which activists were pushing. "All I want is to make sure we have a clear direction," the article quotes Leppert as saying. "Who does it serve and how are we going to measure its success?" According to the article, the advocates envisioned it helping legal and illegal immigrants assimilate. Keylin told us via email that one reason the office did not come to be is that Leppert did not want it to serve illegal immigrants. Keylin reminded us, too, that most individuals arrested in Dallas are processed at the county jail where fingerprints are shared through the Secure Communities program, which the county joined while Leppert was mayor. During Leppert’s time as mayor, Keylin said, the Dallas City Council did not take up or pass an ordinance to help out illegal immigrants. Keylin noted, too, a Jan. 14, 2011, American-Statesman news article indicating that in Austin, Travis County and Houston, local policies barred law enforcement officers from stopping people to determine their immigration status or because they thought someone was in the country illegally. Keylin insisted that is not the case in the City of Dallas, though the January 2011 Statesman story says that police and sheriff's officials in Austin, Dallas and Houston said they don't enforce immigration laws or ask people about their immigration status, in part to encourage people to report crimes and work with police. The story says Dallas County sheriff and Houston police policies note the role undocumented immigrants play in law enforcement. According to the story, Dallas County’s policy, put in place in 2010, says: "Participation and involvement of the undocumented aliens' community in law enforcement activities will increase the Sheriff's Department's ability to protect and serve the entire community." The Statesman story, quoting a Dallas County sheriff’s detective, says that when an individual is booked into jail after being arrested, an officer fills out a booking sheet that asks place of birth. Those born outside the U.S. may be questioned further by a federal immigration officer stationed at the booking site, the detective, Raul Reyna, is quoted as saying. We turned next to federal and municipal authorities. By email, ICE spokeswoman Leticia Zamarripa confirmed that the Secure Communities program was activated in Dallas and Dallas County in November 2008, which was more than a year into Leppert’s time as mayor. Broadly, Tom Perkins, city attorney for the City of Dallas, told us in a telephone interview: "There is no ordinance or City Council resolution that designates Dallas as a sanctuary city and there is no Dallas City Council ordinance or regulation that prohibits Dallas police officers from inquiring into (the) immigration status" of individuals stopped for questioning. He also mentioned the Dallas Police Department’s instruction to police officers, titled "Illegal Immigrants." Melinda Gutierrez, a spokeswoman for the Dallas Police Department, later sent us the latest version of General Order 315.04, which was revised Feb. 17, 2011, about a week before Leppert resigned as mayor. The order, similar to a September 2008 version we found in a report by the Washington-based Police Foundation, opens: "The U.S. Immigration Code denies us the authority to enforce its provisions; therefore, we do not enforce immigration laws. All other laws apply to illegal immigrants." The order continues: "Officers will not stop or contact citizens for the sole purpose of determining immigration status." Gutierrez, asked if this means officers ask into the immigration status of individuals in other instances, told us by telephone: "It’s not something we generally do." Also from the order: "Arrest reports will contain arrest elements only and not refer to immigration status." Federal immigration "agents have the sole responsibility for determining the immigration status of incarcerated persons," the order says, and federal agents assigned to the Lew Sterrett Justice Center, where suspects are detained, "review arrest reports submitted to the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office, and then decide which inmates to investigate for possible immigration violations." Also, the order says, if immigration authorities advise that someone should be detained for an immigration violation, the person will be held by the police. Finally, the order says, city charges will be dropped on request of the immigration agency. Gutierrez, asked how long the policy of not stopping individuals solely to check on their immigration status had been in place, sent us a May 1996 special order to department employees from Bennie R. Click, then the police chief. The memo said the department was revising procedures for handling criminal suspects who may also be illegal immigrants to eliminate duplication of the efforts of federal immigration officials and to clarify that Dallas officers not "make investigative stops for the sole purpose of determining citizenship, nor make arrests for immigration law violations." The full revised order regarding illegal immigrants, shown in the memo, is similar to the 2008 and 2011 versions. So, for more than 15 years, the Dallas Police Department has had a policy advising police officers against inquiring into the immigration status of individuals, though it also says federal officials routinely review local arrest reports and decide which inmates to investigate for immigration violations. in a telephone interview, Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, which supports police departments staying out of immigration law enforcement, said "sanctuary city" can be considered a "glittering generality," implying a place where people illegally in the United States can go and nothing will happen to them. Still, he said, local police will arrest any individuals who break state or local laws. "If you go to Dallas and you violate their laws, they’re going to lock you up," he said. Our ruling We were hampered by not being offered, or finding, the original described pledge. Still, Leppert''s camp confirmed that he at one time pledged respect for immigration enforcement being a federal issue. If so, our sense is that he acted in step with the police department’s decade-old policy of leaving immigration-related inquiries to Uncle Sam -- which alone can be taken as sufficient to support the "sanctuary city" label. Then again, Leppert did not pledge to "make" Dallas into a sanctuary. His position was essentially status quo. Also, the county joined the Secure Communities program while he was mayor. This claim ignores these critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Conservative Renewal PAC	None	None	None	2012-05-14T15:14:20	2012-04-27	['Dallas']

pomt-13585	"Gonzales’ losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2016/aug/17/michael-madigan/madigan-claim-gonzales-campaign-fund-mostly-false/	Is Jason Gonzales a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gov. Bruce Rauner and his associates as Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan claims? Madigan, who has served as speaker for all but two years since 1983, was challenged in the 2016 Democratic primary election for the 22nd District by Jason Gonzales, an entrepreneur and high school dropout who went on to receive degrees from Duke, MIT and Harvard. Despite labeling himself as a progressive, Gonzales had the backing of Republicans and supporters of Gov. Bruce Rauner. Nearly six months after being defeated in the primary by more than 38 percentage points, Gonzales filed a lawsuit on Aug. 8 accusing Madigan -- who also is chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party -- of dozens of illegal and fraudulent acts during the election season. The 39-count suit accuses Madigan and others of defaming Gonzales by calling him a convicted felon in campaign ads and committing fraud by putting up two "fake" candidates on the ballot to "dilute" the Latino vote, among other allegations. In response to the lawsuit, Madigan issued a statement calling Gonzales’ claims without merit, but one sentence in particular stood out: "Gonzales’ losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner." While it’s no secret Gonzales was backed by Republicans and supporters of Rauner -- Madigan’s biggest political foe -- is it true his campaign was funded with more than $1 million from them? Following the money Madigan spokesman Steve Brown told PolitiFact Illinois the $1 million figure came from the Illinois State Board of Elections. Campaign finance records from the State Board of Elections show Gonzales received $278,771 in individual contributions during the primary race. We found some of the top contributors to Gonzales’ campaign fund also have donated to Rauner and some top contributors to Gonzales also have donated to other Democrats. In a phone interview, Gonzales acknowledged he received financial support from the governor’s supporters, but said there never was a quid pro quo between him and Rauner or his allies. Gonzales pointed out many of his donors have contributed to both parties. And not all of his top contributors have donated to Rauner. Robert Hirsch, CEO of Gold Eagle, a company that manufactures automotive chemicals, donated $27,500 to Gonzales -- the largest individual contribution to the campaign -- but there is no record of Hirsch contributing to Rauner’s political committees. However, Hirsch did support redistricting reform efforts backed by Rauner and opposed by Madigan in 2014 and 2016, though that is an issue that has bipartisan support. "I had to dial for money every day, and a lot of donors I dialed on Democratic lists happened to be supporters of Bruce Rauner and there was nothing I could do about that," Gonzales said. Among Gonzales’ top donors was Blair Hull, a wealthy Chicago businessman who unsuccessfully ran in the 2004 Democratic primary race for U.S. Senate, which eventually was won by then-state Sen. Barack Obama. Records show Hull donated $7,250 to Gonzales’ campaign on March 3. He also contributed $5,000 to Rauner during the 2014 gubernatorial race. But Hull’s company, Hull Investments LLC, donated $450,000 to the Illinois United for Change super PAC, which spent $506,000 in support of Gonzales and $367,000 against Madigan. Calls to Hull Investments LLC were not returned, but Hull told the Capitol Fax blog in February that Madigan "is not a team player" and "does not cooperate well with others." Hull added that he believed "the state of Illinois and the Legislature would be improved significantly without Michael Madigan." If you combine the total amount spent in the race by Illinois United for Change and individual contributions to Gonzales’ campaign fund, it comes out to about $1.15 million. While Brown noted spending by the super PAC was included in Madigan’s claim, it’s illegal for an independent expenditure committee to contribute directly to a candidate’s campaign. Kent Redfield, an Illinois campaign finance expert and professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois-Springfield, said Madigan’s statement is a "reasonable assumption," but there’s no evidence to suggest the super PAC coordinated with Rauner’s office, his political committees or supporters. "The statement makes it sound like it was a coordinated campaign that involved different entities," Redfield said. "While it may be the case, you don’t have anything on public record." Redfield characterized Madigan’s claim as an "overstatement." He added that while it "assumes a connection that very well may be there," there’s no definitive link. However, the issue of dark money makes it extremely difficult to determine where exactly the money is coming from, notes Sarah Brune, executive director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. For example, Illinois United for Change received $20,000 in donations from the Illinois Opportunity Project, a 501(c)4 organization that is highly critical of Madigan and supportive of Rauner. The group is led by Dan Proft, Matthew Besler and Pat Hughes, all of whom are Republicans. Non-profit 501(c)4 groups can spend unlimited amounts of money on politics without disclosing their donors, making it impossible to identify direct ties to certain politicians or their supporters. Our ruling Madigan said, "Gonzales’ losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner." Indeed, Gonzales’ campaign received big donations from people who also gave to Rauner’s campaign fund, but the speaker implies that every donation came from individuals and groups aligned with the governor. In fact, a few of Gonzales’ top donors have also contributed to Democrats and one of his top five donors contributed to Gonzales and no one else. Further, Madigan’s "more than $1 million" includes spending by the Illinois United for Change super PAC, despite the fact that super PAC money cannot be given directly to a candidate’s campaign nor can it be coordinated with a candidate’s campaign. We rate Madigan’s claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a1d2957-50ad-4415-a9b1-895f7e25d265	None	Michael Madigan	None	None	None	2016-08-17T20:03:21	2016-08-08	['None']
pomt-13449	"The head of the IRS ordered 24,000 emails erased before Congress could review them, making sure the American people will never know the real truth."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/15/john-fleming/john-fleming-attacks-irs-inaccurate-radio-ad/	In a recent radio campaign ad, Louisiana senate candidate John Fleming claimed that the head of the Internal Revenue Service ordered 24,000 emails erased before Congress could see them. "The head of the IRS ordered 24,000 emails erased before Congress could review them, making sure the American people will never know the real truth," Fleming’s ad says. "The officials in charge follow the same dishonest playbook they’ve used for every scandal from Fast and Furious to Hillary’s emails." Fleming is running for senator of Louisiana against six Republican candidates, including David Duke, as well as three Democrats and one unaffiliated candidate. Fleming -- who currently represents Louisiana in the House -- is calling for the impeachment of IRS commissioner John Koskinen. So far, Democrats are largely against the impeachment, and Republicans are divided on it, citing due process concerns. A vote on the matter was expected on Sept. 15, 2016, but it was delayed. Since destruction of documents is a serious charge, we wondered if it was true that the head of the IRS "ordered 24,000 emails erased before Congress could review them." Independent reports suggest that’s not the case. Congress first requested emails in May 2013 as part of an investigation into unfair targeting of the Tea Party and other right-leaning groups for tax exemptions. Lois Lerner – the former Exempt Organizations Unit director – had admitted to using loaded keywords, including "tea party," to search within tax exemption forms. However, it was not proven the IRS targeted groups based on political ideology. Investigators then noticed a gap in email dates. They discovered Lerner’s hard drive crashed in 2011, erasing Congress-requested emails. This prompted another investigation into whether the IRS purposefully destroyed the them. According to investigation reports from the Justice Department and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, no evidence was found that the IRS intentionally obstructed justice. Both investigations reached the same conclusion after interviewing 118 witnesses, reviewing 20 terabytes of data (equal to about 1.3 million printed pages) and collecting documentation from more than 80 IRS employees. One method investigators used to try to recover documents was to examine IRS email backup tapes. They discovered IRS employees had inadvertently destroyed 400 tapes that may have contained the missing emails. In May 2013, then-IRS Chief Technology Officer, Terence Milholland, sent an email in changing the backup tape recycle policy from six months to an indefinite retention period. "Given the current environment and ongoing investigations, until further notice, do not destroy/wipe/reuse any of the existing backup tapes for email, or archiving of other information from IRS personal computers," the email said. Milholland also instructed employees to save all information on personal computers being returned, reclaimed, refreshed, or updated. However, there was a misunderstanding among employees, resulting in the destruction of the tapes. Treasury Department interviews and emails between employees show some thought the CTO policy only prevented the destruction of hard drives, the report investigation said. We reached out to the Fleming campaign, and they sent us a transcript of a hearing before the Committee on Government Oversight and Reform on the IRS emails. According to testimony from Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George during the hearing, "As Ms. Lerner’s hard drive could not be recovered, and the 422 tapes most likely to have contained Ms. Lerner’s e-mails from 2010 and 2011 were erased in March 2014, we were unable to recover all of the missing e-mails." However, the Treasury Inspector General investigation stated, "No evidence was uncovered that any IRS employees had been directed to destroy or hide information from Congress, the DOJ or TIGTA." Our ruling Fleming said, "The head of the IRS ordered 24,000 emails erased before Congress could review them, making sure the American people will never know the real truth." Emails were erased, and up to 24,000 are likely unrecoverable. However, there’s zero evidence that the head of the IRS ordered them destroyed. Multiple independent investigations confirmed that the erasure was accidental and not intended to obstruct information from Congress. Fleming’s ad says the opposite. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14285	"I have 2 and a half million more votes than he (Sanders) does."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/05/hillary-clinton/does-clinton-really-have-25-million-more-votes-san/	Momentum in politics might be hard to define, and it might be fleeting, but one thing is sure -- you don’t want the other guy to have it. So when on April 5, 2016, one of the hosts of ABC’s The View began a question to Hillary Clinton with the fact that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had won five out of the past six contests, Clinton made sure that didn’t hang in the air very long. "You have to look at the broader perspective," Clinton said. "He’s won some, and I’ve won some, but I have 2 and a half million more votes than he does. And I have a very significant lead in delegates." (Separately, Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook made the same claim in an April 4 Medium post titled, "To Hillary Clinton supporters: The facts on where the race stands.") Does Clinton have a 2.5 million-vote lead over Sanders? We asked both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns for their numbers. Sanders’ staff pointed us to a spreadsheet produced by Fair Vote, an advocacy group that supports new approaches to voting to reduce partisanship. The Clinton campaign also sent us their election vote tally. There’s really only one significant hitch in all of the data. For states that hold primaries, you can see how many votes were cast for Clinton and Sanders. That also true for some, but not all, caucus states. So for example, Colorado held a caucus and Sanders got 71,928 votes compared with Clinton’s 49,256. But for Iowa, Nevada and Maine, the only numbers that get reported are the delegates awarded to each candidate. The ratio of delegates to votes varies from precinct to precinct so there’s no way to do some simple math to get to the underlying number of votes. Sam Lau, communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, told us "I don’t know of any data on this." The situation is the same for Nevada and Maine. And a Washington Democratic Party staffer told us they would have the raw vote tallies eventually, but right now, they were still getting packets sent in from around the state and tabulating them. Where does that leave us? Well, with the Wisconsin vote not yet in, based on the Fair Vote totals, the primary tallies stand at 8,746,692 for Clinton compared to 6,049,960 for Sanders. This gives Clinton nearly 2.7 million votes more than her rival. But when we factor in the caucuses with full vote counts, Clinton’s margin drops to a bit over 2.5 million. (Those states are Utah, Nebraska, Minnesota, Kansas, Idaho, Hawaii, Colorado and Alaska.) Would the actual votes from the remaining caucuses in Iowa, Nevada, and Maine, as well as Washington, change the totals very much? No one can say for sure, because literally, no one has the numbers. One can run some rough estimates by taking the estimated Democratic turnout and allocating them by the same percentage as the delegates that were awarded. Do that and Clinton loses about another 100,000 votes compared to Sanders. Rob Richie, executive director at Fair Vote, told us that approach is flawed, but his sense is the result is about right. "At the end of the day, Clinton has between 2.4 (million) and 2.5 million more votes than Sanders," Richie said. "It’s a little less, but not too much less, than what you see now." Our ruling Clinton said she has received 2.5 million more votes than Sanders. That claim can’t be completely verified because we don’t have the raw vote totals from the caucus states of Iowa, Nevada, Washington and Maine. However, given the numbers we do have, it is likely that Clinton’s lead is at least in the neighborhood of 2.4 million votes. That’s not much of a difference. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c11b6095-360d-41dc-8edb-02029001978d	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-05T18:15:14	2016-04-05	['None']
pomt-02181	"The Constitution simply does not authorize the federal government to own any of this land (in the Western states)."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/28/andrew-napolitano/napolitano-washington-lacks-constitutional-right-o/	As we heard over and over during the Nevada standoff between federal agents and Cliven Bundy and his gun-bearing supporters, this fight wasn’t about cows or tortoises, it was about land and who controls it. For Bundy, the starting point was clear. "I don’t recognize the United States government as even existing," Bundy said in an April 10 radio interview. Even in libertarian circles that is an extreme view, but Judge Andrew Napolitano of Fox News did lend his weight to the general argument that Washington is in the wrong. Napolitano was talking on Fox’s Hannity when the host pointed out Washington’s extensive holdings in the West. "Look at the percentage they own in Nevada, 81 percent. Utah, 66 percent. Idaho, 61 percent," Hannity said. "Why does the government own all of this land anyway?" "Sean, I'm going to make a statement that the government will consider outrageous," Napolitano warned. "The Constitution simply does not authorize the federal government to own any of this land. All of it is being held unconstitutionally and all of it should be returned to the private property owners from which it was taken or to the states in which it exists, period." We wanted to hear Napolitano’s legal explanation, but he did not get back to us. However, he is not the first to make this claim and we were able to review the legal record to see whether the federal government lacks the constitutional authority as he said. The short answer is that the Constitution, through the Property Clause, specifically gives the government the power to own land. Over time, the Supreme Court has ruled that not only does the government own the land, but it enjoys broad rights in deciding what happens on that land. In 2007, the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm that works on behalf of Democrats and Republicans, explored the legal roots of federal land ownership. Its finding was unambiguous. "The Property Clause gives Congress authority over federal property generally, and the Supreme Court has described Congress’ power to legislate under this Clause as ‘without limitation,’ " the researcher wrote. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank and activist organization in Washington, D.C., says much the same thing on its online guide to the Constitution. It provides the key text from Article IV of the Constitution. "The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States." The accompanying essay, by Columbia Law School professor Thomas Merrill, noted that many people have debated the scope of this clause. The most narrow interpretation, Merrill wrote, "simply allows Congress to act as an ordinary owner of land. It can set policy regarding whether such lands will be sold or retained and, if they are retained, who may enter these lands and for what purposes." For the purposes of this fact-check, even that limited approach leaves Napolitano high and dry. We asked another legal scholar at Heritage, John Malcolm, if we were misinterpreting anything. Malcolm told us we had it right. "I’m not aware of anything in the Constitution that would preclude the federal government from owning land in these western states," Malcolm told PunditFact. Critics of Malcolm’s view point to an 1845 Supreme Court decision having to do with control over rivers and other navigable waterways. The nut of this ruling, as we read on the libertarian website Armstrong Economics, is that "once a territory becomes a state, the (federal government) must surrender all claims to the land." This argument has special relevance for states such as Nevada and Utah that were formed from large swaths of land owned by Washington. By this legal logic, when those states entered the Union, the federal government lost the ability to own land there. But according to the Congressional Research Service, that interpretation is "contrary to the plain wording of the Constitution." On top of that, under the law that created Nevada in 1864, the state specifically agreed to give up any claim to "unappropriated public lands lying within said territory, and that the same shall be and remain at the sole and entire disposition of the United States." For you history buffs, the United States acquired the land (see map) that became Nevada, California, Utah, plus chunks of New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona from Mexico in 1848 through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican-American War. Mexico also ditched any claim to Texas. In exchange, the United States paid Mexico $15 million. Napolitano said the land should be returned but given this chain of title, it is hard to see who would have any claim. We doubt he is thinking of Mexico. That Congressional Research Service report along with Heritage Foundation’s guide note that since 1845, the Supreme Court has issued many decisions that strengthen the government’s hand. An 1897 case said Congress could block someone from putting up fences on private land if it blocked access to public land. In 1911, the court affirmed the use of large tracts of land as national forests, held in the public interest. John Leshy is a professor of real property law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law. Leshy served in the Interior Department in the Carter and Clinton administrations and was part of the transition team when President Barack Obama first took office. "Napolitano’s statement is absurd," Leshy said. "The constitutional basis of federal land ownership is not subject to any serious debate among scholars, and hasn’t been for a very long time." Our ruling Napolitano said the federal government has no constitutional authority to own land in many Western states. The underlying legal argument rests on a tenuous interpretation of constitutional language and the rejection of about 125 years of Supreme Court decisions. The legal scholars we reached, regardless of any political leanings they might have, agreed that the Constitution clearly grants Washington the power to own land and that arguments to the contrary are baseless.

pomt-05866	"The commercial property tax [in Providence] is second highest in the country behind Detroit."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/10/lincoln-chafee/rhode-island-governor-lincoln-chafee-says-commerci/	In his State of the State speech, Governor Lincoln Chafee declared this "the year of the cities and towns" and promised to work to relieve the burden on property taxpayers. "People who have worked hard and played by the rules their entire lives are worried because they may be one property tax payment away from losing their home or business," he said in the Jan. 31 speech. "We must reverse this trend." In the days afterward, the governor reiterated this commitment. During a Feb. 3 appearance on Channel 12’s "Newsmakers," Chafee pointed to the negative effects of an increasing reliance on property taxes in Rhode Island’s economically distressed communities -- Central Falls, West Warwick, Pawtucket and, of course, Providence. "And no wonder there’s empty stores in Providence," he said. "The commercial property tax is second highest in the country behind Detroit." The issue of property taxes has come to the fore in Providence with the ongoing fight between the financially struggling city and its tax-exempt nonprofits. Providence leans heavily on tax payments from businesses and residents to raise revenue. But is the city’s commercial property tax really the nation’s second highest? Chafee’s spokeswoman referred us to a report released last month by a financial panel advising Providence. The report, "A System Out of Balance," from the Commission on Revenue, Sustainability and Efficiency, recommended a series of changes to raise money for the city, including higher sales tax receipts, more state aid and larger contributions from Providence’s nine colleges and hospitals. To put the issue in context, the report included a comparison of commercial property tax burdens in Providence and other major cities across the country, taken from a joint study in 2010 by the nonpartisan Minnesota Taxpayers Association and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit think-tank. The "50-State Property Tax Comparison Study," which has been done periodically since 1995, examines property taxes across the country in three ways: by comparing taxes in the largest city in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the second-largest cities in Illinois and New York because Chicago and New York City have such idiosyncratic tax systems (so 53 cities in all); by comparing taxes in the 50 largest cities by population in the country; and by comparing the taxes in a single rural community in each of the 50 states. Providence was considered among the first group of 53 cities. It did indeed rank second for the highest commercial property taxes, behind only Detroit. Des Moines was third, Philadelphia fourth and New York City fifth. According to the study, for a commercial property valued at $1 million and with $200,000 in fixtures, the net property taxes in Providence would be $47,695 a year. The effective tax rate, which factors in statutory exemptions and assessment practices, would be 3.975 percent. The same property in Detroit would pay $48,141 for a rate of 4.012 percent. In contrast, that property in Cheyenne, Wyo., which ranked 53rd in the study, would pay $7,824 under a 0.652-percent rate. Providence is not included in the second group of the 50 largest cities in the country. (With 178,042 people, Rhode Island’s capital ranks 131st, according to the 2010 census.) If it were, it would still be second for commercial property taxes, again behind Detroit. If Providence were included in the third group of rural communities, it would rank second for commercial property taxes, behind Iola, Kan. Providence has moved up the list as its financial crisis has deepened in recent years: in 2007, the city ranked 16th for commercial property taxes. In 2009, it ranked sixth. It moved to second in 2010. So Providence does have the second-highest commercial property taxes in the most recent 50-state study. But although that study is certainly comprehensive, it is not exhaustive. It did not look at every city in the country. We looked for more research. Our first call was to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group based in Washington, D.C., that does state-by-state comparisons of tax issues. Joseph Henchman, director of state projects, referred us to a draft report that compared the tax burdens that identical hypothetical corporations would have in about 100 U.S. cities. (The study looked at two cities in most states; it looked at only one city in Rhode Island and other small states.) In that study, which has yet to be released, Providence would have the third-highest commercial property taxes for a corporate headquarters, according to Henchman, behind Des Moines and Columbia, S.C. "It’s looking like no matter how you do it, Rhode Island is not coming up real good," said Henchman. Our ruling Chafee said that Providence has the second-highest commercial property tax in the nation, citing a City of Providence report that cites the Minnesota report. Neither report makes that definitive claim. But the Minnesota report does say Providence is second highest in its comparison of 53 cities. And if Providence were included in comparisons of the nation’s largest cities, it would also rank second. A Tax Foundation study ranks Providence third for commercial property taxes by one measurement, but different ways of comparing tax burdens could account for the difference. It’s possible there are other cities with higher commercial property taxes, but we couldn’t find any. Although Chafee went a step too far in saying definitively that Providence’s commercial property tax is the second-highest in the country, there is ample evidence to support his statement and little that contradicts it. We rate the claim Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

Colmes: "Well, his mother was born here, so I guess like Obama, though it’s interesting to me that the people who had a problem with Obama’s birth certificate don’t have a problem with Ted Cruz, who literally was born in another country and renounced his Canadian citizenry." Grayson: "I don’t know. The Constitution says natural-born Americans, so now we’re counting Canadians as natural-born Americans? How does that work? I’m waiting for the moment that he gets the nomination and then I will file that beautiful lawsuit saying that he’s unqualified for the job because he’s ineligible." Colmes: "So you’re saying should he get the nomination, Alan Grayson will file a lawsuit against his candidacy?" Grayson: "Absolutely! Call me crazy, but I think the president of America should be an American." Well, congressman, Cruz is an American by any definition. He travels on a U.S. passport. He's a member of the U.S. Senate, which requires him to be a citizen for nine years. There is no gray area on whether he is an American. We pressed Grayson on whether he actually meant that Cruz is not an American and he raised the idea that his very citizenship, gained through his mother, is flawed. Cruz’s citizenship Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, on Dec. 22, 1970, to his Delaware-born mother Eleanor Darragh and Cuban-born father. If Darragh was an American, then under American law, Cruz was an American at birth. Not so fast, warns Grayson. He challenges the premise that Darragh was an American when Cruz was born. "Cruz’s father says that Cruz’s mother became a naturalized Canadian citizen," Grayson said through his spokesman Kevin Franck. Grayson argues that under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, there are two ways to lose your citizenship. You can become a naturalized citizen in another country or declare your allegiance to another nation. "If Cruz’s mother did either of these two things before his birth, then she lost her nationality, and Cruz could not rely upon her nationality to claim U.S. citizenship," Grayson said. The law isn't what Grayson says it is, which we'll get into in a moment. We asked Grayson to document that Darragh became a naturalized Canadian and he pointed us to a Web page that quotes an interview Cruz’s father gave to NPR. That interview actually does not support Grayson’s point. While Cruz’s father said he became a Canadian citizen, nowhere does he say that Darragh followed suit, much less that she did so before Cruz’s birth. So there is no evidence to support the allegation. We asked Grayson if he had anything else, and his spokesman said he did not. We asked the Cruz campaign to provide proof that Darragh remained an American citizen throughout her time in Canada, such as a residency document that she would need only if she were not a Canadian. They did not get back to us. But according to several immigration lawyers we reached, even if she had taken the Canadian oath, her American citizenship might have been at risk, but she would not have lost it automatically. In a pivotal 1967 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Afroyim vs. Rusk that a person only loses their citizenship if they specifically intend to give it up. Taking an oath of citizenship elsewhere doesn't qualify. "Our holding does no more than to give to this citizen that which is his own, a constitutional right to remain a citizen in a free country unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship," the justices wrote. But there's a kicker when it comes to Canada. Henry Chang, an immigration lawyer and partner in the law firm of Blaney McMurtry in Toronto, told us that in 1970, the Canadian oath had this strong language: "I hereby renounce all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign sovereign or state of whom or which I may at this time be a subject or citizen." A 1973 case in Canada led the country to drop that line. But until then, Chang said the original oath had the potential to impact Americans who adopted Canadian citizenship. "If someone took the old form of the Canadian oath of naturalization prior to April 3, 1973, which included the renunciatory language, it is much easier for the U.S. government to prove that they committed the expatriating act with the intention of renouncing their U.S. citizenship," Chang said. But that still wouldn’t automatically cost Darragh her citizenship. Chang and Lenni Benson, an immigration law professor at New York Law School, said that it’s up to the U.S. government to press the point. "If the government never challenged Sen. Cruz’s mother, it is very unlikely that the act of naturalizing in Canada formally would have caused her to lose her citizenship," Benson said. Chang amplified this point in an article on loss of citizenship. Chang noted that a 1980 Supreme Court ruling (Vance vs. Terrazas), and amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1986 declared that intent could not be assumed. The ruling and the law put the onus squarely on the government to prove that the person truly intended to renounce his or her citizenship. In legal parlance, giving up your citizenship is called an expatriating act. In 1990, the U.S. State Department issued this policy: "The Department has adopted an administrative presumption that a person intends to retain U.S. citizenship when he or she commits a potentially expatriating act." (An example of a potentially expatriating act would be becoming a citizen of another country.) In short, as a matter of law and policy, in the eyes of the law, taking an oath elsewhere does not automatically cost you your American citizenship. In 1988, Congress essentially shut the door on anyone who might want to go back and challenge someone’s citizenship before all these changes took effect. In a set of technical corrections to the 1986 amendments, it said the new law applied to actions that took place before 1986. The facts on the ground speak for themselves. When Cruz was about four, his parents moved to Texas. There is no evidence that the U.S. government ever challenged Darragh’s citizenship. It has always accepted Cruz as an American, based on his mother’s status. To go back and revisit Darragh’s status would put the government in the position of arguing a weak case that runs against a 25-year-old policy. A final note: Technically, Cruz was a dual-national, but to put the issue to rest, he formally renounced any claim to Canadian citizenship in May 2014. What it takes to be president Grayson also spoke about the constitutional requirement for a president to be a "natural-born citizen." We’ve looked at this before and the evidence falls heavily against Grayson’s position. The only sliver of uncertainty? There’s no Supreme Court ruling on this question. Most legal experts contend a "natural born citizen" means someone is a citizen from birth and doesn’t have to go through a naturalization process to become a citizen. Cruz has said he never went through that process. The Congressional Research Service, the agency tasked with providing authoritative research to all members of Congress, published a report after the 2008 election supporting the thinking that "natural born" citizenship means citizenship held "at birth." There are many legal and historical precedents to strongly back up this argument. Two former solicitor generals of opposing parties, Neal Katyal and Paul Clement, who worked for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, laid this out in an op-ed in the Harvard Law Review. In general, a child born with at least one American parent can claim citizenship regardless of where the birth took place. Grayson questions this, but that challenge has been rebuffed before. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., faced questions about his eligibility because he was born in the Panama Canal Zone while his father was stationed there. That did not prevent him from running as the GOP nominee in 2008. Despite this legal consensus, the fact remains that Supreme Court has never ruled on this matter and until it does, Cruz’s eligibility remains -- theoretically -- a slightly open question. Several citizens filed lawsuits asking the court to rule on whether McCain was a natural born citizen early in 2008, but the legal challenges didn’t go anywhere. Judges ruled that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue, a problem that Grayson would also face if he tried. Sarah Duggin, a professor of law at Catholic University who has researched this issue extensively, has said the courts would likely see this as a political matter over which they have no jurisdiction. Our ruling Grayson said that Cruz is ineligible to be president because "technically" he’s not American. The suggestion that Cruz isn’t an American is patently wrong. He gained his citizenship through his American mother the moment he was born. Cruz holds a U.S. passport and is a duly elected member of the U.S. Senate. While Grayson alleges that Cruz’s mother had lost her American citizenship while in Canada, the source he cited provided no evidence. Grayson provided no proof that Cruz’s mother had become a Canadian citizen. Even if she had, under current law and policy she would still be an American. And so, too, would Cruz.

pomt-01616	"Russia has more diversity in its governmental representation than we do in Texas."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/aug/29/lon-burnam/burnam-claim-about-russia-having-greater-partisan-/	A Democratic Texas legislator said the Republican governor, Rick Perry, has no basis for characterizing his indictments by a Travis County grand jury as a partisan attack. According to an Aug. 22, 2014, news blog post by the Dallas Morning News, state Rep. Lon Burnam of Fort Worth that day called Perry a "master of disinformation" on a conference call with reporters hosted by the Democratic National Committee. Burnam, the blog post said, accused Perry of trying to shrug off the charges against him as political payback for his veto of funding for the Public Integrity Unit, part of the Travis County district attorney’s office that polices state officials. Burnam said for Perry to complain that the unit had one-sidedly pursued Republicans was an attempt at misdirection. "When you have one-party rule for 20 years, most of the people who are going to be indicted for anything are going to be from that one party," Burnam said. "Russia has more diversity in its governmental representation than we do in Texas," he said. Hold on. Russia enjoys greater partisan representation than two-party Texas? We were intrigued. By the numbers For decades, of course, Texas has been reliably Republican. A Democrat hasn’t won statewide since 1994, Republicans have held every statewide elected office since 1999 and the GOP has retained majorities in the Texas House and Senate since 2003. Most recently, in the 2013 Legislature, Republicans held a 19-12 Senate advantage once Houston Democrat Sylvia Garcia was sworn into her seat at mid-session. Republicans had a 95-55 advantage in the House, according to a January 2013 tally by the Legislative Reference Library. Put another way, Republicans hold 63 percent of the state’s House and Senate seats and 100 percent of the statewide judicial and executive positions. Now, how about Russia? By telephone and email, Burnam said he based his declaration of Russia’s greater diversity on research by Tom "Smitty" Smith, director of Public Citizen’s Texas office, especially a breakdown of 2011 election results on a Russian elections and public opinion website, russiavotes.org, indicating seven parties drew votes for seats in the State Duma, or parliament, in the elections of Dec. 4, 2011. Members of United Russia, the party of Russia President Dmitriy Medvedev, drew 49 percent of the vote, followed by the Communist Party (19 percent), Fair Russia (14 percent), Liberal Democrats (12 percent) and Yabloko, Patriots of Russia and Right Cause, each at 1 percent or less. According to the information, four parties ultimately landed seats in the parliament. United Russia got 238 seats (53 percent); the Communist Party won 92 (20 percent); Fair Russia ended up with 64 (14 percent); and the Liberal Democrats drew 56 (12 percent). That’s right, according to the entry for Russia’s political parties in the CIA’s World Fact Book, which says that while 78 political parties were registered with Russia's Ministry of Justice as of January 2014, only the four parties had representation in its legislature. Burnam’s point: Russia has twice as many parties represented in its government than Texas. When is a party count not reflective of partisan differences? In Russia But there's more to consider, we were told by Russia experts. The academics we reached said it’s misleading to judge partisan representation just by counting parties. Only one of the parties with seats in Russia's State Duma -- Fair Russia -- might be considered critical of its chief of state, Vladimir Putin, Jonathan Ludwig, a senior lecturer at Rice University, said by email. Fair Russia members, he said, have voted against government budgets, and one member even voted against the country’s 2014 annexation of Crimea (though he’s not beloved, per a March 20, 2014, Washington Post news story). Meantime, the Liberal Democrats, Ludwig said, often vote in lockstep with Putin. "The Communist Party allies with Putin on supporting the close ties to the Russian Orthodox Church and in the anti-gay legislation (a holdover from Soviet-era laws)," Ludwig wrote. Based on how parliamentary votes break down, Ludwig said, generally "there is a strong inclination to line up behind the Kremlin, i.e., Putin." Graeme Robertson, a University of North Carolina specialist in Russian politics, similarly said the parties in the State Duma "are more or less acceptable to the regime and really critical opposition groups are not allowed to contest the elections, so diversity is in fact much more limited than it appears. At the state level the same 4 parties and one or two others are represented but United Russia holds a majority in all states (all 83)," Robertson emailed. "So again, not much diversity there." Since 2012, Robertson said, "the Duma has become even more of a rubber-stamp than it was before… This is the sort of thing that is so widely accepted among observers that few people would go to the bother of actually writing it up." By phone, Columbia University political scientist Timothy Frye, director of the Harriman Institute, formerly the Russian Institute, said there was greater diversity in Russian politics in the 1990s but since 2004, he said, the opposition parties are "allowed to hold their seats at the discretion of the ruling party." Of late, Frye said, "there are elections, there are campaigns; they’re all carefully controlled. There’s more appearance of diversity than actual diversity." By email, Burnam said if he had time to further research his point, it might be a hard call "on the question of diversity in the quality of the members of the respective legislative bodies as opposed to the obvious diversity in the numbers of people representing what party." There is more "actual party diversity in Russia than there is in Texas," he said. Our ruling Burnam said: "Russia has more diversity in its governmental representation than we do in Texas." We see a thread of truth here in that four parties have seats in the State Duma; just two parties hold legislative seats in Texas. But there’s little diversity permitted from the parties in the parliament, authorities advise. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CORRECTION, 11:07 a.m., Sept. 2, 2014: A reader pointed out we'd overstated the share of legislative seats held by Republicans in Texas. So we've amended this article to specify 63 percent (not 76 percent). This correction did not affect our rating of Burnam's claim.

pomt-00856	Polling shows that nearly 74 percent of National Rifle Association members "support requiring background checks for all gun sales."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/18/lena-taylor/most-nra-members-back-background-checks-all-gun-pu/	A bill that Gov. Scott Walker appears to favor would scrap a nearly 40-year-old Wisconsin law that requires a 48-hour waiting period for handgun purchases. Some opposition has emerged. In an unscientific poll on JSOnline, the website of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 70 percent of the more than 2,200 votes cast were for keeping the waiting period in place. The next day, March 12, 2015, state Sen. Lena Taylor expressed her opposition -- suggesting that even most members of the National Rifle Association, which fights restrictions on the right to bear handguns as well as long guns, would side with her against the bill. The Milwaukee Democrat issued a statement after the Republican-sponsored bill was approved by the Senate Judicial and Public Safety Committee in a 3-2 party-line vote. "Not including background checks (of) all types of firearms, ignoring the public safety and the mental health needs of our state is downright irresponsible," said Taylor, who cast one of the no votes. "Polling showed that even nearly 74 percent of NRA members support requiring background checks for all gun sales." Setting aside the fact Taylor is muddying the waters by implying a background check would go away -- it won’t -- let’s check her statistic on polling for NRA member support for such measures. Background checks Under federal law, states decide whether they want to process background checks to ensure that people who are prohibited by law from owning guns do not purchase one. In Wisconsin, the state Department of Justice does the checks for handguns, while the FBI does them for long guns. The state’s check of handgun purchasers includes a more extensive review of databases, such as those involving offenses committed by juveniles, than the FBI routinely does. The most recent state figures show that from July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, the state processed more than 196,000 background checks for handgun purchases. More than 99 percent of the applications were approved, including more than 29,000 that were approved instantly. The Department of Justice has said that on average, the background checks are done within four hours. The new legislation would not change the requirement for background checks. Supporters say that in most cases, since the checks are done quickly, there is no reason for people to have to wait 48 hours to take possession of the handgun they’re buying. Opponents worry about instances such as a couple getting in an argument and then running out to buy guns before they have a chance to cool off. The polling Now to what recent polling on background checks has found among the several million members of the politically powerful NRA. In March 2013, Lee Leffingwell, then the mayor of Austin, Texas, made a two-part claim that includes the claim Taylor made. He said 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of NRA members support background checks of gun purchasers. PolitiFact Texas rated his claim True. The key evidence was an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on a poll done in January 2013 by two entities at Johns Hopkins University -- the Department of Health Policy and Management and the Center for Gun Policy and Research. The poll was conducted online among 2,703 adults -- including 169 NRA members -- through GfK Knowledge Networks, which specializes in working with academic and government researchers to do polling online. It recruits participants randomly via mail and telephone. The poll found that 74 percent (to be precise, 73.7 percent) of NRA members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. (The margin of error was seven points.) This poll was the most on point that we could find in terms of Taylor’s claim. But we would also note two others done around the same time that included information on NRA households -- in other words, the person responding to the survey or someone in that household was an NRA member at the time. A CBS News/New York Times poll, also from January 2013, found that background checks on all potential gun buyers were favored by 85 percent of NRA households. And a February 2013 poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 74 percent of people in NRA households favored making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks. The NRA did not respond to our requests about Taylor’s claim. But as an organization, it opposes universal background checks. Two days after Taylor issued her statement, the NRA urged its members to oppose newly introduced legislation in Congress that would extend background checks to cover gun transactions at gun shows, over the Internet and in other settings. The statement on the NRA website said the federal bill "does not address the real problems of fixing the broken mental health system and prosecuting criminals. Further, criminals will never submit to such a system so it will never truly be ‘universal.’" Our rating Taylor said polling shows that nearly 74 percent of National Rifle Association members "support requiring background checks for all gun sales." The most recent national poll of NRA members that we could find, done in January 2013 by Johns Hopkins University, found that 73.7 percent of the members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. We rate Taylor’s statement True. Update: After this item was published, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker called us contending that the Johns Hopkins poll could not accurately survey NRA members because only the NRA has access to the list of current, dues-paying members. We are not adjusting our rating, as it is a common practice in polling to ask respondents to identify whether they are members of, for example, a political party or other group.

pomt-05468	Says "Cape May, Cumberland, Salem and part of Atlantic counties are all south of the Mason-Dixon line."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/22/raymond-bateman/former-state-legislator-claims-mason-dixon-line-cr/	New Jerseyans living in the northern and southern parts of the state already have plenty to divide them: politics, professional sports teams, and whether it’s called going "down the shore" or "to the beach." Now former state legislator Raymond Bateman has added another point of division: the Mason-Dixon Line, best known for separating free and slave states in the period leading up to the Civil War. Bateman, a Republican who served as a state assemblyman and senator for two decades before his failed gubernatorial bid in 1977, offered that historical claim in an April 9 opinion piece published on DailyRecord.com. The column focused on the split between northern and southern New Jersey in light of the fierce debate over merging Rutgers-Camden with Rowan University. "The political and cultural divisions between North and South Jersey are historic and run deep," Bateman wrote. "Early in 1861, on a train route to his first presidential inauguration, Abe Lincoln stopped in Trenton and addressed a joint session of the New Jersey Legislature. He was roundly booed and bombarded with inappropriate catcalls. "New Jersey’s North-South political landscape during the Civil War was definitely mixed — remember that Cape May, Cumberland, Salem and part of Atlantic counties are all south of the Mason-Dixon line." But PolitiFact New Jersey found that the Mason-Dixon Line never entered the Garden State. Although closely associated with the divide between free and slave states, the line was originally meant to settle a border dispute between the colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania, according to experts and historical records. The line runs north along the border between Delaware and Maryland, and then west along the Maryland-Pennsylvania border. Bateman acknowledged his claim is inaccurate, but said the presence of the Mason-Dixon Line in New Jersey has been a commonly held belief. "If I’m wrong, I’m wrong," Bateman, a Somerset County native, told us. "If that’s the authority, I stand corrected." Let’s trace the history behind the Mason-Dixon Line. The famous boundary gets its name from English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, called upon in the 1760s to establish the boundaries between Maryland and Pennsylvania. The Calvert family of Maryland and the Penn family of Pennsylvania had been engaged in a long-running dispute over their borders. The resulting border separated Delaware, which was then part of Pennsylvania, from Maryland and Pennsylvania. The line was later extended westward to form the boundary between Pennsylvania and what is now West Virginia. Matthew Crocker, a history professor at Keene State College in New Hampshire, said in an e-mail that "no part of N.J. was ever thought of being south of the Mason-Dixon Line." Joseph Bilby, a member of the New Jersey Civil War Sesquicentennial Committee and the author of several books on the state’s history, told us myth-makers "have been drawing political conclusions from this make-believe line crossing New Jersey for some time." "If you insist on drawing the line across from the Maryland/Pennsylvania border to the Atlantic Ocean, then yes, Southern New Jersey would be under that ‘line,’ although the line itself would be, of course, meaningless," Bilby said in an e-mail. The symbolic importance of the Mason-Dixon Line as dividing free and slave states increased as Pennsylvania’s gradual emancipation act took effect during the 1780s and 1790s, according to Max Grivno, an assistant history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi. "Tensions over slavery along the border increased steadily beginning in the 1790s, but they reached a climax in the 1850s when there were several violent skirmishes between runaway slaves and slave catchers in southern Pennsylvania," Grivno said in an e-mail. Our ruling In an April 9 opinion piece, Bateman claimed "Cape May, Cumberland, Salem and part of Atlantic counties are all south of the Mason-Dixon line." But historical records and experts confirmed that the Mason-Dixon Line never entered New Jersey. The boundary was first established in the 1760s to settle a border dispute between Maryland and Pennsylvania. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12692	"According to the FBI, Mexican drug cartels are working with 100,000 street gang members in Chicago alone."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/14/wayne-lapierre/are-mexican-drug-cartels-working-100000-street-gan/	Echoing President Donald Trump’s views on criminal activity in the United States, the top executive with the National Rifle Association recently said crime is going up in many American cities and raised concerns about the role Mexican criminal organizations play. "According to the FBI, drug gangs are expanding their networks all across the country. The FBI also says gang members are infiltrating law enforcement and even the military," Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, said Feb. 24 at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He continued: "On the outside, gangs are committing more and more cross-border crimes. According to the FBI, Mexican drug cartels are working with 100,000 street gang members in Chicago alone. Think about that." We were intrigued by LaPierre’s claim of Mexican drug cartels working with thousands of Chicago street gangs. An FBI report does offer this number, citing a media interview with a Drug Enforcement Agency special agent. But experts are skeptical about linking cartels to an estimated 100,000 street gang members in the city. National Gang Report The NRA referred us to a 2013 National Gang Report produced by the FBI’s National Gang Intelligence Center. It was compiled using surveys from the National Alliance of Gang Investigators Associations and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, open source reports and anecdotal information from gang investigators. The 2013 report affirmed that gangs in the United States have relationships with Mexican drug cartels and that they most commonly work with Los Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel. Specifically about Chicago: Mexican transnational criminal organizations "partner with more than 100,000 documented street gang members in Chicago to advance their criminal activities," the report said. That statistic cites a September 2012 article from the conservative website The Blaze. The Blaze’s article centers on an interview with Jack Riley, then special agent in charge for the Chicago Field Division of the DEA. (The FBI referred our questions to the DEA.) Riley told the website the Sinaloa cartel likely had the strongest presence in Chicago out of all Mexican drug cartels. The cartels have made Chicago one of their main hubs due to its location, large Mexican population and high street gang activity, Riley told The Blaze. They also played a role in the city’s violent crime, he said. Regarding the 100,000 gang members figure, The Blaze reported: "The drug cartels from Mexico have found willing business partners in more than 100,000 ‘documented’ street gang members in Chicago. The cartel operatives hide in plain sight, within the crowds of millions of hardworking Mexican citizens living in the city. "It’s the perfect cover," Riley said. That number came up again in a November 2012 interview with the Washington Post. Attributing information to the DEA, the Washington Post reported that members of the Sinaloa cartel are selling record amounts of heroin and methamphetamine from Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood and that drugs then make their way to south and west Chicago in mostly African-American neighborhoods. "Chicago, with 100,000 gang members to put the dope on the street, is a logistical winner for the Sinaloa cartel," Riley told the Washington Post. Experts weigh in John Hagedorn, a criminology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, raised questions about Mexican cartels partnering with 100,000 gang members in Chicago, as the 2013 report said. "The cartels have organizations in Chicago that supply mainly Latino gangs largely through kinship connections. Black gangs here have largely shattered and are not major wholesalers in drugs," said Hagedorn, who has researched gangs for more than three decades. "The statement that the cartels 'partner' with 100,000 gang members is untrue, to be charitable." DEA’s Riley has long linked the cartels to Chicago’s high rates of violence, Hagedorn said. While the cartels deal mainly with Latino gangs, the majority of homicide victims and offenders in Chicago are African-American, he said. Fulton T. Armstrong, a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University, also had doubts about linking Mexican cartels to 100,000 gang members -- almost 4 percent of Chicago’s estimated 2.7 million population, he noted. "I find the 100,000 figure very hard to believe. Law enforcement routinely exaggerates both the threats we face and their performance dealing with them," said Armstrong, who formerly was a national intelligence officer for Latin America, chief of staff of the CIA’s crime and narcotics center and career CIA officer. Armstrong said that when he also worked on the staff of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he repeatedly asked the DEA, the Office of National Drug Control Policy and other agencies for information on the flow of drugs within the country, but was told the data wasn’t available. His last unfulfilled request was in 2011, Armstrong said. Cartels' continued presence in Chicago The Sinaloa cartel exports and distributes wholesale amounts of methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin in the United States, James L. Jones, public information officer for the DEA’s Chicago field office told PolitiFact. "It maintains the most expansive international footprint amongst Mexican cartels," Jones said. It also remains the largest supplier of drugs to the Chicago area and uses street gangs for distribution, Jones said. "Chicago is home to an estimated 100,000 active gang members that are heavily involved in drug trafficking, violent crime, and other criminal activity," Jones said. "These gangs operate as the primary mid-level and retail-level distributors of drugs in the city and are responsible for a significant portion of the city’s violent crime." But it is not clear whether the 100,000 active gang members are all linked to Mexican cartels, which is what is suggested in LaPierre's original citation of the FBI. We asked the DEA for clarification on an estimate of how many or what percentage of the 100,000 are working with the cartels. "That’s tough to quantify," Jones said. "However, we know that cartels are the source for the drugs that are being distributed by the street gangs in Chicago." The 2013 gang report cited by the NRA is not the latest version of the report. The 2015 report no longer references the specific figure, but also notes that due to new survey methodology, the 2015 and 2013 reports do not compare. The 2013 report also offers an overall cautionary note: "Due to inconclusive reporting and lack of confidence in estimates collected from the (National Gang Survey), the (National Gang Report) does not contain numbers or estimates of gang members in the United States." It recommends contacting local agencies for more information. We reached out to the Chicago Police Department for the estimated number of street gang members in Chicago and how many of them are believed to be working with Mexican drug cartels. The department’s office of news affairs said it did not have a way to immediately provide a count. (AP in January citing the Chicago Crime Commission reported that the city had more than 150,000 street gang members, but many are not active. In January 2012, the commission released a gang book estimating there were more than 68,000 gang members in the city.) Our ruling LaPierre said, "According to the FBI, Mexican drug cartels are working with 100,000 street gang members in Chicago alone." LaPierre cites data in a 2013 national gang report produced by the FBI’s National Gang Intelligence Center. But it’s hard to gauge how solid that figure is, and experts question its veracity. The figure tracks back to a 2012 interview of a DEA special agent in The Blaze. The DEA told PolitiFact there’s an estimated 100,000 gang members in Chicago heavily involved in drug trafficking. It’s hard to quantify exactly how many of them are working with cartels, though cartels are the source for the drugs distributed by street gangs in Chicago, the DEA said. Independent experts, meanwhile, are skeptical about generalizing that all 100,000 street gang members — Latino and non-Latino — are collaborating with cartels, since the cartels mainly collaborate with Latino street gangs.

pomt-00062	Says that after the overdose death of a Tomah VA veteran, she "brought both parties together to help pass a law" to "make the VA accountable and also to stop the overprescribing of" opioids.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/nov/02/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-bipartisan-bill-claim-scores-comes-caveat/	The opioid crisis has devastated communities, claimed lives and become a major campaign issue. In the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race, Republican challenger Leah Vukmir has slammed U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, over an overprescription scandal at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In response, Baldwin launched her own campaign ad featuring the parents of late Marine Jason Simcakoski that claims that -- in the wake of the death -- Baldwin "brought both parties together to help pass a law" to "make the VA accountable and also to stop the overprescribing of" opioids. That’s what we want to look at here. The background To be sure, Baldwin’s ad sidesteps what happened in Tomah and the role she and her office played in handling information from a whistleblower. As we have noted in earlier items: Problems at the Tomah VA first made news in January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. Doctors had been handing out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans had taken to calling the place "Candy Land." Prior to that, on Aug. 29, 2014, Baldwin’s office received a report from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Office of Inspector General following a 2½-year investigation of Tomah. Baldwin did not make the report public, though she shared it with a constituent who had complained to her about what was happening at Tomah. The report was not given to any other member of Congress at the time. A day later, Simcakoski died of a "mixed use toxicity" overdose at the Tomah VA while being treated by doctors there. Simcakoski had checked himself into the facility citing an addiction to painkillers and severe anxiety. He was prescribed 15 drugs, including anti-psychotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and the opioid painkiller tramadol. In fact, after months of criticism about inaction on a whistleblower’s complaints about Tomah, Baldwin acknowledged her office had made mistakes, leading her to fire one staffer, demote another and dock the pay of her chief of staff. Vukmir has hammered Baldwin for months over the issue. During a September 2018 appearance on "Capital City Sunday" on WKOW-TV, she said Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation "to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids" at the Tomah VA, "later a veteran died" and Baldwin "covered it up." We rated Vukmir’s overall claim Mostly False. We found that Baldwin was the only one with the report and that she didn’t make the report public or go public with her concerns until the scandal made news. But she received the report only a day before the veteran died and -- while she did not publicize it -- an investigation by the U.S. Senate Ethics Select Committee into allegations of a coverup found the complaints lacked merit. Now to Baldwin’s claim What happened next In her claim, Baldwin is referring to legislation she co-authored -- the "Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act." On the campaign trail, Baldwin has referred to it as "Jason’s Law." And that’s what Baldwin’s campaign pointed to when we asked for evidence to support her claim. "Jason’s Law includes multiple measures designed to hold the VA system more accountable for the care of veterans and provide stricter opioid prescription guidelines," said campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt. "Since being signed into law, Jason’s Law has helped improve the VA, where they’ve seen lower opioid prescribing rates and increased numbers of physicians who receive updated training." Now to the specifics: Bipartisan bill: According to a June 22, 2015 news release, Baldwin and U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., introduced the initial measure. The news release shows supporters at the time included 11 other senators -- nine of them Democrats and two of them Republicans. Among the Republicans: Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. A July 13, 2016 report from WSAW TV and the Associated Press said Baldwin’s bill and one from U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, a Wisconsin Democrat, were included in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, made up of 12 bills. That measure passed the Senate in a 94-1 vote. On July 22, 2016, President Obama signed the package into law. Johnson himself referred to the measure as "a bipartisan step." VA accountability/overprescribing: That portion of the claim is supported by a May 9, 2018 appearance by VA Deputy Under Secretary Carolyn Clancy on C-SPAN. In the interview, Clancy said "we’ve seen a 47 percent decrease in the number of veterans on chronic opioids in Tomah, which is a little ahead of the national average. We’ve made great progress overall. For the proportion of patients on both a benzodiazepine and an opioid, which has a very high risk of adverse events, the decrease has been 76 percent at Tomah which is a little bit ahead of the national decrease." In April 2018, the Tomah VA became one of 18 veterans hospitals across the country involved in the "Whole Health" program. The program considers the physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and environmental elements that work together to provide the best quality of life for each veteran, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs. "We will never eradicate the need for opioids, but I think by combining it with the nontraditional therapy and taking the whole look at the veteran and veterans' needs, we will be able to manage pain and still let the veterans have a quality of life that they need," Victoria Brahm, director of the Tomah VA, said in an April 23, 2018 Associated Press story. So, on the narrow points of Baldwin’s claim, she is on target -- even as she ignores missteps by her office that could have mitigated the problems. Alec Zimmerman, spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said Baldwin had left "our state’s heroes in danger" and that rather than taking immediate action "was trying to save her political future." Our rating A Baldwin campaign ad claims she "brought both parties together to help pass a law" to "make the VA accountable and also to stop the overprescribing of" opioids. The action came only after the overprescription scandal made headlines -- something ignored in the ad. Likewise, the ad sidesteps key missteps by Baldwin’s own office. Nevertheless, the claims in this ad are narrowly drawn. We rate Baldwin’s claim Mostly True.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2018-11-02T14:31:34	2018-09-26	['None']
pomt-09482	"I'm glad for the wording of it (an ethics report on corporate-sponsored Congressional trips) because clearly the wording exonerates me."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/26/charles-rangel/rangel-sais-ethics-report-exonerates-him/	Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., has been under investigation for eight months, accused of violating congressional gift rules by letting corporations pay for Caribbean trips in 2007 and 2008. Soon after the House Ethics Committee released a report on Feb. 26, 2010, admonishing Rangel for making the trips, he defiantly insisted the report cleared him of wrongdoing. "I'm glad for the wording of it because clearly the wording exonerates me," Rangel said. What? The ethics report found that Rangel's aides tried at least three times -- twice in memos and once in a letter to him -- to show him that his Caribbean trips had corporate sponsors, but he denied seeing any of them. And he says his staff never told him about them. The ethics committee concluded there was no evidence that he did see the correspondences sent to him. But the report did not clear him of responsibility. Here's what the letter accompanying the ethics report states: "The Report further finds that Representative Charles B. Rangel violated the House gift rule by accepting payment or reimbursement for travel to the 2007 and 2008 conferences. The evidence shows that members of Representative Rangel's staff knew that corporations had contributed funds to Carib News specifically for the 2007 and 2008 conferences. This information was not provided to the Standards Committee when he sought and received approval from the Committee to accept these trips. The Committee does not find sufficient evidence to conclude, nor does it believe that it would discover additional evidence to alter its conclusion, that Representative Rangel had actual knowledge of the memoranda written by his staff. However, the report finds that Representative Rangel was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff in the performance of their official duties. It is the intention of the Committee that the publication of this Report will serve as a public admonishment by the Standards Committee of Representative Rangel. The Committee will also require Representative Rangel to repay the costs of the trips to the respective entities that paid for his travel." Rangel argues that the report did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that he had direct knowledge of the corporate sponsorship of his travel, so that means he was "exonerated." "Members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoings or mistakes or errors of staff," Rangel said. The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines "exonerate" as: "to relieve of a responsibility, obligation, or hardship; to clear from accusation or blame." The ethics report did not do that. In fact, the report found that Rangel "was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff." And the report included a "public admonishment" of Rangel. The ethics panel did exonerate five other members of the Congressional Black Caucus who went on the same trips, multinational business conferences held in Antigua and Barbuda in November 2007 and St. Maarten in November 2008. The report concluded that their respective staff members didn't know about the corporations paying for the trips, so the members of Congress did not knowingly violate any rules and committed no wrongdoing because they were "provided false information by others, and relied upon that information in seeking approval to accept the trips." Nonetheless, the report states, the trips were "impermissible gifts," and they must repay the cost of the travel. As for Rangel, chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, a New York Times story on Feb. 26, 2010, notes that the ethics panel, the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, "is still examining more serious dealings involving Mr. Rangel, including campaign finance issues, failure to pay federal taxes on rental income from a Dominican villa and the use of rent-stabilized apartments." At a news briefing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Rangel is entitled to "have his day" before the ethics committee on those allegations. "They (the ethics committee members) have said he did not knowingly violate the rules," Pelosi said. "And again, if this were the end of it, that would be one thing, but there's obviously more to come, and we'll see what happens with that. But every member has that right. "I think it's quite a statement to hold members accountable for what their staffs knew," Pelosi said. "I would be interested to see how that reverberates. But we have to place our confidence appropriately, and we’re held responsible for that." You can agree with the ethics panel ruling or not, but the fact is it found that even if Rangel had no direct knowledge of the staff memos warning him about corporate sponsorship, Rangel "was responsible for the knowledge and actions of his staff in the performance of their official duties." There's just no way to spin that into "exoneration." To the contrary, the ethics report included a public admonishment of Rangel. And so we rule Rangel's comment Pants on Fire!

pomt-05439	Says President Barack Obama's parents were communists.	false	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/27/samuel-wurzelbacher/samuel-joe-plumber-wurzelbacher-says-barack-obamas/	Ohio congressional candidate Samuel "Joe the Plumber" Wurzelbacher first gained national attention after querying presidential candidate Barack Obama’s about tax policy during a televised 2008 campaign appearance in the Toledo area. As the GOP nominee to challenge Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur in the 2012 election, Wurzelbacher recently made news again when the Christian Broadcasting Network website published a letter he wrote about Obama’s religious faith as well as his own Christian beliefs. Wurzelbacher told the website he plans to distribute the letter titled: ‘I’m Blessed to be a Christian," to churches during his upcoming congressional campaign. Wurzelbacher’s letter doesn’t address Kaptur. It mostly dwells on Obama. Wurzelbacher says he believes Obama is a Christian, and it’s not Christian for people to say otherwise. Wurzelbacher’s letter also provided a colorful rendition of Obama’s background: "Imagine being the child of a mixed-race marriage - especially in the turbulent 60’s and free-wheeling 70’s," his letter said. "And when you throw in that dad was a Muslim and mom an atheist - you know it could not have been easy - and they were communists for crying out loud!" Communists? That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. We thought we’d check out Wurzelbacher’s claim. When asked for evidence that Obama’s parents were communists, Wurzelbacher’s campaign spokesman Reece Collins supplied a 2007 Chicago Tribune article about Obama’s mother, Stanley Ann Dunham. The article stated that Dunham attended a Washington state high school where a teacher asked students to read "The Communist Manifesto" and the school board chairman told the House Un-American Activities Subcommittee that he had been a communist Party member. A classmate of Dunham’s called her "a fellow traveler," and claimed "We were liberals before we knew what liberals were." The Merriam Webster dictionary says the term "fellow traveler" describes someone who "sympathizes with and often furthers the ideals and program of an organized group (as the Communist Party) without membership in the group or regular participation in its activities." While the expression often describes people with communist leanings, Dunham’s classmate appears to apply it towards her liberal sympathies. Nor does graduating from a high school where students read the "TheCommunist Manifesto" and a school board member was a Communist party member mean that Dunham herself was a communist, as Wurzelbacher alleges. Claims that Obama’s estranged father was a communist are more widespread on conservative websites. Collins forwarded a profile of Obama from DiscoverLinks which describes the senior Obama as "a communist who had left his rural Luo-speaking village and his own Muslim father to become an agnostic and study economics abroad." Several editorials in the conservative Investor’s Business Daily also call Obama’s father a "communist." Many claims that the senior Obama was a communist derive from a 1965 article he authored in East Africa Journal. The article titled "Problems Facing Our Socialism," critiques an earlier economic paper released by Kenya’s government. In it, the elder Obama argues for removing "the disparities in our country such as the concentration of economic power in Asian and European hands while not destroying what has already been achieved and at the same time assimilating these groups to build one country." "What is more important is to find means by which we can redistribute our economic gains to the benefit of all and at the same time be able to channel some of these gains to future production," Obama’s father wrote. "This is the government’s obligation: it should have come out with a plan in the paper to achieve this." When Politico tracked down the 1965 paper before the last presidential election, it sought an evaluation from Kenya expert Raymond Omwami, an economist who was a visiting UCLA professor. Omwami told Politico that the elder Obama didn’t endorse radical politics, but instead criticized the policies of Kenya’s Ministry of Economic Planning and Development, "which applied African socialism principles to the country’s ongoing political upheaval." Omwami said Obama’s paper responded to a government document that suggested Kenya should concentrate its financial aid in more populous areas in hopes that positive effects would trickle down to smaller villages. "The critics of this article are making a big mistake," Omwami told Politico. "They are assuming Obama senior is the one who came up with this concept of African socialism, but that’s totally wrong. Based on that, they’re imbuing in him the idea that he himself is a socialist, but he is not." Omwami told Politico he would instead refer to the elder Obama as "a liberal person who believed in market forces but understood its limitations." To settle the question of whether Obama’s parents were communists, we also consulted authors of a pair of books about the president, who have extensively researched the president’s background. Harvard University historian James T. Kloppenberg, who wrote a 2010 book on Obama’s intellectual roots called "Reading Obama: Dreams, Hope, and the American Political Tradition," says he’s confident that Obama’s parents were not communists. "Obama’s mother was left of center, as was his father," Kloppenberg wrote in an email. "But I found no evidence to indicate that either of them ever affiliated with any Communist movements." Likewise, Cincinnati native David Mendell, a former Chicago Tribune political writer who authored a biography of Obama titled "Obama: From Promise to Power," also says there’s no evidence to back up Wurzelbacher’s assertion that Obama’s parents were communists. Mendell calls Obama’s mother "a traditional Adlai Stevenson liberal," and said it’s unlikely that Obama’s largely absent father was a communist because "there aren’t many communist economists." Mendell said his research didn’t unearth any communist ties to Obama’s Indonesian stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, an oil company employee. And Mendell says the maternal grandmother who played a big role in raising Obama, Madelyn Dunham, was a conservative Republican. "I have never heard him or anyone in his family espouse any kinship with the old Soviet Union," Mendell said of Obama. The evidence that Wurzelbacher produced doesn’t back his claim. There does not seem to be any proof that Obama’s mother was a communist. Nor does the 1965 paper authored by Obama’s estranged father verify that he was a communist. And authors of books on Obama say there’s no evidence that Obama’s parents were communists.

pomt-11828	"Many firearms experts determined the Las Vegas shooter’s use of a bump stock actually prevented more casualties and (injuries) due to its inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control."	false	/georgia/statements/2017/nov/13/michael-williams-georgia/did-bump-stocks-prevent-more-casualties-las-vegas/	Some legislators see the legal manufacture and use of bump stocks — found on 12 of the 23 guns in the Las Vegas gunman’s Mandalay Bay hotel room — as a loophole in firearms regulation. State Sen. Michael Williams, a Republican candidate running in Georgia’s gubernatorial primary, recently came out against any legislation banning the devices, which can be attached to a semiautomatic weapon to simulate the rate of fire of a fully automatic weapon. To stress his point, he announced he would give away a free bump stock to a random person who enters the giveaway event. "The tragedy in Las Vegas broke my heart, but any talk of banning or regulating bump stocks is merely cheap political lip service from career politicians," Williams said in a news release. "In reality, the bump stock is the new, shiny object politicians are using to deceive voters into believing they are taking action against gun violence." Williams continued: "Many firearms experts determined the Las Vegas shooter’s use of a bump stock actually prevented more casualties and injures (sic) due to its inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control." That didn’t sound right to us, because the basic point of a bump stock is to help someone shoot really fast. The device allows the recoil from firing a semiautomatic weapon to slide the firearm back and forth. The movement "bumps" the trigger against the shooter’s finger without having to manually squeeze the trigger for each shot. We should note that police have not yet said precisely which weapons were used in the shooting. But we wanted to look into the claim that the gunman would have hurt fewer people had he not had the ability to fire rapidly. Is this a popular expert opinion? What the experts say So who are these experts? We reached out to Williams and his campaign but received no response. The campaign has previously pointed to a post from Legally Armed America — written by Paul Glasco, who reviews guns and gun products — that argued that a ban on bump fire stocks would be useless to prevent these kind of attacks. As part of our own research, we talked to five experts who said Williams is factually correct on one point about the nature of this attachment: Because because bump stocks use a weapon’s recoil to allow the user to fire rapidly and repeatedly, the use of a bump stock makes the weapon more difficult to control when firing. This decreases the weapon’s accuracy, which depends on a weapon’s steadiness. Two experts supportive of gun rights — United States Concealed Carry Association president Tim Schmidt and lawyer John Pierce — were not convinced bump stocks would have made the crime more deadly. They agreed that a more accurate weapon could have hurt more people, but they needed more information about the crime to come to a conclusion. But three of the five experts said the rapid gunfire is likely what made the recent shooting so devastating. Precise aim was not a requirement; hundreds were injured. Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in firearms, said the use of a semiautomatic weapon without a bump stock would have made a difference if the Las Vegas gunman was trying to hurt a specific person. "When you don’t care who you hit, being a little more inaccurate doesn’t matter," Winkler said. To be fair, Arthur Alphin, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and West Point graduate, made the case to the Los Angeles Times that accuracy did matter, but so did the rapid fire. The weapon could have been held steady with a bipod, which was found in the gunman’s room. If the gunman had been trained by military or law enforcement, an unaltered semiautomatic weapon could have been more harmful than one outfitted with a bump stock, said Rick Vasquez, a former assistant chief and acting chief of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ firearms technology branch. But given the gunman’s lack of formal training and the fact that the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest music festival was somewhat blocked in, "any device that is going to spray a lot of ammunition is going to be more deadly," Vasquez said. "He was shooting into a densely packed crowd of thousands of people," said Gary Kleck, a criminologist from Florida State University who studies the effects of guns on injuries and death in crimes. "The main effect of using bump stocks in this particular situation was to increase the number of rounds the shooter could fire in a short period of time before police crashed into his hotel room, which increased the numbers of victims hit somewhat randomly." The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department declined to comment, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. Our ruling Williams said many firearms experts have determined that the use of a bump stock in the Las Vegas shooting prevented more injuries and deaths than would have otherwise occurred had he not used a bump stock. Outside of a blog from a pro-gun rights group, we did not find "many firearms experts" making that argument. We did learn that bump stock devices tend to affect a weapon’s accuracy. But we found several firearms experts who attributed the high number of people injured and killed to the shooter’s ability to fire rapidly, which a bump stock would have amplified.

pomt-05436	Says Mitt Romney’s top five donors are Wall Street firms, while Barack Obama’s top five are technology companies and universities.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/27/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-romneys-top-donors-come/	A reader recently sent us a Facebook post that put photographs of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama side by side to make a point about their biggest campaign donors. The post is headlined, "Top 5 campaign contributors." For Romney, it lists, "1) Goldman Sachs, 2) JPMorgan Chase, 3) Morgan Stanley, 4) Credit Suisse Group (financial group headquartered in Zurich), 5) Citigroup." For Obama, it lists, "1) Microsoft, 2) DLA Piper (legal group specializing in technology), 3) Google, 4) University of California, 5) Harvard University." Presumably, the point of the post is that Romney is tied to Wall Street interests, whereas Obama is tied to the technology and academic sectors. (The post says, "The list speaks for itself we think.") The undated post attributes the information to OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan website that includes a campaign finance database. So that’s where we went to verify the information. Campaign finance rankings change as new donations come in and are recorded in the database, so the accuracy might depend on how recently the Facebook list was compiled. It turns out that, as of April 27, 2012, OpenSecrets.org’s "top contributors" lists closely matched the Facebook post for both candidates. Here’s Romney’s top six: 1. Goldman Sachs ($564,580) 2. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ($400,675) 3. Bank of America ($364,850) 4. Morgan Stanley ($363,550) 5. Credit Suisse Group ($316,160) 6. Citigroup Inc ($286,015) So, five of the six top "contributors" to Romney were identical on the two lists, and the new addition was Bank of America, another financial institution. Here’s Obama’s top six: 1. Microsoft Corp. ($304,690) 2. DLA Piper ($302,527) 3. University of California ($243,486) 4. Sidley Austin LLP ($234,611) 5. Google Inc. ($191,719) 6. Harvard University ($177,408) Once again, five of the six match, with the newcomer to the list -- Sidley Austin LLP -- a law and lobbying firm. There are two problems with the lists, however. The first is that it’s not really accurate to call DLA Piper a "legal group specializing in technology." It’s a global law firm that also does lobbying; its law and lobbying clients are widely scattered in various industries and sectors and it has 4,200 lawyers in 77 offices in 31 countries. The firm does represent some technology clients, but in the past few years, it has also filed lobbying disclosure forms for its representation of energy companies, drugmakers, food companies, defense contractors, hotel chains and a grab bag of others, from the PGA Tour to General Cigar Holdings to Snowsports Industries America. In fact, DLA Piper even signed up to lobby for several financial-industry firms of the type that the Facebook post seemingly criticizes Romney for representing. They include Discover Financial Services, Charles Schwab Corp. and the now-defunct Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers. The second problem is broader. The Facebook post makes it sound like the groups listed for each candidate actually gave money to the campaign. But corporations are prohibited from making direct contributions to candidate committees such as Romney's and Obama's. OpenSecrets.org makes the following note on the charts and marks it in red, italic type for emphasis: "The organizations themselves did not donate, rather the money came from the organizations' PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals' immediate families." So what these top-contributors lists show is not that Google gave money to Obama, but that employees of Google gave money of their own volition, either directly or through a company-sponsored political action committee. Our ruling Even though the post may have been several months old by the time we checked it, the list of each candidate’s top contributors was pretty accurate, although it doesn't quite match the latest version from OpenSecrets. But the Facebook post doesn’t accurately describe what the list means. First, it incorrectly labels one of Obama’s donors. Second, the companies and colleges did not donate to Obama and Romney; their employees or related PACs did, which is an important detail. On balance, we rate the post Half True.

pomt-00831	Ted Cruz was "the longest-serving solicitor general in the history of Texas."	true	/texas/statements/2015/mar/25/jerry-falwell/ted-cruz-longest-serving-solicitor-general-texas-j/	Republican Ted Cruz declared his candidacy for president to an enthusiastic crowd at Liberty University in Virginia after being introduced by the Christian institution’s president, Jerry Falwell. Falwell, whose late father founded the university in 1971, introduced the Texas senator on March 23, 2015 by proclaiming Cruz accomplishments, including: "In 2003, he became the solicitor general of Texas, the youngest in the country at that time." Falwell went on: "He left only after becoming the longest-serving solicitor general in the history of Texas, achieving an unprecedented series of landmark national victories before the U.S. Supreme Court." We’re not sure how to tally landmark court wins; time will tell. But did Cruz set a record for service as the Lone Star State’s chief litigator in state and federal appellate courts? It's a short history We first contacted the Texas attorney general's office to inquire about the individuals who have held the title of Texas solicitor general. We learned the post has only been around since January 1999, which would have coincided with John Cornyn, now the state’s senior senator, getting sworn in for his term as attorney general. Before that, the only other position in Texas government that resembled the role of solicitor general was called state solicitor, according to Renea Hicks, an Austin lawyer who formerly held the title. "There was no office like solicitor general in the state up until 1994," Hicks said by phone. "At that point, the attorney general created the position called state solicitor and that was me." Hicks said instead of having a team of lawyers to work on appeals like the current solicitor general, he alone reviewed legal briefs and helped prepare appellate attorneys for court appearances. "It hadn’t grown into anything like the full-fledged division of what it is now," Hicks said. Hicks said he served in the role for about year before leaving the AG’s office, but no one formally replaced him until Cornyn established the Office of Solicitor General in 1999. "He had liked the idea of someone in charge of appellate" litigation "for the state," Hicks said. So Hicks had his year. And what about individuals later named solicitor general? Solicitors general for Texas A spokeswoman for the AG’s office, Lauri Saathoff, emailed us the following list of Texas solicitors general: Solicitor General, Texas Attorney General’s Office Time Served Duration Gregory Coleman 09/1999 – 08/2001 1 year and 11 months Julie Parsley 08/2001 – 11/2002 1 year and 3 months Rafael Edward 02/2003 – 05/2008 5 years and 3 months James Ho 04/2008 – 12/2010 2 years and 8 months Jonathan Mitchell 11/2010 – 01/2015 4 years and 2 months Scott Keller 12/2014 – Present 3 months and counting Source: Email, Lauri Saathoff, Press Secretary, Texas Attorney General’s Office, March 23, 2015 We also checked these names in Who’s Who, where we found that the years Coleman, Cruz and Ho served as solicitor general listed in the database matched the Saathoff's information. In the cases of Parsley and Mitchell -- where the data in Who’s Who was either incomplete or missing -- we checked online websites. The website for Parsley’s current law firm shows the attorney worked as solicitor general from August 2001 to November 2002. Meanwhile, Mitchell’s faculty page at the University of Texas School of Law states the visiting professor was appointed to the position in 2010 and stepped down in January 2015. Our ruling Falwell said Ted Cruz was "the longest-serving solicitor general in the history of Texas." That post has been around less than 20 years. Still, Cruz held it more than five years, longer than any of the lawyers who preceded and followed him and outpacing the second-longest holder by about a year. We rate this statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-09555	Says a prank phone call caused "400 children to be taken from their parents... without warrant."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/02/debra-medina/medina-says-400-children-were-taken-their-parents-/	Republican Debra Medina recently issued a call to action asking fellow Texans to join her in "the fight for freedom" that she's dubbed the cornerstone of her campaign for governor. "Why have we Texans allowed 400 children to be taken from their parents, from a prank call, without warrant?" her Jan. 27 e-mail states. "This is NOT FREEDOM." Medina didn't respond to several phone calls to elaborate on what she meant. But it’s all but certain she was referring to the Yearning for Zion Ranch raided by state officials in April 2008, leading to 439 children being placed into foster care for about two months while authorities investigated child abuse suspicions about men living on the ranch outside Eldorado, where a polygamist sect of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints had settled. By all accounts, a March 30, 2008, telephone call to a West Texas family violence shelter led the shelter to contact state officials who then got a judge’s permission to raid the ranch. The judge also authorized the removal of children from the ranch. Authorities said then that the crucial initial call came from a 16-year-old girl who told the shelter she’d suffered sexual and physical abuse at the hands of her husband on the ranch. Texans watching the saga—including the separation of many children from their mothers and siblings—grew uncertain over whether state officials had overstepped their lawful duty to intervene in response to reports of child abuse or neglect. In May 2008, the Texas Supreme Court ordered all but a handful of the children to be returned to the ranch. The court further ruled that the state went too far by removing every child. It also said the state failed to show that any more than five teenage girls were being sexually abused or that prepubescent children were in danger. In the following months, however, officials filed criminal charges ranging from bigamy to sexual assault of a child against 12 men connected with the ranch, including sect leader Warren Jeffs, 54. Last November, Raymond Jessop, 38, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting an underage girl with whom he had a "spiritual marriage." His young wife had become pregnant at age 16. But the state has ended its day-to-day oversight of the ranch residents; the last girl returned from foster care in August 2009. And officials never found anyone who admitted to being the girl authorities say called the crisis center. They did determine, however, that the call was made from a phone in an apartment in Colorado Springs, Colo., then home to Rozita Swinton, a woman who has been convicted making another hoax call. Spokesman Patrick Crimmins of the Texas Department of Family Protective Services, which oversees Child Protective Services, the agency responsible for investigating suspicions of abuse and neglect, conceded that the call from Colorado prompted investigators to seek judicial approval to visit the ranch. But Crimmins disputed the notion that the call—hoax or not—prompted the removal of children. "Once caseworkers arrived at the YFZ Ranch," Crimmins said, "the investigation that occurred and the subsequent removal was based on what investigators found — evidence of abuse." A December 2008 DFPS report concluded that 12 girls who’d been living on the ranch were victims of sexual abuse. The report said more than 260 children suffered neglect because they were exposed to sexual abuse in their households. Medina correctly said more than 400 children were taken from their parents. And the detention of the children happened after state authorities were called by the shelter that fielded a call from Colorado that may have been a hoax — though no authority has proved the call was a prank. Significantly, the removal of children didn’t solely occur because of the call, as Crimmins said. The children were taken temporarily based on what investigators saw upon the raid. Therefore, Medina's additional claim that the children were removed "without warrant" isn't supported. We rate Medina's claim Half True.

pomt-08235	"We haven’t had control of the House for the last two years and it’s been malfunctioning. We had 109 sessions scheduled and held 49."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/16/bill-batchelder/republican-state-rep-william-batchelder-knocks-dem/	Democrats’ two-year control of the Ohio House of Representatives came to an abrupt end with the Nov. 2 election. Republicans dominated, winning the governor’s office, all other statewide executive offices and control of the House. What impact the Republican takeover of the House will have on the average Ohioan is unknown, but one thing seems clear: House members, coming off an election year with an extended summer break, will be called to work more often under the new leadership. Republican state Rep. Bill Batchelder, who will take over as Ohio House speaker in January, was outspoken during the campaign about the House's productivity under Democratic leadership. He pointed to the high number of legislative sessions House Speaker Armond Budish canceled. "We haven’t had control of the House for the last two years and it’s been malfunctioning," Batchelder, of Medina, told the Brunswick Sun News in mid-October. "We had 109 sessions scheduled and held 49." Given his critique of Budish, it will be worth checking how often Batchelder, once he becomes House speaker, cancels scheduled House sessions. But PolitiFact Ohio thought we first should make sure Batchelder’s figures for the last two years are accurate. If he is correct, the number of House sessions convened in 2009 and 2010 will be the lowest two-year total in recent years. The House had 78 sessions in 2005-06 and 71 sessions in 2007-08, according to the House clerk’s office. The House speaker publishes a schedule of planned sessions every six months. The speaker, under the rules of the House, also has the authority to cancel or add session dates as necessary. Budish, a Democrat from Beachwood, became House speaker at the beginning of 2009, after the Democrats took control of the Ohio House in the 2008 election. In 2009, Budish scheduled 74 session days and cancelled 43 times, leaving 31 days the House actually held session, according to figures provided by Batchelder and confirmed by Budish’s office. Batchelder and Budish also agree on figures for this year. Through Nov. 5, Budish had scheduled 35 session days and actually held session 17 times, according to their offices. The sum of those figures aligns closely with Batchelder’s statement to the newspaper. The number of scheduled session days is a match at 109. He is off by one on the number of actual sessions held. He said 49 but his office now agrees that 48 sessions were held in the last two years. Batchelder was counting a day the legislature met – but did not hold session – on the day of the governor’s State of the State address. While Budish’s office agrees with Batchelder’s numbers, it has a different interpretation of their meaning. Budish spokesman Keary McCarthy said the number of canceled sessions is not an indication that the House has malfunctioned in the past two years. He mentioned passage of a two-year state budget and work on legislation to help create jobs. McCarthy can disagree with Batchelder’s attack on the House’s productivity under Budish’s leadership, but he can’t really quibble with the number of canceled sessions Batchelder claimed. He was off by one in his total of actual sessions, but that miscalculation was insignificant. We rate Batchelder's claim as True. Comment on this item.	None	William G.

pomt-05648	"Did you know ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected -- $1.8 TRILLION?"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/21/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-health-reforms-price-tag-has-doubled/	U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, tweeted a claim that’s been racing through Republican circles in response to updated cost projections of the national health reform law. "Did you know ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected - $1.8 TRILLION?" Cruz tweeted March 19, 2012. Other politicians have been making similar claims since the Congressional Budget Office released a new report March 13, 2012, about the law’s expected costs. Fox News also ran a story saying the health law will cost twice as much as originally estimated. A close read of the report indicates that cost projections have increased -- but have not nearly doubled. The health care law, passed in 2010, helps individuals obtain health coverage by expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies for moderate-income Americans to purchase insurance. In 2010, the CBO analyzed cost projections, which go up over time as more provisions of the law are implemented. In that report, the gross cost to the government for coverage was projected at $938 billion. That figure -- again, the gross cost -- didn’t take into account revenue offsets, such as new taxes on the wealthy and penalties paid by individuals and employers who don’t opt into insurance. Those payments bring down the law’s net cost. The CBO’s latest report updates those figures, but it looks at different years. The new gross estimate is $1.762 trillion -- the figure cited in Cruz’s tweet. But it looks at costs over 11 years -- 2012-2022 -- whereas the earlier report’s figure was for 10 years. And it’s important to note that the timespan of 2012 through 2022 covers nine years when the law is fully implemented (and thus its costs are greater). So, when we compare the years encompassed in both reports (2012 through 2019), here’s how that apples-to-apples comparison shakes out. In the CBO’s first estimate, the gross figure is $931 billion. In the new estimate, the figure is $1.01 trillion. That’s an increase of 8.6 percent -- far short of Cruz's claim that it is "nearly twice as much." Ezra Klein pointed out in the Washington Post’s Wonkblog that the cost went up "because the recession has made people poorer, and so the health-care law is going to have to spend more to help them get health insurance." Finally, when comparing net figures from the CBO -- which certainly provide a more true-to-life picture of the law’s cost than gross numbers -- the projection for those eight years is actually less. The CBO estimated it at $784 billion in 2010 and revised that to $768 billion in 2012. Cruz's spokesman responded to our inquiry by suggesting that the CBO's original cost projection was misleadingly low because it covered years before the law was fully implemented. "Even the new CBO score includes two years before the law goes into full effect, so the eventual CBO score for the first 10 years of full implementation will be far higher than the new $1.76 trillion cost-of-coverage in the latest CBO score," spokesman James Bernsen wrote. But that also ignores the revenue that will be coming in from taxes and penalties, which drive the overall cost down. Cruz’s tweet saying that the cost of health reform has nearly doubled does not reflect an accurate comparison of dollars or years. When the CBO’s early projections are held up to new projections accurately, the gross cost increase is 8.6 percent. Cruz was a long way off. We rate his claim False. Editor's note: When our story first published, we hadn't heard back from Cruz's campaign. A short time later, we received an email from his spokesman and we updated the story to include his response.

pomt-14043	"I'm also the only lieutenant governor to not take a security detail."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/may/26/carlos-lopez-cantera/carlos-lopez-cantera-says-he-only-florida-lieutena/	Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera rolls without a security detail, a fact he likes to bring up as he campaigns to replace U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. It’s an example of penny-pinching that he uses to set himself apart from the field of five Republicans vying for Rubio’s seat, as well as some predecessors who drew scrutiny over transportation spending. "I've actually cut the budget of the office by more than half, reduced the staff," he said in an interview with Fox 13’s Money, Power, Politics show in Tampa which ran on air April 30. "I'm also the only lieutenant governor to not ever take a security detail." Lopez-Cantera had dropped this tidbit at a speech earlier that month with the Hillsborough County GOP, explaining, "It’s a waste of your money, and I’m protected by the Second Amendment." (He has a concealed weapons permit.) With Lopez-Cantera playing up this factoid as an accomplishment, we wanted to know if he was really the first No. 2 guy to say "nah, I’ve got this," to taxpayer-paid protection. How he declined his security detail According to state law, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles shall assign one patrol officer to the Office of the Governor — it does not mention the lieutenant governor. In practice, the right to a security detail for protection and transportation has been extended to recent lieutenant governors. But after Gov. Rick Scott plucked him for the office in 2014, Lopez-Cantera verbally declined that protection. In March, the Legislature approved a budget that added some language to state that the security patrol is at "the discretion of the Lieutenant Governor." It seems that Lopez-Cantera had that discretion anyway, but the new language in law makes that clear. The Legislature also added language to give the right to security for the attorney general, chief financial officer and agriculture commissioner. That appears to stem from a "credible threat" on Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2015, which prompted law enforcement to provide around-the-clock security for her for six weeks at a cost of $216,000. Scott’s press office re-emphasized that it was Lopez-Cantera’s choice — and not, as rumor had it, the decision of former Scott chief of staff Adam Hollingsworth to downplay the role — in response to our inquiry. Still, there appeared to be a push to reduce expenses in that position after multiple news reports cited the amount of money spent on security and travel for Jeff Kottkamp under Gov. Charlie Crist and Jennifer Carroll, Scott’s first lieutenant governor. The state spent $1.1 million over four years for security and transportation for Kottkamp. In Carroll's first year in office, the Florida Highway Patrol spent $288,000 on travel and security. But after spending restrictions were put in place, that total dropped to $89,000 in 2012. Lopez-Cantera garners even less attention as lieutenant governor than Carroll, hardly ever appearing alongside Scott at public events and keeping a sparse public calendar of events, the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times Tallahassee bureau noted in July 2015. Lopez-Cantera had six days of security — at a cost of $27,000 — in May 2014 following a threat against him, according to a Florida Department of Law Enforcement report. Past lieutenant governors and security The lieutenant governor role was revived in 1968 after a century without one. We tried to contact Lopez-Cantera’s predecessors (who are still alive today) for the low-down. The Florida Highway Patrol said that the following lieutenant governors had a security detail: Wayne Mixson (1979-87), Bobby Brantley (1987-1991), Buddy MacKay (1991-1998), Frank Brogan (1999-2003), Toni Jennings (2003-07), Kottkamp (2007-11) and Carroll (2011-13.) We attempted to reach all of those former lieutenant governors and were able to interview all but Brogan, Jennings and MacKay. Four confirmed they used the security detail. The only one who said he didn’t use a security detail was Jim Williams, who was the lieutenant governor 1975-79. "I didn’t have security," Williams, 93, told PolitiFact Florida. Anita Oneida Darley, his aide at the time, also said he didn’t have a security detail. The Florida Highway Patrol could not confirm. Mixson said that he used a security detail when he traveled within Florida, but he did not when he was in the office or when he traveled to foreign countries. "The Florida Highway Patrol had traditionally supplied a security individual and they did," Mixson said. Brantley said he had a state trooper who traveled with him sometimes, including on a trip to Canada. He said the trooper served mostly as a driver. "He had a desk inside my office," Brantley said. "If I didn’t have a need for him I’d have him go and do patrol duty. He would actually go on the street and stop speeders." Brantley said that Brogan was the first one he recalled with "an actual plainclothes security detailing talking in their sleeve and all that stuff." Kottkamp, now a lawyer in Tallahassee, said the security detail "came with the job." "On the night Gov. Crist and I were elected — they showed up at the hotel," he said. "Someone was with me and the governor from that point on. It was a responsibility the FHP took very seriously. FHP leadership viewed it as a legal obligation to insure continuity of government." Carroll said troopers would pick her up to provide security when she traveled to other parts of the state. Our ruling Lopez-Cantera said, "I'm also the only lieutenant governor to not take a security detail." He went without a security detail when he started in 2014 — a break from most lieutenant governors in recent memory who have used state security. The only one we could find who said he did not have security detail was Jim Williams, lieutenant governor from 1975-79. The state could not confirm one way or another. That was about 40 years ago, so to us Lopez-Cantera’s point still holds water. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f3425ea7-664c-4d1c-9bc5-bb771765d290	None	Carlos Lopez-Cantera	None	None	None	2016-05-26T15:53:24	2016-04-30	['None']

pomt-12889	Says Betsy DeVos and her family "have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo 'conversion' therapy."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/25/mark-pocan/betsy-devos-backs-groups-say-lgbt-students-must-ge/	An openly gay congressman has injected conversion therapy -- which aims to use counseling and often religious teaching to convert someone who is homosexual -- into the debate over President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of education. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Madison-area Democrat who has called for prohibiting the use of such therapy on minors, attacked Betsy DeVos in a letter on Jan. 11, 2017, six days before her Senate confirmation hearing. The letter, signed by Pocan and the other four co-chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, was sent to the leaders of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which is scheduled to vote on DeVos’ nomination on Jan. 31, 2017. The letter said DeVos, an education activist and a major Republican donor from Michigan, has tried to undermine the rights of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. And it included a claim about conversion therapy and students, saying of DeVos: She and her family have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo "conversion" therapy and have also affiliated with groups that oppose anti-bullying legislation. The next secretary of education must represent all students in our country. Anyone who promotes such fervently anti-LGBT viewpoints is wholly unqualified to serve as the secretary of education. So, Pocan is charging that DeVos and her family "have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo 'conversion' therapy." More on DeVos, conversion therapy DeVos, whose wealth is estimated by Bloomberg at $130 million, is the daughter-in-law of billionaire Richard DeVos, the co-founder of Amway. She was part of a previous Pocan claim, that Trump's Cabinet appointments have a net worth of "more than a third of America." Our rating was Mostly True. One-third of American households have a combined net worth of roughly zero. So, the combined net worth of Trump Cabinet members is greater, though so is that of any American who has a net worth of more than zero. At DeVos’ confirmation hearing, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., accused DeVos of giving $25,000 to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which has lobbied for more rights for college students accused of sexual assault. PolitiFact Pennsylvania rated the claim Mostly True. DeVos was also asked about her family donating to groups that push conversion therapy. She disputed the characterization of her family’s donations and, though Pocan’s claim doesn’t refer to her personal position on conversion therapy, DeVos said she has "never believed in that." Conversion therapy -- also known as reparative therapy and sexual orientation change effort -- is supported by some Christian groups, such as Focus on the Family, which says it should be available for people who have "unwanted homosexual attractions." A number of medical groups warn of its dangers and at least two of them -- the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians -- outright oppose it. The association says the risks include depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior. (U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., announced Jan. 23, 2017 that she will oppose DeVos’ nomination. Baldwin, who is also openly gay, did not mention gay rights in her announcement.) Money part of Pocan’s claim To back Pocan’s claim, his office cited two groups: Focus on the Family and the Traditional Values Coalition. Let’s start with the "donated extensively" part of the claim. The office cited reports from two interest groups on Colorado-based Focus on the Family, which was founded by James Dobson, an evangelical Christian. One says says the DeVos family has given more than $6.7 million to Focus on the Family and the other says DeVos and her husband, Dick, have given $275,000 to the group. We found a comparable figure by checking federal tax records. They show that from 2003 to 2015, the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation of Holland, Mich., gave $5.7 million to Focus on the Family. DeVos was listed as the foundation’s vice president, though at her Senate confirmation hearing, she said that was a "clerical error." In contrast, Pocan’s office did not cite any reports on DeVos giving to the Traditional Values Coalition, a California-based conservative religious activist group. And we found nothing in tax records to indicate DeVos contributions to the coalition. (Two web articles say the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation has given money to the Traditional Values Coalition. But the article appears to mix up the coalition with the Michigan-based Foundation for Traditional Values, which the DeVos foundation has supported.) Conversion therapy part of the claim As for the second part of Pocan’s claim, we found indications that both groups cited by the congressman support conversion therapy. But no evidence that they believe that students who identify as LGBT must undergo it. And a spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such groups, said the center is not aware of either group making such a statement. Focus on the Family has issued statements in support of people changing their orientation, including this one from June 2013: God’s help usually doesn’t come as a fast fix. It’s often a long process. Many times it takes counseling, Bible study, prayer and community support  —  but it can be done. Here at Focus we’ve seen marriages reconciled. We’ve seen people who struggle with unwanted same-sex attraction change. We’ve seen people experience real transformation in their thoughts, behaviors, attractions and identity. The group also maintains a web page entitled "Leaving Homosexuality." One section notes there is opposition to conversion therapy, but states "there is a great deal of evidence that also shows that people have been helped" by such therapy. It says "individuals should have the availability of professional therapy options for unwanted homosexual attractions and behavior." A Focus on the Family spokesman told us that "many individuals -- including students -- with same sex-attractions find those feelings to be in conflict with their faith and Focus on the Family strongly supports their right to seek help from licensed mental health professionals as they work to resolve this conflict and steward their sexuality according to their religious beliefs." The evidence is less clear for the Traditional Values Coalition, which hosted a "Christian Inaugural Gala" as part of Trump’s inauguration. The Los Angeles Times reported on a conversion therapy conference that was led by evangelist Louis P. Sheldon, the coalition’s founder. But the conference was in 1990, the article didn’t mention students and we didn’t find any more recent statements from the coalition about conversion therapy. To be sure, the coalition is not viewed as friendly to gay people. Its website says military chaplains are being prevented "from speaking out in any way against homosexuality." And in 2015, the coalition filed a lawsuit, which was dismissed, seeking to block the Fairfax County School Board in Virginia from implementing protections the board put in place for gay and transgender students. Our rating Pocan says DeVos and her family "have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo 'conversion' therapy." A family foundation that listed DeVos as the vice president has given millions of dollars over more than a decade to one of two groups cited by Pocan, Focus on the Family. But we couldn’t find evidence of donations to the Traditional Values Coalition. And although there are indications that both groups support conversion therapy, we didn’t find evidence that they promote the idea that students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender must undergo it.

pomt-13774	"Every single strawberry that is served to Members of Congress will have passed through the rough hands of an undocumented immigrant."	half-true	/illinois/statements/2016/jul/21/luis-gutierrez/do-all-strawberries-consumed-congress-pass-through/	When Republican nominee Donald Trump met with GOP congressional leadership in May, U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill, took to the House floor to denounce Trump and his plans to deport illegal immigrants. Gutiérrez followed up with a tweet to his followers reading, "Every single strawberry that is served to Members of Congress will have passed through the rough hands of an undocumented immigrant." That statement caught our attention. Could such an expansive claim be verified? We decided to look into it. Farm worker demographics A Gutiérrez staff member told PolitiFact that the tweet was a quote from the speech delivered that same day. In the speech, Gutiérrez said, "Whether it was growing them, picking them, packing them, shipping them, unloading them, or some other part of the process, Strawberry Festival Month really means undocumented farmworker month." Based on various surveys and studies done over the years, it is safe to say that much agricultural work in the United States is dependent on undocumented workers. A report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service found that "over the past 15 years, about half of the hired workers employed in U.S. crop agriculture were unauthorized, with the overwhelming majority of these workers coming from Mexico." Some representatives of farm workers say that estimate may even be on the low side. "Undocumented farmworkers may not feel comfortable answering this question accurately when responding to a government study," said Giev Kashkooli, political director of the United Farm Workers of America. Furthermore, many workers "may choose not to participate in the survey due to fear of responding to a government study." What about the strawberry industry, specifically? Gutiérrez’s statement was in direct reference to strawberries, so we wanted to know how strawberry farm workers compare to the larger agriculture industry. Another U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service publication cites a report by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2005-09 which shows that 67 percent of fruit and nut hired workers do not have work authorization in the United States, compared to the overall figure of 50 percent. Furthermore, if you consider just new entrants in the fruit and nut industries, those first working on a farm for less than two years, the percentage without authorization is 97 percent, which is 25 points higher than the overall figure for new entrants. Kashkooli and the United Farm Workers of America also shared that the number of H2A (the documented and legal guestworker program) workers in the berry industry is much lower than other agriculture industries. California has a higher rate of undocumented workers than other states, which may further suggest a higher rate of undocumented workers in the strawberry industry since California accounts for over 88 percent of total U.S. strawberry production according to the California Strawberry Commission. Florida has the second-largest strawberry industry in the United States, producing between 10 and 15 percent of the national supply. The Department of Labor directed us to the Florida Strawberry Growers Association for information regarding the status of the state’s strawberry workers. We did not receive a reply from our inquiry. Generally, the berry industry attracts more undocumented workers due to the grueling nature of the work. The necessity of hand-picking each individual berry prompts many to look for work in other industries. It is important to note that not all strawberries consumed in the United States are produced in the United States. According to the USDA’s most recent data, in 2012, if U.S. strawberry exports were subtracted from the total number of strawberries produced in the United States, 2.66 billion pounds of strawberries were consumed in the U.S. market. The United States imported about 566.4 million pounds of strawberries in that same year. So, in terms of percentage, approximately 21.2 percent of strawberries consumed in the United States were imported from other countries, mostly from Mexico. Since over one-fifth of strawberries are not produced in the United States, Gutiérrez’s claim has less viability. Our ruling Gutiérrez stated to the House that, "Every single strawberry that is served to Members of Congress will have passed through the rough hands of an undocumented immigrant." The evidence says that about 50 to 70 percent of farm workers in the United States are undocumented. While most data and experts agree that the figure is higher for the strawberry industry, there is no clear way to deduce a solid estimate that would back Gutiérrez’s claim. Since PolitiFact puts the burden of proof on the speaker, we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2059ed26-3749-45dd-ac36-0fe1001bcc54	None	Luis Gutierrez	None	None	None	2016-07-21T21:59:57	2016-05-12	['None']
pomt-09999	"2008 was the deadliest year of the war (in Afghanistan) for American forces."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/31/barack-obama/Conditions-in-Afghanistan-have-deteriorated/	Long since eclipsed by Iraq, the Afghan conflict, known to the military as Operation Enduring Freedom, has often been relegated to the back pages of the newspaper. Even as it has faded from view, however, the war has grown ever deadlier, President Barack Obama said in a speech to government officials and military officers at the White House on March 27, 2009. "It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan," Obama said, announcing the deployment of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan. "Attacks against our troops, our NATO allies, and the Afghan government have risen steadily. And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces." We wondered if that was true and checked the latest Pentagon statistics . Indeed, U.S. military deaths numbered 155 in 2008, which is the highest since the war began in 2001. The number of U.S. deaths has increased almost every year, with two exceptions. The year-to-year fatality count, from 2001 to 2008, is: 11, 48, 45, 52, 98, 98, 117, 155. In the first two months of 2009, there were 30 U.S. military deaths, putting this year on pace to be the deadliest yet. We looked for any indication that this statistic was unrepresentative of the conditions in Afghanistan. Quite the contrary — it is one of several measures by which the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. The number of U.S. military personnel wounded in action has also increased every year, from 33 in 2001 to 790 in 2008, totaling 2,713. Military deaths of personnel from the 21 other outside countries involved in the conflict have increased every year since 2004, to a peak so far of 139 in 2008 (and 2009 is on pace to surpass that). Afghan civilian casualties hit a high mark too last year, with 2,118 civilians killed, up from 1,523 in 2007, according to the United Nations. In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in September, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Taliban and al-Qaida fighters are coordinating better from safe havens in Pakistan and launching "ever more sophisticated, even infantry-like attacks against fixed coalition positions." "I'm not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan," Mullen said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the committee Afghanistan was in some ways a more complex challenge than Iraq. "We don't have a single adversary," he said. "We have the Taliban, we have the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group, we have the Haqqani network, we have narco-thugs, we have al-Qaida, we have foreign fighters." So Obama's claim is not only technically correct, but also accurately reflects the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan. We find his claim to be True.

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton argued about Obama's recent comments about Ronald Reagan (We addressed the Reagan spat with this item ). As the debate grew heated, Obama portrayed himself as a fighter for Democratic principles and suggested that he was more in touch with working people than she was. "While I was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas, you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart," Obama said. Obama is referring to the period from 1985 to 1988 when he was a community organizer in neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side. And he is correct that during that period, many employers in that area — particularly in the steel industry — were closing their plants and moving jobs overseas. U.S. Steel, for example, employed 40,000 people there in the 1970s but shut down operations in the mid 1980s. Obama is correct about Clinton's tenure on the Wal-Mart board of directors. She was appointed to the board in 1986 when her husband was the governor of Arkansas and she served until 1992. As a board member, Clinton pushed for more women in management and a better environmental program, according to a New York Times examination of her work on the board. At the time, she worked as an attorney for the Rose Law Firm, which had many corporate clients such as Wal-Mart and Tyson Foods. Clinton specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property cases. We find Obama has his facts straight and his claim is True.

pomt-04421	Says economists Harvey Rosen and Martin Feldstein have said that "paying for (Mitt) Romney’s tax cuts would require large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-princeton-economists-analysis-do/	The debate about Mitt Romney's tax plan has centered on its lack of specifics. The Tax Policy Center has said Romney hasn't offered enough cuts or revenue to pay for his tax reductions. But Romney has said reports by economists show the plan will add up. Two of the reports Romney touted to support his view were by Harvey Rosen, a Princeton University economist who served as chairman of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, and by Martin Feldstein, a Harvard University economist and former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. In an email to supporters, President Barack Obama tried to turn the tables by using their work to contradict Romney. "Even the studies that Romney has cited to claim his plan adds up still show he would need to raise middle-class taxes," the Obama campaign said. "In fact, Harvard economist Martin Feldstein and Princeton economist Harvey Rosen both concede that paying for Romney’s tax cuts would require large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000." Really? The experts cited by Romney actually agree with Obama? We decided to explore whether Obama was right. We read both economists' writings and didn't see any such claims. In fact, after the Obama campaign sent its email, Rosen told the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, that the Obama campaign was twisting what he said. We won’t try to determine whether Rosen or Feldstein are right with their analysis, though we have previously written that their study is not as detailed as the Tax Policy Center analysis. However, in this item, we have a more limited mission -- to see whether the Obama campaign has accurately characterized their findings. Rosen’s study As we noted in a previous item, Rosen’s paper used 2009 data to analyze what happens under Romney's plan. Rosen found that when a wide array of tax breaks are eliminated -- from home mortgages to charitable giving to health insurance benefits -- and projected economic growth rates are factored in that the increased revenues can balance out the money lost through tax rate cuts for high-income taxpayers. Rosen looked at several scenarios and found that most of them enabled Romney to keep his promises. But Rosen found one in which he the numbers fell short of balance by $28 billion. He wrote that Romney’s ability to stick to each of his promises in this scenario "would be more challenging," but not "mathematically impossible." Rosen told us that when he used the term "more challenging," he was "referring to identifying other tax preferences that haven’t received much attention in the debate so far. For example, currently, capital gains on assets that are bequeathed to heirs when an individual dies are not subject to tax. This is clearly a tax preference that benefits primarily upper income individuals, so scaling it back would also help fill the gap." When we contacted the Obama campaign, they pointed us to a Bloomberg article that quoted Rosen. "Mitt Romney says he can lower income-tax rates by 20 percent without costing the U.S. government revenue and without making the middle class carry a bigger share of the tax load," the article said. "He’s right -- assuming that Congress eliminates the most widely used deductions by taxpayers earning more than $100,000 a year, says Harvey Rosen, an economics professor at Princeton University whose study Romney cites as evidence that his plan is viable. … ‘What the political system would find feasible, I don’t know,’ Rosen says. ‘It’s mathematically possible.’" Rosen told PolitiFact that the view attributed to him in the Bloomberg article isn’t inconsistent with what he wrote in his paper. "All the Obama campaign is really saying is that tax reform is hard," Rosen said. "Well, that’s true -- but it’s also totally obvious. If that’s all the Tax Policy Center had claimed, then I would never have bothered to write my paper. The Tax Policy Center went way beyond that when it claimed that the Romney proposal is ‘mathematically impossible.’ That sounds a lot cooler than ‘politically difficult,’ but as my paper argues, under plausible assumptions, ‘mathematically impossible’ is not correct." Feldstein’s study Meanwhile, Feldstein, a Romney adviser, used 2009 data from the IRS to demonstrate that Romney can meet all his goals and not increase taxes on the middle class. "Mitt Romney's plan to cut taxes and offset the resulting revenue loss by limiting tax breaks has been attacked as ‘mathematically impossible,’" Feldstein wrote. Romney’s plan, "say critics, would require a large tax increase on the middle-class to avoid raising the deficit. Careful analysis shows this is not the case." In an interview with PolitiFact, Feldstein noted that his analysis didn’t separate out data for earners between $100,000 and $200,000. That means the Obama campaign is incorrect to say Feldstein argues that "large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000" would be needed. Feldstein’s data doesn’t address that income range. "I did the analysis treating the middle-class families as those below the top 20 percent -- those below $100,000," Feldstein said. "I didn't calculate the average tax increase for those in the $100,000 to $200,000. So I cannot say that (the Obama campaign is) right or wrong about the $100,000 to $200,000 families. But I think it is fair to say that those with incomes in the top 20 percent of the distribution are relatively affluent and should not be counted as the middle class." Our ruling The Obama email claimed that Rosen and Feldstein have said that "paying for (Mitt) Romney’s tax cuts would require large tax increases on families making between $100,000 and $200,000." But Feldstein’s analysis didn’t look at the income range the Obama campaign said it did, and in Rosen’s case, the Obama campaign has overplayed its hand. At the very least, Rosen’s work could be interpreted as saying that tax increases on middle-income voters could be needed -- not would be needed -- and Rosen never characterized any such increases as "large." Either way, both economists’ analyses include clearly worded passages that disagree with the Obama campaign’s claim that middle-class tax increases would be "required" under a Romney plan. We rate the Obama campaign’s claim Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-15T11:30:34	2012-10-07	['Mitt_Romney']
pomt-07396	Republicans offered Wisconsin bar patrons "free shots (of alcohol) to sign recall petitions against" Democrats.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/01/chris-larson/wisconsin-sen-chris-larson-says-republicans-offere/	In the spring of Wisconsin’s discontent, voters launched recall campaigns against 16 state senators. That’s every state lawmaker who was eligible to be recalled -- and four times the number who have been forced into such elections in the 85 years that Wisconsin state officers could be recalled. The recalls followed the collective bargaining-curbing budget-repair bil introduced by Republican Gov. Scott Walker in February 2011. Formal recall campaigns targeted eight of the 14 Democratic senators who fled to Illinois for three weeks in an attempt to prevent a vote on Walker’s bill; and eight GOP senators, all of whom voted for the bill, which became law but is tied up in court. So far, the campaigns against three Democrats failed to collect enough signatures; efforts targeting the other 13 lawmakers are pending. On April 22, 2011, first-term state Sen. Chris Larson, a Milwaukee Democrat, stirred the pot with an Internet comment about the still-active recall campaign against Kenosha Democrat Robert Wirch, a 19-year state lawmaker. "In case you missed it," Larson tweeted, "Republicans offered free shots to sign recall petitions against Dems." That’s shots, as in shots of alcohol, and "Dems" as in Democrats. Let’s belly up to the bar and see if that’s what happened. Larson’s tweet linked to an article posted the same day on Alternet.org, a website that says it aims to "inspire action and advocacy on the environment, human rights and civil liberties, social justice, media, health care issues, and more." Larson stated flatly that Republicans offered the free shots, but the article hedged, saying, "Republicans apparently had to give out free shots of booze" to people to get them to sign petitions to recall Democratic state senators. So, the article itself does not fully back up Larson’s claim. The article refers readers to the previous night’s edition of the liberal "Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC. Maddow told how earlier that day, the liberal HuffingtonPost.com posted audio of a conversation she said documented a claim by Democrats that circulators of petitions to recall Democratic state senators "offered free shots of booze" to get people to sign the petitions. The audio accompanied an article by Huffington Post reporter Amanda Turkel that said a "Democratic source" provided the audio, as well as a draft of a complaint that the Wisconsin Democratic Party might file with the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections. The draft of the complaint, according to the article, was signed by a woman who was with friends on Feb. 27, 2011, at John’s Main Event in Burlington, a small city in southeastern Wisconsin. The article said the woman heard that someone in the restaurant was offering free shots to people who signed a recall petition against Wirch. The woman, the article continued, said a bartender showed her the recall petition and told her that if she signed it, she and her friends would get free shots. Here’s some of what’s in the roughly one minute of audio: A woman says, "OK, so you’re going to get us one, two, three, four, five shots if we sign this." A man replies, "That’s right. I’ll buy them." There’s a bit of chatting among a group of women about the recall petition, then the woman who spoke to the man says to her friends, amid some other chatter: "Because it’s bull-crap, what he did. Because it’s bull-crap that they went out of the state," she said, apparently referring to Wirch and the other Democratic senators who fled to Illinois. "That’s bull-crap. No, to recall him, to get him out of there for the bull-crap that he did." So, an article and an audio recording indicate someone of unknown party affiliation offered to buy shots of alcohol for a group of women, and perhaps other bar patrons, if they signed a recall petition against one Democrat. Asked if Larson had evidence beyond the article he linked to in his tweet, his staff cited the Huffington Post report along with a Wisconsin Radio Network report. The radio report, however, simply mentioned the allegation. When we talked to Larson, he acknowledged he had no evidence beyond media reports; said he was aware of only the one instance in which shots allegedly were offered; and said he assumed the offer he tweeted about would have been made by a Republican, given that Wirch is a Democrat. We also called Dan Hunt, chairman of Taxpayers to Recall Robert Wirch, who provided this account: On the day the Huffington Post article was posted, Hunt received a message through Facebook from a man who identified himself as the bartender. Hunt confirmed that the man was one of the volunteers who collected signatures to recall Wirch. The bartender said the conversation captured in the audio did occur and that the five women signed the petition, but that he ultimately did not buy them drinks. The bartender crossed out the five names before submitting the petition to the recall committee, which has submitted all of its petitions to the Government Accountability Board. Hunt said at least four of the signatures would not have been valid because they were listed with addresses that are not in Wirch’s district. Hunt added that the Wirch recall campaign does not condone offering alcohol in exchange for signing petitions, but he noted that the Government Accountability Board has said such a practice is not illegal. Board spokesman Reid Magney confirmed that offering a shot for a signature is not illegal. But he said, "We strongly discourage anyone from offering anything of value in exchange for a signature on a petition because it taints the process." Hunt refused to give us the name of the bartender, saying the bartender didn’t want to be interviewed. Hunt said he did pass along our interview request to the bartender. But the man didn’t respond to that, or to a phone message we left with an employee at John’s Main Event. Wirch didn’t call us back, either, and a spokesman for the state Democratic Party declined comment. OK, someone get us the tab. Larson claimed that Republicans offered free shots of alcohol to get people to sign recall petitions against Democrats, framing it in the broadest possible sense. Larson is correct that multiple free shots were offered. But the record so far shows they were offered by one person, whose party affiliation, if any, isn’t known. And the shots were offered for signatures against only one Democrat. Larson’s statement contains some element of truth, but wrongly suggests that the shots-for-signatures was more than an isolated incident. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14933	"For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/28/marco-rubio/rubio-says-more-businesses-are-closing-opening-fir/	Editor’s note, Oct. 30: After we published this fact-check, we learned that the Census Bureau had new data that showed firm births were greater than firm deaths in 2012 and 2013. We revised our rating from True to Half True and archived the earlier version here. In the third Republican presidential debate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio faced a question about his many missed votes in Congress. The CNBC moderator asked why he didn’t settle down and get more done before running for the Oval Office. Rubio basically said that the country didn’t have time to wait for him. "Watching this broadcast tonight, there are millions of people who are living paycheck to paycheck," Rubio said. "They’re working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more and they haven’t had a raise in decades. You have small businesses in America that are struggling. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting," he said. Rubio has talked about the birth and death of businesses before. It was accurate at one point, based on census data, and we rated the claim True in June 2015. We rated the statement True on debate night as well. An alert reader, however, contacted us to say the census has released more data than we considered in our original report. So we decided to check that out. The U.S. Census Bureau collects data on firm births and deaths as part of a project called Business Dynamics Statistics. The numbers go back to 1977. From that starting point until 2008 and the Great Recession, each year showed more new firms popping up than existing ones going away. In the three years from 2009 until 2011, the trend reversed. There were more deaths than births. The Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, produced a May 2014 report titled, "Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros." The authors used the Census Bureau’s data but at the time, the data they used only went through 2011. The most recent data now goes through 2013, and what’s most significant is that in 2012, the tide changed. That year, the country saw a net gain of about 36,000 firms and in 2013, a small but still positive increase of a bit over 5,000 new firms. We should note that the difference for 2013 is very small. This chart based on the Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics shows the ebb and flow. When the blue line is above the red one, firm births are greater than firm deaths. We contacted Ian Hathaway, one of the report co-authors. Hathaway confirmed the latest data and provided an updated spreadsheet. "We now have data for 2012 and 2013 and both show births exceeding deaths," Hathaway said. "Rubio's information is stale." This is not to say that firms are being born at anything close to the clip the country saw in past years. Between 1978 and 2007 (the recession began December 2007), an average of about 497,000 new firms appeared each year. The average for 2012 and 2013 is about 409,000. So the pace of growth is much slower, but the net figure may not be in the negative territory that Rubio described. The data for 2014 are 2015 is unavailable. It is worth noting that the number of firms closing has remained fairly stable. The average since 1978 is about 390,000 closing each year. In 2013, about 400,000 shut their doors. We reached out to the Rubio campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Rubio said that "for the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting." As recently as 2014, researchers came to that conclusion looking at Census Bureau data from 2009-11. That’s the information Rubio likely relied on in making his claim. But more up-to-date Census information says the trend has reversed and that in 2012 and 2013, more businesses started then closed. The balance is very tight in 2013 and we don’t have the numbers for 2014 or 2015. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-10-28T21:54:00	2015-10-28	['None']

pomt-00069	"A 97 year-old Holocaust survivor was killed for being Jewish yesterday. In the United States. Let that sink in."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/02/blog-posting/97-year-old-victim-synagogue-shooting-was-not-holo/	In the wake of the the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh that left 11 Jews dead, some Americans are grappling with how it could have happened here. "A 97 year-old Holocaust survivor was killed for being Jewish yesterday," a post that appeared on Instagram on Oct. 30 said. "In the United States, Let that sink in." It was also posted on Facebook on Oct. 28 and reshared more than 1,500 times on that platform. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s true that a 97-year-old was killed—but was she a Holocaust survivor? Only one of the people murdered was that age: Rose Mallinger, the eldest victim. She was among many older members of the synagogue who were killed, according to the New York Times. "Some, like Rose Mallinger … were alive while the Holocaust was devastating Jewish communities around Europe, the paper reported. "They were the steady anchors of a faithful community that had changed over the years but persisted as a source of devotion, camaraderie and memory." Profiles of Mallinger in publications including the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette don’t describe her as a Holocaust survivor. But other media did—and then retracted the information. Forward, a Jewish publication, corrected an Oct. 28 story about Mallinger on Oct. 30. "An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Rose Mallinger was a Holocaust survivor," the editor’s note says. People magazine also corrected a story that "incorrectly identified Rose Mallinger as a Holocaust survivor." Yahoo News reported on Oct. 29 that census records "appear to show she was the fourth of six children of Yiddish-speaking parents who had themselves arrived in the U.S. from Lithuania as children."

pomt-12861	"The Taliban went after and murdered" people identified in the Chelsea Manning leaks.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/01/john-mccain/mccain-says-taliban-murdered-people-because-chelse/	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., opposes former President Barack Obama’s decision to shorten Chelsea Manning’s prison sentence — in part, he says, because her decision to release a large cache of government documents to WikiLeaks resulted in unnecessary deaths. In 2013, a judge sentenced Manning, a private in the U.S. Army, to 35 years in prison, an unprecedentedly long sentence for a leak of government information, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In January 2017, Obama decided to commute her sentence. She will leave prison in May. In a Jan. 18, 2017, interview, Fox News Host Bill O’Reilly asked McCain for his reaction to Obama’s decision. McCain said he felt "sorrow for the families of those individuals who identified in these leaks in Afghanistan that the Taliban went after and murdered. And rage because this president is basically endorsing a proposal that allows someone to go free who is responsible for the needless deaths of those people who are allies." O’Reilly pushed back on McCain’s assertion that individuals identified in the leaks were killed by the Taliban. "I just wanted to know if it was specific leaks that came to you as a Senator which showed what WikiLeaks did with Manning's help killed people that were helping the U.S.A.," O’Reilly said. McCain replied: "Let me be specific. The information I received when I was there was that the Taliban went after these people. I assume, killed them." The interview left us still wondering if people were killed because their names appeared in the documents that Manning leaked, so we decided to put McCain’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. McCain spokeswoman Julie Tarallo said the Taliban has a history of retaliating against people who cooperate with United States forces. She pointed to a 2010 interview by British television station Channel 4 with a Taliban spokesman, who said the group would "punish" Afghan nationals working for the United States named in the WikiLeaks logs. "If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them," said the spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid. But we could find no evidence the Taliban acted on these threats. We scoured court documents, congressional hearing transcripts and media reports, and we found that the government has not named a single individual who was killed because he or she was named in the leaked files. Not in public record In 2010, Manning — then known as Bradley Manning — was an Army analyst in Iraq. She downloaded about 700,000 government files and gave many of them to WikiLeaks, who made the files public. The records included diplomatic cables, reports about the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and notably a video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in Baghdad that killed civilians. The government was concerned that the Taliban or other adversaries might retaliate against foreign nationals named in the documents because the individuals cooperated with the United States. However, officials have never pointed to an example of someone actually getting killed because of the leaks. The closest call came in August 2013, during the sentencing phase of Manning’s trial, when the government tried to make the case that Manning’s leaks caused harm. Robert Carr, a retired U.S. Army brigadier general who led an investigation into the leak, testified that he knew of "one individual that was killed" by the Taliban as a result of the leaks. However, Carr conceded that the person killed hadn’t actually been named in the documents Manning gave to WikiLeaks. As a result, the judge decided to strike that testimony from the record. Here’s the relevant exchange (from an unofficial transcript provided by the Freedom of the Press Foundation): Carr: "As a result of the Afghan logs, I only know of one individual that was killed. The individual was an Afghan national. The Afghan national had a relationship with the United States government and the Taliban came out publicly and said that they killed him as a result of him being associated with the information in these logs." Defense attorney Major Thomas Hurley: "Ma'am, we may object again as to relevance. General Carr is going to going to talk about how this person wasn't listed in the WikiLeaks disclosures. This individual's name wasn't listed among those names, among the hundreds of names he talked about." Judge Denise Lind: "Is this, what you're testifying to, tied to the information in the disclosures in any way?" Carr: "The Taliban killed him and tied him to the disclosures. We went back and searched for this individual's name in all of the disclosures. The name was not there. It was a terrorist act on behalf of the Taliban threatening all of the others out there. But the name of the individual that was killed was not in the disclosures." So the Taliban said they killed an individual because of the WikiLeaks logs, but the logs didn’t actually mention this individual. Carr said that he only knew of that example. In his closing argument at Manning’s sentencing trial, lead attorney for the government Ashden Fein only said the leaks put hundreds of people "at risk of injury, incarceration or death as a result of the release of their names." He didn’t argue that anyone actually died. We should note that part of Manning’s trial took place in a closed hearing in order to discuss classified information. So it’s possible that deaths caused directly by Manning’s leaks could have happened, and we can’t know unless that information was declassified. David Coombs, Manning’s lawyer, attended the classified hearings. He told us that the government didn’t present any evidence that showed individuals were killed as a direct result of the leaks. "That information was never brought out because it doesn’t exist," Coombs said, calling McCain’s claim "completely false." Fein, the lead attorney for the government on the case, declined to talk to us on the record. If not deaths, what damage did Manning’s leaks do to national security? The government has repeatedly said the main impact is a "chilling effect" — meaning foreign officials and citizens are less likely to speak and cooperate with American soldiers and diplomats. But Obama administration officials have indicated the leaks didn’t actually cause a lot of harm. "I’ve heard the impact of these releases on our foreign policy described as a meltdown, as a game-changer, and so on. I think those descriptions are fairly significantly overwrought," said former Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2010, adding later, "Is this embarrassing? Yes. Is it awkward? Yes. Consequences for U.S. foreign policy? I think fairly modest.’’ In a December 2010 interview on NBC, former Vice President Joe Biden said about WikiLeaks, "I don't think there's any substantive damage, no. Look, some of the cables that are coming out here and around the world are embarrassing." Our ruling McCain said, "The Taliban went after and murdered" people identified in the Chelsea Manning leaks. In the several years since WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of government documents leaked by Manning, the government has not publicly identified a single example of the Taliban killing someone because that person was named in the leaks. If someone had died as a result, it seems logical that the incident would have become public knowledge, either through Manning's trial or in media reports. At Manning’s sentencing trial, one Army witness said he knew the Taliban killed one person and blamed it on the WikiLeaks revelations. However, that person’s name doesn’t appear in the files, and the military has provided no additional information. We rate McCain’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-11078	Wisconsin is "49th in the country in internet speed."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/20/mike-mccabe/wisconsin-gubernatorial-candidate-mike-mccabe-says/	Is your internet really as slow as you think it is? Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mike McCabe claims Wisconsin ranks 49th in the country for internet speed. "How are we going to compete in a 21st century economy, and how are people gonna fully participate in modern American life if we’re 49th in the country for internet speed?" McCabe said in an April 18, 2018, edition of the NewsTalk podcast. McCabe is one 10 Democrats seeking to take on Gov. Scott Walker in the 2018 election. McCabe, a political activist, is running on a platform of "principle over party." While we were waiting for the latest cat video to buffer, we decided to check out his claim. A look at the numbers When asked for backup, McCabe pointed to a 2016 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article which cited a study that ranked Wisconsin as 49th for fixed broadband internet speed. Fixed broadband encompasses landlines, desktops and laptops -- basically everything except mobile connections. So, McCabe made a broad statement about internet speed, but cited data that looks at only part of the picture -- and ignores a major chunk of internet use. To be sure, the 2016 Speedtest ranking McCabe cited did rank Wisconsin 49th, with a speed of 28.59 megabits per second, when it comes to just broadband speed. But if you look just at mobile, Wisconsin ranked much higher, at 15th place. The study did not include an average of broadband and mobile, but more recent data from Akamai’s 2017 State of the Internet Report, issued in the first quarter of 2017, did combine data from both. That ranking placed Wisconsin 30th for average overall internet speed. We asked University of Wisconsin-Madison telecommunications professor emeritus Barry Orton about McCabe’s claim. He said all data on the subject is a bit fuzzy, but said Wisconsin traditionally does not do as well as other states in terms of average speed. "Traditionally, WI has been ranked very low compared to other states, primarily because there are so many rural areas in Wisconsin with almost no internet service," Orton said. Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg said Walker has done extensive work to boost and strengthen Wisconsin’s broadband system, including creating a $7.68 million dollar grant, the largest in state history, to support broadband expansion. According to Altenburg this grant will provide 1,600 business locations and 18,000 residential locations with high-speed internet. When we told McCabe what we found, he promised to adjust his claim in the future. He said his main point was that Wisconsin’s goal should be to have high-speed internet access everywhere. Our rating McCabe claimed that Wisconsin ranks 49th in internet speed. A 2016 ranking put Wisconsin at 49th-slowest for broadband internet speed -- that is, for land-based internet, but that only provides a partial picture. When mobile is factored in, the state ranks much higher, in the neighborhood of 30th place. We rate McCabe’s claim Half True.

pomt-04049	A Paul Ryan-Scott Walker (or Scott Walker-Paul Ryan) ticket for the White House in 2016 would be unconstitutional because both men live in Wisconsin.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/28/internet-commenters/commenters-say-ryan-walker-ticket-would-be-unconst/	When two high-profile Wisconsin pols -- 2012 vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan and Gov. Scott Walker -- made a highly precocious Politico.com list of possible 2016 Republican presidential candidates, some Internet commenters cheered. Others jeered. One political junkie’s Dream Ticket, it seems, is another’s Nightmare Express. But as the online reaction unfolded, we noticed another spin on things as commenters speculated on the two longtime friends being on the same ticket. It’s a legal impossibility, some argued. When Walker was to appear Jan. 21, 2013 on Greta Van Susteren’s "On the Record" show on FOX News, the commenter "4knit" called for a Ryan-Walker ticket when posting a comment on an item promoting that night’s appearance. A follow up post by "righteousva" dismissed the thought: "They couldn't carry Wisconsin for Romney in 2012; also not constitutional." Curious about the constitutional question, we surfed around a bit more … and found comments from late November 2012 speculating about an all-Florida ticket of former Gov. Jeb Bush and current U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. "Can’t happen unless one of them moves, "karenhasfreedom" wrote on HotAir.com. "I remember back in 2000, Cheney had to move to WY to qualify as the VP because of some obscure thing that the entire ticket can’t come from the same state." Very interesting. At this point, we paused -- ever so briefly -- to consider an admonition directed at the Journal Sentinel when Walker and Ryan surfaced on Politico’s watch list. "Hey JS … Can we give it a rest for a little while and enjoy the holidays," wrote "shadow1757" "No need to stoke the flames of political differences around the dinner table. Can we at least wait until inauguration day has passed to start speculation on the next POTUS race?" Well, inauguration day has passed. And, while we typically check statements by politicians, parties and pundits, we have also looked at claims from chain emails, Facebook posts and bloggers, even a billboard. So, why not take on a claim being circulated by a bunch of Internet commenters? So, on to 2016 and this question: Would a same-state ticket run afoul of the Constitution? We consulted several constitutional scholars, political scientists and experts on the Electoral College process and found there is a serious issue here that was a fascinating footnote in the razor-thin, controversial 2000 presidential race. And it could come into play again … in theory. In 2000, of course, with a boost from the U.S. Supreme Court decision ending the Florida recount, Republican George W. Bush topped Democrat Al Gore by five electoral votes even though he trailed in the popular vote. Just weeks before the Electoral College met, lawyers for three Texas voters challenged the Texas delegation’s right to cast its 32 electoral votes for Bush, the Texas governor, and his running mate, Dick Cheney. The lawsuit, which was dismissed in Texas courts before the electoral vote, claimed the U.S. Constitution’s 12th Amendment prohibited electors from voting for president and vice presidential candidates who live in the same state. Cheney had lived and worked in Texas, but an appeals court ruled his residence was Wyoming, where he had switched his voter registration and drivers license just before becoming Bush’s running mate, according to media accounts from the time. "Cheney tried to avoid the 12th Amendment issue by moving his voter registration and driver license from Texas to Wyoming in July, just before Bush announced him as his running mate," Cox News Service reported in January 2001. Here’s what’s behind the issue. Article Two of the U.S. Constitution says of the role of electors: "The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves." The 12th Amendment, approved in 1804, slightly altered the language (italics added): "The Electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves." That means electors from Wisconsin, for example, could not vote for both Ryan and Walker on a national ticket. That was the assessment of Judith Best of State University of New York-Cortland, Jack Rakove of Stanford University and Miriam Vincent of the Office of the Federal Register, which administers procedural aspects of Electoral College process. Electors cast separate votes for the two offices. The original rationale, Rakove explained, was that there would be a lot of "favorite son" voting among the electors, so that by requiring electors to cast one vote for someone who was not a resident of their own state, they would be forced to cast one vote on non-parochial (though not necessarily non-regional) grounds. However, that’s different than being prohibited from running on the same ticket. None of our experts said a same-state ticket would somehow be blocked from running, or that would be unconstitutional. To be sure, there could be negative consequences for such a ticket … at least on paper. "In the current case you imagine, only Wisconsin electors would be affected," Rakove wrote to us. "Presumably they would cast their votes for president for the Wis. candidate, and throw away their votes for vice president (I would bet for another Republican, rather than a Democrat)." Rakove said in the event that an electoral decision comes down to a handful of votes (like in 2000), the loss of the Wisconsin electors for the vice presidential candidate could prevent that candidate from getting a majority of electoral votes. In that event, the U.S. Senate chooses the veep. "It is still hard for me to imagine why senators from the other party would insist on voting for a v.p. from a different party than the president-elect," Rakove said in the email. We lured Vincent and Best deeper into our web of hypotheticals, asking if Wisconsin electors under such a scenario could split their allegiances. Yes, they said. For example, half could decide to support Walker for president and half could cast their presidential ballot for a non-Wisconsin resident. Under that scenario, the half that shunned Walker would be free to vote for Ryan for vice president. Of course, electors presumably would do this only if Walker had enough cushion in the electoral voting to win the presidency even without the full slate of votes from Wisconsin. The bottom line: A same-state ticket would pay a penalty in the presidential tally, the VP tally, or both. Which is why, among many other obvious strategic calculations, that same-state tickets are so unlikely to develop. Our rating Commenters on a hypothetical Ryan-Walker or Walker-Ryan ticket in 2016 claimed that such arrangements are unconstitutional. The constitution does exact a price for such arrangements, as electoral voters could only cast a ballot for one or the other candidate. But the claim that such tickets would be outlawed or blocked from running is off the mark. With a gentle nod to the commenters who probably never dreamed their musings would be fact-checked, we rate the claim False.

pomt-11703	On the Republican tax plan: "Unfortunately, the wealthy are, again, not going to do well in this bill"	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2017/dec/21/claudia-tenney/wealthy-would-do-well-under-tax-plan-contrary-tenn/	Rep. Claudia Tenney told a TV news station that the rich would not fare well under the Republican tax plan passed by the House last month. New York state’s highest earners would have paid more in taxes, said Tenney, a congresswoman from the Utica area. "Unfortunately, the wealthy are, again, not going to do well in this bill," Tenney said. "Unlike what you’re hearing from Chuck Schumer, he’s getting an awful lot of blowback from people down in New York City who are the highest earners in our state who are very upset because they’re actually going to pay more in taxes unlike what he’s claiming when he’s on the street." Congress passed a final tax bill this week. The new version is a combination of ideas from the House and Senate plans. Tenney was speaking about the House bill that lawmakers passed last month, according to her spokesperson. She was among the four Republican lawmakers from New York state to vote for it. The state’s five other Republicans opposed the bill. Tenney also voted to approve the final tax bill. We’re basing our fact check on what the House bill included at the time of her statement. Was Tenney right? Would the House bill have hurt the wealthy? Bad for the wealthy Experts said one provision included in both bills would disproportionately harm high-income earners: eliminating state and local tax deductions. The House bill capped the deduction for local property taxes at $10,000 while ending the deduction for state income and sales tax altogether. The final tax bill keeps all state and local tax deductions while maintaining the $10,000 cap. "That primarily affects people with really high incomes," said Len Burman, a co-founder of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. More than 90 percent of filers who make $200,000 or more deduct their state and local taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. For extremely wealthy people, the benefits they would have gotten from the tax bill outweigh what they would have lost by not being able to deduct a higher amount of state and local taxes, experts said. And the cap would be a bigger thorn in the side for wealthy people in New York state since they pay higher local and state taxes than those in other states. Tenney did not specify if she was talking about the wealthy in New York state or across the U.S. Her claim appears to be about the wealthy in the U.S. The information her office provided dealt with wealthy people overall in the U.S. -- not just New York state. If she was just talking about New York state's wealthy, experts said they, too, would still do well, but probably not as well as those in other states. Benefits for the wealthy All told, about 71 percent of those making more than $912,000 would have benefited from the House bill over the next decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. Similar research from the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning tax policy organization, found the top 1 percent of earners would have seen an increase in after-tax income of at least 3.3 percent by 2027 if the House bill became law. An analysis of the final tax bill by the Tax Policy Center found 75 percent of the top 1 percent of earners would get a tax cut in 2027. Unlike the House version, the final bill also lowers the top tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 37 percent. At no point would the majority of those earners have seen an increase in federal taxes because of the House bill, according to research from both groups. Among the provisions that give the wealthy a break: • The exemption for the estate tax -- a tax on one’s property after death but before it’s given to an heir -- would double to about $11 million in the House and Senate bills. That idea made it into the final tax bill. • The House bill also called for lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. The final bill puts it at 21 percent. • Wealthy earners also benefit from tax relief for pass-through companies, experts said. The House plan would have capped the tax rate on pass-through income at 25 percent, down from the current maximum of 39.6 percent. That change was not included in the final tax bill. Pass-through companies will instead be allowed to deduct up to 20 percent of their income. Our ruling Tenney said "the wealthy are, again, not going to do well in this bill." There can be many variables figured into each person's tax return. So generalizing the affects of a far-reaching tax bill can be tricky. But research shows that Tenney’s statement is wrong. Experts agree the wealthiest taxpayers would have come out ahead in the House tax plan. They may lose the deduction for state and local taxes, but research shows that loss is outweighed by other benefits. The final tax plan includes many of the same benefits for the wealthy as the House bill. We did not consider those for our ruling since Tenney was talking about the House bill.

pomt-01672	"I've been here almost every day."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/18/jay-nixon/missouri-governor-says-hes-been-ferguson-almost-ev/	Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon made the rounds on the Sunday political talk shows on Aug. 17 to discuss the ongoing turmoil in his state stemming from the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man shot and killed by a white St. Louis suburban police officer. In addition to discussing the reaction from the community and law enforcement agencies, Nixon was also grilled on his own response to the outcry. On This Week, Martha Raddatz told Nixon, "People are angry with you, personally. Your press briefings have been town halls, people venting their anger, wondering where you were early on. I know you issued statements after about 72 hours, but you didn't come to the scene for five days. What responsibility do you bear? Nixon replied: "Well, I mean, I've been here almost every day." We decided to review Nixon’s timeline for the last 9 days. Michael Brown was shot by police officer Darren Wilson around noon on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Mo., and was pronounced dead at the scene. Tension in the community built and reached a crescendo the evening of Aug. 10, when a vigil for Brown was overtaken by an angry protest and looting. We asked Nixon’s office to provide his schedule for the following days. Spokesman Scott Holste told us in an email, "The governor has made public appearances over there on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, or five of the seven days since the initial unrest a week ago Sunday night." While some details from those days were provided, his full schedule for the week was not. We pieced together Nixon’s schedule ourselves based on Holste's email, news reports, press releases from his office and his Twitter account, which often documents his travels. There were no tweets or releases about Ferguson on Aug. 10. There was one release from his office that day — an op-ed about mental health. On the morning of Aug. 11, after a night of chaotic protests and a standoff between the community and Ferguson police, Nixon formally requested for the Justice Department to independently investigate Brown’s death. One hour after tweeting out that release, Nixon’s account posted a picture of the governor addressing Missouri "conservationists and sportsmen." On Aug. 12, Nixon appeared at events for El Dorado Springs and Chadwick public school to announce funds to expand early childhood education. Later that day, he announced on Twitter that he was, "joining faith & civic leaders @ Christ the King United Church tonight in north St. Louis county #Ferguson." Nixon, along with the Ferguson police chief and mayor, spoke at a packed Christ the King United Church of Christ. He gave brief remarks to the standing-room crowd, about 465 words, according to a transcript posted on his official website. Here’s where things get technical. When questioning Nixon, Raddatz quizzed him on why he "didn't come to the scene for five days." The church event wasn’t held at the scene. Nor was it in the same locality. Instead, the church was about 4 miles from where Brown was shot in the bordering city of Florissant. At this point, Nixon had not visited the location where Brown was shot, and vigils and protests were being held all day and night. And he wouldn’t visit the scene or Ferguson until two days later, on Aug. 14. On Aug. 13, he toured a Joplin, Mo., high school re-opening three years after it was destroyed by a tornado and he later met with children from 4-H and Future Farmers of America. That night, Nixon announced that he was canceling plans to attend the Missouri State Fair on Aug. 14 and would instead go to Ferguson. "Closely monitoring situation & will be in North STL Co tomorrow. Ask for calm & urge law enforcement to respect rights of residents & press," his account tweeted. Every tweet sent from Aug. 14 through his appearances on the Sunday morning shows are related to Michael Brown and the Ferguson shooting. Beginning Aug. 14, Nixon also spent time each day in Ferguson. The morning he arrived he visited a local church and later a makeshift memorial, according to his Twitter feed. The next day Nixon had security briefings and held a press conference in Ferguson with Capt. Ron Johnson of the State Highway Patrol, whom Nixon tasked with keeping the peace there. On Aug. 16, he held a press conference to announce a curfew in front of a contentious crowd of demonstrators. As for why he delayed, Nixon told Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation that "these problems have to be solved at the local level," but he chose to take greater action "when I saw the military vehicles rolling up, when I saw guns pointed at kids." Nixon spoke with Schieffer and Raddatz from St. Louis on Aug. 17. Our ruling When Raddatz said Nixon hadn’t visited the scene of Brown’s death for five days, Nixon replied, "I've been here almost every day." Brown was shot Aug. 9 and violence broke out Aug. 10. Nixon first visited a nearby city on Aug. 12, but he didn’t visit Ferguson until Aug. 14. While Nixon was active early — calling for a federal investigation the morning after a standoff between protesters and police and attending the nearby community meeting — there is a distinct and noticeable shift in Nixon’s activities starting Aug. 14. Prior to that date, Nixon kept up his schedule and continued to make appearances unrelated to the Ferguson shooting. After that date, he held daily press conferences and meetings near the scene of the crime, visited the location of the shooting, and made no other official public appearances. In all, he was in Ferguson for three days from Aug. 10 through Aug. 16, all toward the end of the week. Given the evidence and the parameters of Raddatz’s question, Nixon’s statement is Mostly False.

pomt-02648	Scott Walker's income "tax plan is a tax hike. It increases taxes for nearly 80% of the people in the state."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/16/mary-burke/scott-walker-plans-end-income-tax-more-double-sale/	As her gubernatorial campaign was getting its sea legs, Mary Burke knocked Gov. Scott Walker for curtailing collective bargaining for most public employees, spurning federal money to expand Medicaid and failing to create jobs as quickly as he promised. With the turning of the calendar, Burke’s scope widened and her rhetoric sharpened. When WisPolitics asked her about the state income tax in a Jan. 7, 2014 interview, the Madison Democrat immediately invoked Walker, alleging he has a two-pronged plan that would raise taxes. "Walker's tax plan is a tax hike," Burke claimed. "It increases taxes for nearly 80 percent of the people in the state and we shouldn't think about it being anything other than a tax hike that falls on those who are least able to afford it. Eighty percent of the people in the state would pay more money." She added: "It's going to kill jobs. If you can imagine a hike from 5-1/2 to 13-1/2 percent in sales tax, every single business along any of our borders should be deeply concerned. People would leave and just drive across the border, buy their goods there. You think about a person who's thinking about buying a new car. That's an extra $1,000 or more on top of that price." Let’s slow down a bit. As Walker eyes the November 2014 gubernatorial election and a possible presidential run in 2016, he has said he is aims to continue cutting taxes. Yet, raising the state portion of the sales tax to 13.5 percent would make it the highest in the nation. So is Walker pushing a plan that would more than double the state sales tax, resulting in 80 percent of residents paying more in taxes overall? Income tax The income tax question to Burke followed comments Walker made about tax reform during at least four media interviews in December 2013 and January 2014. Let’s start with Walker’s comments, to see whether he has a plan to shift from the income tax to the sales tax. 1. In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Walker opened the door to a host of potential tax overhauls in his February 2015 state budget proposal (assuming he is re-elected). Those ranged from eliminating or flattening the income tax to dropping technical colleges from local property tax rolls. Walker said those changes could involve both outright cuts, and shifts of income or property taxes onto the sales tax. But he said he wouldn’t commit to any plan until after consulting with business leaders and the public. "I don't have any preconceived notion on this. It's not like I have one goal," the governor said. "The only goal is I want the overall tax burden to go down every year I'm in office. … What we're trying to do is have these early discussions that aren't threatening." 2. Asked by a Wausau TV station if it’s possible to eliminate the state income tax, Walker said his administration will ask residents "well into 2014" if they prefer to continue "chipping away" at various taxes or taking bold action. "If you look across the country -- some of the top performers, when it comes to job creation in the states -- are states that either have no income tax or very low income taxes," he said. "I’m intrigued by that; I think there’s a lot of merit to that. But what I want to hear back from taxpayers is, is that the right way to go?" Walker added: "As part of that -- a year out, spending the time really listening before acting -- is if we think removing income taxes entirely is the right way to go, how do we replace that? "We don’t have a specific plan on the table." 3. Walker made similar comments on Wisconsin Public Television, saying any formal plan to eliminate the state income tax, if one is developed, would not be proposed until late 2014 for the the 2015-'17 state budget. 4. And Walker told Wisconsin Public Radio that if the income tax were reduced or eliminated -- which he stressed is only an idea -- he would consider exemptions so that consumers wouldn’t have to pay sales taxes on essential goods such as clothing. "It would protect people who have the lowest incomes the most if you could carve out those basic essentials out there," Walker said. "And then, say, you want to spend more on things that may not be essential to your life and your livelihood, well then the sales tax is going to be a part of it." When we asked the Burke campaign to back Burke's claim, spokesman Joe Zepecki argued that "Walker is poised to pursue this policy change" given that he has been considering the elimination of the income tax for nearly a year. Zepecki cited comments made by one of Walker’s top aides, Secretary of Administration Mike Huebsch, in a news report in February 2013. Huebsch said at the time that raising the sales tax to about 13 percent would allow the state to eliminate the income tax, and that Walker was considering eliminating the income tax. But the news report said nothing of any plan. So, Walker has expressed interest in the idea of eliminating the income tax and acknowledged that such a move would require recovering at least some of that revenue by raising the state sales tax. But he has said repeatedly it’s a concept he wants to discuss with the public for at least a period of months before any plan is considered. And he has said it is important to "protect people who have the lowest incomes" if any change were to go forward. Burke, however, framed the issue as if there is a specific plan on the table to eliminate the income tax entirely, and then took it a step further by asserting that plan would more than double the sales tax. Sales tax The second part of Burke’s claim is that Walker’s plan would raise the state portion of the sales tax from 5.5 percent to 13.5 percent. Moreover, she says that would result in nearly 80 percent of residents paying higher net taxes. To be sure, there is no specific plan. But let’s dig a little deeper on the numbers. Burke cites a blog post from the Wisconsin Budget Project, a program of the liberal Wisconsin Council on Children and Families. The post says that raising the sales tax to 13.5 percent -- in order to recover all revenue lost by eliminating the income tax -- would mean the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers, in terms of income, would pay more net taxes. (The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau also says the state sales tax would have to go to nearly 13.5 percent in order to collect all revenue lost by eliminating the state's income tax.) For example, a taxpayer in the lowest 20 percent by income ($14,000) would pay nearly $750 more in taxes on average, according to the blog post. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent (average income exceeding $1 million) would receive a tax cut averaging nearly $44,000. The blog post ended by saying: "There’s a lot we don’t know yet about what the governor plans for the income tax. But one thing is clear: repealing the income tax would mean that all but the wealthiest taxpayers would be paying more in taxes, not less." The Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance notes that the wealthy pay disproportionately more of the state income tax and the poor spend more of their earnings than the wealthy do. That means high-income earners typically fare much better than the poor when the income tax is lowered and the sales tax is raised. So, mathematically speaking, revenue from the state income tax is equal to the revenue that would be collected by raising the state sales tax to roughly 13.5 percent. But Walker hasn’t proposed raising the sales tax to that level. And when he has talked about a shift in the state’s tax system, he has noted that exemptions on necessities such as food and clothing could be included to ease the impact of a higher sales tax on low-income residents. Beyond that, we can’t evaluate the fiscal impact of a plan that is not on the table -- yet that is precisely what Burke does in her claim. This claim reminds us of one we recently rated from Walker himself, in which the governor touted a tax relief bill by using a hypothetical scenario and cherry-picked numbers. We rated that claim Pants on Fire. Our rating Burke said Walker's income "tax plan is a tax hike. It increases taxes for nearly 80 percent of the people in the state." Walker wants to explore the possibility of eliminating the state income tax, which likely would trigger some increase in the state sales tax. But he has not advanced a plan to eliminate the income tax, nor to raise the sales tax by any particular amount. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, we give Burke a Pants on Fire.

pomt-14817	"59 percent of Americans today believe that Barack Obama is still a Muslim."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/nov/23/arsalan-iftikhar/do-59-percent-americans-believe-barack-obama-musli/	During a Meet the Press roundtable discussion about Americans’ attitudes about Muslims, a Muslim commentator said a majority of Americans think President Barack Obama is Muslim. "Let's not forget, 59 percent of Americans today believe that Barack Obama is still a Muslim," said Arsalan Iftikhar, an author, lawyer and commentator who blogs at TheMuslimGuy.com, on Nov. 22, 2015. "I feel like Jerry Seinfeld needs to pop on and say, ‘Not that there's anything wrong with that.’ " A reader asked us to check whether his statement was true, so we looked into the most recent polling data. We should note at the outset that Obama is not a Muslim; he is a Christian. A nondenominational Protestant, Obama has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He has also attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat. We should also note that segments of the public have long told pollsters that they think Obama is a Muslim. In 2010, a Pew Research Center survey found that 18 percent of Americans said that Obama is a Muslim. We found two polls in recent months that asked a question along these same lines: • CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Sept. 4-8, 2015. The pollsters asked, "Do you happen to know what religion Barack Obama is? Is he Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, Muslim, something else, or not religious?" Among all respondents, 29 percent said Obama is "Muslim." While that’s 11 percentage points higher than Pew had found five years earlier, it’s still not as high as the 59 percent figure Iftikhar cited on Meet the Press. The percentage was higher for Republicans alone -- 43 percent thought Obama is Muslim, compared with 15 percent of Democrats and 29 percent of independents. CNN/ORC surveyed 1,012 adult Americans by landline and cell phones, for a sampling margin of error of 3 percentage points. • Public Policy Polling poll, Aug. 28-30, 2015. The pollsters asked, "Do you think Barack Obama is a Christian or a Muslim, or are you not sure?" Public Policy Polling only asked "usual Republican primary voters" -- 572 of them -- this question. The automated survey was conducted by landline and the Internet, with a sampling margin of error of just over 4 percent. The survey found that 54 percent of the Republican primary electorate thought Obama is a Muslim, compared with just 14 percent who thought he is Christian and 32 percent who said they didn’t know. So with this survey, we reach a number within striking distance of Iftikhar’s Meet the Press statistic -- but it just describes the views of "usual Republican primary voters," which is only one subset of "Americans." When we reached out to Iftikhar, he quickly and good-naturedly copped to mangling his talking point. "You are correct," he wrote via email. "I did mean Republicans from the PPP poll. Nobody is perfect :-)" Our ruling Iftikhar said that "59 percent of Americans today believe that Barack Obama is still a Muslim." He later acknowledged to PolitiFact that he’d meant to say "Republicans" instead of "Americans," a switch that would have made his claim closer to accurate (though still a bit high according to recent polls). In any case, PolitiFact fact-checks statements as they were made originally and to the widest audience, so we rate the statement False.

Of those, it is correct that about 60,000 people had their referral declined (and another 10,000 were declined because their GP didn't provide enough information - they may well have re-applied and been accepted in a subsequent month). Of those who were declined, about 27,000 (46 percent) were turned down because they didn't meet the threshold - basically, the level of seriousness your condition has to reach before you can get a specialist appointment. The Ministry of Health defines this category as patients where "the referral is appropriate and the patient would benefit from an assessment but the referral is below the DHB's capacity threshold". So, those 27,000 people needed an appointment but missed out, because our health system couldn't afford it or couldn't cope with that demand. Another 29,000 (50 percent) were turned down because specialist services assessed their referrals and decided that a specialist appointment was "not required" - either because they didn't need an appointment, or their condition could be treated by a GP, or the appointment was unlikely to benefit them.

pomt-14130	Says Paul Ryan backs a proposal that would be a "bailout" of Puerto Rico.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/06/center-individual-freedom/legislation-backed-paul-ryan-help-debt-ridden-puer/	Wracked by a decade-long recession, Puerto Rico started borrowing, to cover budget shortfalls. Many Americans obliged, by buying Puerto Rican bonds, which are exempt from federal, state and local taxes in all 50 states. Now Puerto Rico is $72 billion in debt and defaulting on its debt payments. Don’t care much? Congress does. After all, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory; 3.5 million of the island’s residents are U.S. citizens. And now the word bailout is being thrown around. Puerto Rico’s debt problems Owes $72 billion -- nearly 100% of its annual economic output Defaulted on most of a $422 million in debt payment in May 2016 Owes a payment of nearly $2 billion due in July 2016 That B word is stated repeatedly by a political action committee in a new attack ad that claims House Speaker Paul Ryan and other U.S. leaders support a bailout. Ryan does back a bill for Puerto Rico that is sponsored by a fellow Wisconsin Republican, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy. But the bill is not what is commonly understood to be a bailout. That is, unlike American banks and automakers that got bailed out, Puerto Rico would not get any U.S. tax dollars. At the same time, the ad is careful to say the "bailout" would hurt "savers and seniors," not taxpayers. And Duffy’s bill, experts tell us, almost certainly would mean lower returns for perhaps hundreds of thousands of Americans who invested in what long had been regarded as safe Puerto Rican bonds. The ad The sponsor of the nationally televised ad is the Center for Individual Freedom, a conservative non-profit based outside of Washington, D.C. that does not disclose its donors. The center says its mission is to "protect and defend individual freedoms and individual rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution." Here’s a full description of the 30-second, narrated ad, which was unveiled April 13, 2016: Washington is trying to pull a fast one. The Obama administration and leaders in Congress want to bail out Puerto Rico. The words "Bail out Puerto Rico" appear on the screen over photos of Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi, President Barack Obama and Ryan. It's called Super Chapter 9. It grants Puerto Rico unprecedented bankruptcy protections. You pay for it. Pictures of older men and women appear on the screen. Retirement accounts crushed. A bailout on the backs of savers and seniors. Washington politicians try to claim otherwise. The photos of Pelosi, Obama and Ryan reappear. But we know a bad bailout when we see one. Don't be fooled. No Super 9 bailout of Puerto Rico. Duffy’s bill The Center for Individual Freedom didn’t respond to our call and emails asking for evidence to back its claim. But a news release from the group makes it clear the center is calling Duffy’s bill a bailout. The bill would establish a federal Oversight Board to assist Puerto Rico in managing its public finances. Ultimately, a judge would have the power to reduce the $72 billion in debt, according to the Washington Post. The experts we consulted agreed with Ryan, who has said the bill is not a taxpayer bailout of Puerto Rico, given that it would not commit any U.S. funds to the island. But the experts also agreed with U.S. Rep. John Fleming, R-La., a critic who has said the bill would function like a bailout because Congress would be "changing the rules" to benefit Puerto Rico. The rules would change under the bill in that Puerto Rico could restructure its debt, similar to what is done in a so-called Chapter 9 bankruptcy, and pay less to some creditors than the creditors are owed. In terms of the impact on American investors, many bond funds have already sold their Puerto Rican debt, and the debt is now mostly owned by hedge funds, according to the Associated Press. But Oppenheimer Funds and Franklin Templeton still own part of the debts. So, a restructuring almost certainly would mean that Americans who, through brokers or choices they made in their retirement accounts, put some of their savings into Puerto Rican bonds almost certainly will get a lower return on their money, the experts told us. But there is one more consideration, said Simon Johnson, a professor of global economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management: Americans who invested in Puerto Rican bonds thinking they were safe overestimated how safe they are, as the island’s debt crisis shows. With an Oversight Board managing a debt restructuring, savers likely will get a lower return than they expected. But without such a board, creditors would be fighting in court and the returns for individuals investors would likely be lower still. Our rating The Center for Individual Freedom, a Super PAC, says in a TV ad that Ryan backs a proposal that would be a "bailout" of Puerto Rico. The ad is misleading in its repeated use of the word bailout, in that legislation supported by Ryan -- unlike past bailout bills -- would not direct any U.S. tax dollars to the debt-ridden island. But the ad was careful to say the "bailout" would hurt "savers and seniors." And experts told us the bill almost certainly would result in lower returns for Americans who invested money in Puerto Rican bonds. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c527c9ab-63fa-4066-814e-9e36d1c87379 For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.

pomt-12603	"Afghanistan has more hectares (of opium poppies) planted today than they had before we started this war."	true	/global-news/statements/2017/apr/04/ted-yoho/yoho-afghanistan-poppy-growth-way/	President Donald Trump’s budget puts a number of foreign assistance programs at risk, if not outright elimination. His plan to cut about 30 percent from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development has drawn resistance from both Republicans and Democrats. At a March 28 hearing, Rep Ted Yoho, R-Fla., came to the defense of several prominent projects, including the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and two Obama-era programs aimed at boosting electric capacity in Africa and agriculture globally. But Yoho did agree with cuts in one area -- the war on drugs. He said it was ineffective. "I look at the poppy fields in Afghanistan," Yoho said. "They have more hectares planted today than they had before we started this war." Opium poppies produce a key ingredient for heroin and other opioids. Afghanistan remains the world’s top opium poppy producer, despite the billions of dollars America has put into the country. Since late 2001 when the United States and its allies retaliated against the Taliban and al-Qaida for the 9/11 attacks, America has spent about $25 billion to rebuild Afghanistan’s economy and $8.5 billion to rid it of narcotics. Yoho’s office said he got his information from a United Nations report. The latest survey found that in 2016, farmers were growing poppies on more than 200,000 hectares. In 2002, the number was 74,000 hectares. The U.N.’s chart below shows the pattern over the decades. The black lines show the high and low estimates. In conflict zones, satellite images replaced on-the-ground observations. Aside from a few years, the land under poppy cultivation has trended up. The actual tons produced has jumped around more, but it too is higher today than in 2002. The big drop in 2001 came after the Taliban banned production in 2000. The Taliban later reversed itself, leading to a rapid spread after 2012. According to the U.N., most of the opium comes from Afghanistan’s southern provinces. Only in terms of Gross Domestic Product does opium play a smaller role than in the past. The International Monetary Fund reported that in 2004, opium exports were equal to half of the country’s non-opium GDP. Today, it is closer to about 15 percent. But it still provides about 400,000 jobs, more than the Afghan National Security Forces. Reports from the private research group RAND and the World Bank say the driver is simple economics. Opium offers a better return to farmers than most crops. In a regrettable twist, American-led efforts to make legal crops more lucrative can backfire. In Helmand Province, a project successfully shifted a number of landowners away from poppies, but then they no longer needed the sharecroppers and tenant farmers who had been working the land. World Bank researchers said this "created a displaced, cheap, and mobile population, skilled in poppy cultivation." They moved to marginal land and poppy production increased. Our ruling Yoho said Afghanistan has more land producing poppies than before the U.S. war began. U.N. surveys back that up. In 2002, the country had about 74,000 hectares in poppy cultivation. In 2016, the number was over 200,000. The amount of land used for growing poppies has gone up and down, but the long term trend is definitely up. We rate this claim True.

pomt-08405	Says Alex Sink's plans for governor include $12.5 billion in new spending.	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-alex-sink-practices-obama-math-bud/	Rick Scott says he's running against a woman for governor in Alex Sink who is lock-step in line with the policies of President Barack Obama, and has become fluent in what Scott calls "Obama math." Scott said during an hour-long debate on Oct. 20, 2010, that Sink's policy proposals don't add up unless she's prepared to raise taxes. Yet somehow, she is saying on the campaign she'll be able save taxpayer dollars. "My opponent talks about how she can save $700 million. That's Obama math," Scott said during the debate, which was sponsored by Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association. "Because on the other side of that ... how are you are going to pay for the $12.5 billion in new spending your proposals are going to cost us?" Sink dismissed Scott's spending allegation as "outlandish." But Scott pressed again. "You have big promises. What is the number (in dollars) you're proposing?" Scott asked. "Obama math doesn't work here -- (to) say I'm going to save $700 million and spend $12.5 billion." Sink asked the moderator for a chance to respond. "I don't know what 'Obama math' is," Sink said. "What I do know, I was a 4.0 math major at Wake Forest University and I do know how to add numbers." With less than two weeks until the Nov. 2 election, we're not going to spend time tracking down Sink's Calculus II grades -- though if someone has a transcript, feel free to send us a fax. Instead, we're going to take a look at Scott's claim that Sink is proposing $12.5 billion in new state spending programs. The genesis for this claim actually comes from incoming Republican state Senate President Mike Haridopolos. On Oct. 11, 2010, Haridpolos wrote Sink and said that after studying Sink's campaign positions on her website, he discovered an alarming trend. "Florida's current budget estimates reveal a shortfall of approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion," Haridopolos wrote. "Instead of spending less to stem the tide, it appears that you would propose a staggering $12.5 billion in additional spending on everything from higher pay for state workers to high-speed rail and other areas of government spending. The consequences of these proposed increases in spending would yield nothing short of a crippling $14 billion to $15 billion budget shortfall." Haripodolos never heard back from Sink, and after she deflected the charge during the debate, he responded almost instantly via Twitter. "Just go to Alex Sink's website," he wrote. "$9b for rail from Orlando to Miami, $2b more for schools, and $575m increase in state workers $." The Scott campaign said it's actually $9.2 billion for rail, plus another $350 million for pre-K funding and $302 million in additional student aid, or $12.43 billion overall. Sink's website doesn't list the expenditures as Haridopolos suggests, PolitiFact Florida found out. The math comes from Republicans interpreting Sink's policy positions. Let's quickly walk through them. $9.2 billion for rail -- What Sink says: "Florida's high-speed passenger rail line from Tampa to Orlando is just the first phase of a multi-city rail project. Continued enhancement of Florida's rail system will be a boon to our economy by employing thousands of Floridians over a 20-year period. Alex supports plans for future high-speed and commuter rail lines, and will partner with the Florida Rail Enterprise to fulfill and extend Florida's comprehensive rail vision." How Scott interprets it: Florida received $1.25 billion in federal money to begin constructing a Tampa to Orlando high-speed rail line. But that money will only cover about half the total cost of construction. It's unclear where the other half will come from. The next phase of the high-speed rail project would then link Orlando to Miami. That line is longer and anticipated to cost another $8 billion. Again, no funding has been identified. $2 billion more for schools -- What Sink says: "When Florida voters approved a state lottery in 1986, supporters promised it would be used to supplement existing state dollars dedicated to education. In reality, lottery funds have actually replaced general revenue (GR) dollars. Prior to 1986, education received almost 61 percent of GR; since then, it has received only 53 percent. The proportion devoted to public schools dropped between 1988 and 2005 from about 70 percent to only 40 percent ... As Florida's economy recovers, Alex Sink will work to reverse the shrinking proportion of Florida's GR investment in education funding. She also will seek to use lottery funding to enhance educational programs as originally intended." How Scott interprets it: Lawmakers spend about $12.5 billion in general revenues on education. If the state increases spending levels as Sink describes, to 61 percent of general revenue, the new cost would be about $14.5 billion. $575 million for pay raises -- What Sink says: "State government employees have not had a general pay raise in the past five years. In 2008, the average annual state employee salary of $38,839 was 4.5 percent below Florida's average wage for all industries. Compared to other states, Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents: 118 per 10,000 compared to the national average of 216 employees per 10,000 residents. And Florida is dead last in the nation in state employee payroll expenditures per resident: $38 compared to the national average of $69 per resident. As Governor, Alex Sink will push to ensure that state employees are recognized for high performance by receiving fair and competitive compensation." (PolitiFact Florida previously fact-checked the payroll comparison to other states). How Scott interprets it: Raising state employee expenditures per resident from $38 to the national average of $69 will cost the state $575 million. $350 million for pre-K funding -- What Sink says: "Florida was one of the first states to make pre-Kindergarten available to all four-year-olds, but our investment in the program ranks us toward the bottom: the state averages less than $2,500 per child while the national average is more than $4,700." How Scott interprets it: Scott says there are 160,000 kids in pre-K. To reach the national average in per-child spending, the state would have to spend an additional $350 million. $302 million in needs-based student aid -- What Sink says: "Florida is one of only a dozen states that spends more on merit-based scholarships than needs-based aid -- comprising only 20 percent of the state's overall student financial aid. Alex Sink will work to strike a fairer balance with merit-based scholarships." How Scott interprets it: Scott says merit-based aid will cost the state $437.3 million in fiscal year 2010-2011. The state will spend $135 million on needs-based aid, Scott says. To make them equal, the state will need to spend $302 million more on needs-based aid. That's how Scott and Haridopolos get to $12.5 billion. We find it a stretch. In some cases, Scott takes Sink's proposed actions -- "will work," "will push," or "will partner" -- and casts them as written in blood promises. But Sink's words are mushy -- probably on purpose. Sink needs the Republican-led Legislature to approve any new spending progams. In other cases, Scott uses Sink's discussions of the national average and extrapolates that she plans to meet national averages when it comes to pre-K funding and state employee pay. But she doesn't say that. In fact, when we pressed Sink's campaign about pay raises for state employees, she didn't lay out any specific proposal and instead highlighted a plan to reduce the state workforce. And there are other caveats Scott fails to mention. The biggest chunk of that $12.5 billion -- nearly three-fourths -- comes from funding high-speed rail. But that money wouldn't come in one year, or even one term. And Sink doesn't say it will come out of the state budget. Any rail expansion likely would include more federal money, or local taxes approved by voters. State money, too, probably. But how much and when? That's a guessing game. Sink prefaces any increased education spending plan with an introductory clause -- "as Florida's economy recovers." Scott ignores that. And Scott hypothesizes that Sink wants to add funding for needs-based student aid rather than simply reallocate existing funding. We think it's certainly fair for Scott to question Sink on how she proposes to pay for something like high-speed rail in Florida (since she hasn't offered a plan), but it's disingenuous to suggest her plan is to simply add that $9.2 billion cost to a $70 billion state budget in one lump sum. It's similarly disingenuous to ignore all the policy statements where Sink says she can save money -- by reforming state contracting, reducing state office space and eliminating unneeded management positions. There are just too many holes in this claim. We rate it False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2010-10-21T18:29:03	2010-10-20	['None']

pomt-14864	"In a period of roughly 72 hours, a small group of angry black students managed to force the resignation of the two highest ranking officials at that school."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/nov/13/megyn-kelly/foxs-kelly-miscasts-mizzou-upheaval-work-small-gro/	A heated debate over race has erupted on several college campuses. This prompted Fox News host Megyn Kelly to lead off her show Wednesday this way: "What started as a campus protest in Missouri might be spreading to more colleges and universities as small groups of students use complaints about race and diversity in a big play to rewrite the rules for everyone," Kelly said on the Nov. 11, 2015, edition of The Kelly File. "In a period of roughly 72 hours, a small group of angry black students managed to force the resignation of the two highest-ranking officials at that school, complaining they did not show enough concern about racial issues at the school." There have been conflicting reports over what led Missouri University president Tim Wolfe and chancellor R. Bowen Loftin to step down Nov. 9. We thought it would help to examine Kelly’s summary that a small group of black students forced that much change in basically three days. The Fox News press office added some nuance to the short timeline Kelly cited. A spokesperson told us while tensions formed weeks ago, things came to a head in the three days before the resignations. Events did pile up quickly in the days before Nov. 9 but evidence coming out of Missouri paints a much more complicated picture than the one Kelly offered her viewers. Most importantly, Wolfe and Loftin fell for different reasons. Race relations were the dominant factor in Wolfe’s demise, but Loftin’s problems stemmed from a revolt among the university’s deans that peaked a month earlier. It also seems that opposition to both men was broader than, as Kelly said, "a small group of angry black students." The standard (simple) storyline Fox News told us that a Google search pulled up more than 8,000 news articles about the role of the students in the resignations. The stories we read generally noted the same series of events leading up to the administrative shake-up at Mizzou. In mid September this year, the president of the Missouri Student Association wrote on Facebook that riders in a pick-up truck had repeatedly used a racial slur toward him. In early October, as a black student group rehearsed outdoors for a homecoming performance, a passing white student began using a racial slur. A few days later on Oct. 10, about a dozen black students surrounded the Missouri president’s vehicle demanding that he address racial tensions on campus. Roughly two weeks after that, feces smeared in the shape of a swastika appeared on a college dorm. No suspect was found. On Nov. 2, a black student started a hunger strike. On Nov. 7, a group of black players on Missouri’s football team announced they would neither practice nor play until Wolfe, the president, resigned. Missouri football coach Gary Pinkel tweeted his support for the players’ strike Nov. 8. On Nov. 9, both Wolfe and Loftin resigned. (Loftin said he would remain with the university in a different role.) It’s easy to understand why the downfall of the two men would merge in the public mind, but that doesn’t make it accurate. Loftin’s long decline It’s important to note that Loftin answered to Wolfe. As university president, Wolfe oversaw the entire university system. Loftin ran all of the academic divisions of the university, from the medical school, to the law school, to the college of arts and sciences, and more. You don’t have to look far to discover that Loftin’s relationship with large swaths of the university community was on the rocks for reasons having nothing to do with the bubbling racial tensions. In fact, nine of the university’s deans in charge of academic divisions asked for Loftin’s removal a month before he stepped down.(Interim and acting deans did not participate.) "We said to the president on Oct. 9 that Loftin should go," Dave Kurpius, dean of the Journalism School told PunditFact. Kurpius said the deans repeated that demand to Wolfe at three meetings in early October. The morning Wolfe resigned in November, they had just sent a letter to Wolfe’s boss, the board of curators, calling for Loftin’s removal. That letter blamed Loftin for creating a "toxic environment through threat, fear and intimidation." Their specific issues involved his botched effort to eliminate graduate assistant health insurance and a total disregard for their roles as managers of their academic centers. Graduate students also had been opposing Loftin. Sarah Senff is co-chair of the Action Committee on the Forum on Graduate Rights. The group was formed in August after Loftin gave them less than a day’s notice that they would lose their health insurance assistance. After an outcry, Loftin reversed himself. "I would vociferously deny that this happened in 72 hours or that this was just black students, " Senff said. "Particularly for Chancellor Loftin, there were numerous issues relating to his competence to lead the university." Senff and other graduate student leaders we contacted cited a bevy of problems including cutbacks in aid for housing, childcare, and tuition waivers. They also rejected Loftin’s decision in September to sever ties with a Planned Parenthood clinic where medical and nursing students had been going to fulfill hands-on experience requirements. Senff said "it has been a semester that has seen protest after protest from various groups." The graduate students’ woes spilled over to the academic departments. William Kerwin is director of graduate studies at Missouri’s English department. On Nov. 3, the faculty voted to declare "No confidence" in Loftin. Their complaints mirrored those of the deans and graduate students. "A whole host of issues were in play regarding Chancellor Loftin," Kerwin said, "Yet the national narrative now sees his departure as driven by the same forces as ended President Wolfe’s tenure here." It is not as though this story was unknown outside of Missouri. The day before Kelly’s show, the Wall Street Journal published an article with the headline Race Wasn’t the Only Issue at University of Missouri. Wolfe’s sudden demise University of Missouri insiders we contacted uniformly told us that race relations were the driving factor in Wolfe’s resignation. Several highlighted his refusal to engage with black students after the incidents in September and October. That precipitated the moment when a dozen activists surrounded his car at the October homecoming. When Wolfe told a group of black students on Nov. 7 that "systematic oppression is because you don’t believe that you have the equal opportunity for success," the uproar only intensified. Eric Scott, a graduate student leader, said it’s accurate to say a core group of black students organized protests. But Smith, who is white, said that hardly captures the extent of the popular rejection of Wolfe. "If we count all the people who have participated in their marches and demonstrations, there were hundreds of members," Smith said. "Hardly a ‘small group of angry black students.’ " Samuel Cohen is an associate English professor. He said Kelly had it right regarding the general role of the students and racial tensions. What she missed, he said, was the two or three months of growing frustration and the upswell of support for his ouster. The tipping point, Cohen said, was the football players "who put their scholarships and careers on the line." "It is technically correct to say it was a small group of students, but if they had been protesting the campus smoking ban or the chancellor's twitter handle, it wouldn't have led anywhere." he said. "It had to be something important that many others saw as worth fighting against." The others who joined in, Cohen said, included students, faculty and staff of many ethnicities. Our ruling Kelly said in a span of about three days, a small group of black students forced the resignations of two top administrators at the University of Missouri. Multiple press reports and interviews with members of the Mizzou community tell us Kelly’s shorthand falls short on several key points. Deans, graduate students, and faculty had been pressing for the ouster of Loftin for at least a month prior to his departure. It is no small matter for deans to make such a demand and they did so three times in early October. Loftin’s problems with the university community go back well into the beginning of the semester. There’s more support for the role of black students in the removal of Wolfe. The evidence tells us that pressure from black students was the driving force and the momentum shifted rapidly against him when a student went on a hunger strike on Nov. 2. However, anger had been growing since mid October and a much larger number of people from across the university community joined the call for Wolfe to step down. Kelly’s statement is only partially accurate. We rate it Half True.	None	Megyn Kelly	None	None	None	2015-11-13T15:29:01	2015-11-11	['None']
pomt-08691	Says State Rep. Kristi Thibaut was an ACORN lobbyist.	true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/09/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-rep-kristi-thibaut-was/	Casting your political foe as a lobbyist — and hence beholden to some special interest — can make for explosive campaign fodder. So it is that the Republican Party of Texas targets first-term state Rep. Kristi Thibaut, D-Houston. "Dem State Rep Kristi Thibaut was an #ACORN lobbyist," the party tweeted Aug. 31, linking to a web video. Earlier the same day, the party had tweeted: "Democrat State Rep. Kristi Thibaut, HD133, was a lobbyist for corrupt ACORN" and before that, "find out which Dem state Rep was a lobbyist for ACORN." ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in March 2010 after a video sting showed ACORN employees in one office telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The 40-year-old, liberal-leaning group, which sought more affordable housing options, a universal health care system and increased voter access, also faced questions — mainly from conservatives — about its voter registration drives. Congress cut off federal funding to the group in September 2009. When we asked the Republican Party to substantiate its claim, spokesman Bryan Preston pointed us to the website kristiworksforacorn.com, where the party posted its research. The web page features a photo of Thibaut with President Obama and links to the web video, which starts with a 2008 audio clip of Thibaut being asked about legislation she'd like to see passed in 2009. "There's a bill that we got behind and supported... we being ACORN," she says. "Being Acorn" is repeated in a sound loop, then the web video jumps to TV news coverage of the ACORN-related uproar. The GOP notes that according to Thibaut's lobby report filed with the Texas Ethics Commission, Thibaut was registered as an ACORN lobbyist in 2007, and expected to earn between $10,000 and $25,000. Also, Thibaut appeared April 25, 2007, on behalf of ACORN at a committee hearing about a proposed constitutional amendment related to home equity loans, according to a Texas House list of witnesses posted online. Also noted on the GOP site: a Feb. 4, 2009, Texas Observer article profiling Thibaut and calling her an "ACORN activist" who unsuccessfully lobbied state lawmakers during the 2007 session for lower utility rates. We confirmed each of the party's citations from state records. Next, Keir Murray, a spokesman for Thibaut's campaign, told us Thibaut was a contract lobbyist for ACORN for the 2007 legislative session. Murray said she "specifically lobbied around the issue of utility rate reduction and affordable housing." "She's proud of the work she did on behalf of low- and moderate-income Texans," he said. "We've never hid from this." In an e-mail, Murray suggested the GOP attack is a red herring: "This is a real stretch to equate her work here in Texas, where ACORN was never, to my knowledge, implicated in any 'fraud,' with the salacious accusations leveled at the organization in other states." There was no evidence of ACORN-driven voter registration fraud in Harris Country — Thibaut's home turf — according to a October 2008 Houston Chronicle article. So, Thibaut lobbied for ACORN, as the GOP tweet says and her campaign acknowledges, though the linked web video associates Thibaut with ACORN's voter-registration fraud and tax evasion issues; there's no evidence of Thibaut having a connection to such activities. Far as it goes, the GOP statement we reviewed is True.	None	Republican Party of Texas	None	None	None	2010-09-09T06:00:00	2010-08-31	['None']
pomt-07564	Says David Prosser = Scott Walker.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/31/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-committee-says-state-supreme-cou/	A TV ad aims to help unseat conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser by comparing him to Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who has become a polarizing figure in the wake of his efforts to reduce the power of public employee unions. The commercial is produced by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, which is also airing an ad critical of Prosser’s handling of a decades-old priest abuse case. We rated the claims in the priest ad Barely True. With its "Prosser will be rubber stamp" ad, the committee’s calculation is that voters angry with Walker will vote for JoAnne Kloppenburg, Prosser’s opponent in the April 5, 2011, election. The 30-second ad -- supported by a website called ProsserEqualsWalker.com -- shows pictures of Prosser and Walker. A narrator begins by asking, "Can we trust David Prosser to be impartial?," and then makes five statements about Prosser and Walker. Those are echoed by messages on the screen. In the end, the ads boil down to this equation: Prosser = Walker. (Yes, that’s a theme in this election. We previously rated a claim that Milwaukee County executive candidate Jeff Stone = Walker as Mostly True.) We’ll evaluate the ad’s five statements -- paying particular attention to those that cite Prosser’s own words -- in terms of how well they support the overall claim. "In the Legislature, Prosser and Walker voted the same way 95 percent of the time." The ad cites votes in the 1995-1996 legislative session, when Prosser and Walker were members of the state Assembly. The Assembly was controlled by the GOP and Prosser served as the speaker. Michelle McGrorty, the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s executive director, said the committee paid for a review of 1,048 roll call votes in which both men participated. Prosser’s campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, didn’t dispute the 95 percent figure. He said it isn’t surprising because "a good majority party puts together a widely supported legislative agenda they can advance." Clearly, 95 percent is a big number and it’s a start in making the "Prosser equals Walker" case. But it is common for members of the same party to vote with each other the vast majority of the time and many of the votes are on minor matters. Prosser and Walker both voted "against the middle class." The ad cites Walker’s and Prosser’s votes against a 1994 bill to raise the minimum wage. The Greater Wisconsin Committee also told PolitiFact Wisconsin that Prosser and Walker voted to allow banks to raise credit card fees; for a state budget proposal that included increases in vehicle registration fees; against making more people eligible for the Healthy Start program; and for a state budget proposal that would allow taxing the income of public employees who retired in other states. In response, Nemoir cited Prosser votes for laws that froze school property tax levies and required the state to pick up two-thirds of the cost of public schools; required employers to give 60 days’ notice of a plant closing; and gave consumers protection against "lemon" vehicles. Nemoir said Prosser also sponsored a bill to allow public defenders to collectively bargain. So, the second statement is very much a mixed bag. "As a judge, Prosser has sided with corporations and against workers." The ad cites two Supreme Court cases in which Prosser voted against the majority of the court in cases involving workers with disabilities. The ad doesn’t mention Walker in this statement, but presumably he is viewed as against workers because of his collective bargaining bill. In 2003, the Supreme Court affirmed that a Barron County employer discriminated against an employee with a disability because it refused to modify her job duties and her work space. In 2004, the court upheld affirmed that an Eau Claire County employer failed to make a reasonable accommodation so that an employee with a disability could continue to work there. Prosser’s campaign countered by citing four decisions -- each authored by Prosser -- that were decided in favor of workers. In 2000, the court ruled that a school district employee had the right to a trial to try to prove she had to quit her job because of harassment. And in three decisions in 2001, the court upheld a pension boost for public employees and retirees; upheld an award of more than $555,000 to a county employee who won a sexual harassment suit; and declared that a fired county employee has a right to a hearing before his vested pension benefits can be denied. This statement is another mixed bag -- some of Prosser’s rulings went against workers, others favored them. "Now Prosser has promised to act as a complement to Walker." The ad cites a news release issued by Prosser’s campaign on Dec. 8, 2010, that called Prosser a "common-sense complement to both the new administration and Legislature." The statement was attributed to Nemoir, but at PolitiFact we attribute a statement from a spokesman as coming from the candidate, who is responsible for it. The reference was to Walker, who had been elected governor in November 2010 but had not yet taken office, and Republicans who would take control of the Senate and Assembly in January 2011. Weeks later, Prosser disavowed the statement. But it left the impression that, rather than being part of an independent judiciary, Prosser saw himself as teaming with Republicans who controlled the executive and legislative branches of government to advance their agenda. This statement supports the Prosser = Walker equation, though Prosser later disavowed it. That leads nicely to the final element. Prosser’s "views 'closely mirror' Walker's" The ad’s fifth statement cites an e-mail sent Dec. 9, 2010 by Nemoir in response to criticism by Kloppenburg about the "complement" comment. The e-mail said Prosser’s "personal ideology more closely mirrors that of the incoming administration and Legislature." So that statement also supports the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s claim. Of course, we’re not limited to the evidence provided by the group. Prosser has also made other comments that relate to himself and Walker. Walker is regarded as a strong conservative. Prosser has in some instances described himself as a conservative, but at other times as a "political moderate" and "in the political center." It is clear, however, that he holds the swing vote in the current 4-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. In a March 24, 2011, meeting with the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Prosser said "what I’ve tried to do is to step back from partisan politics." He cited a ruling he made that favored Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. In the same meeting, Prosser said Walker’s bill constricting the collective bargaining rights of most public employees "is not necessarily legislation that I agree with." In response to the Prosser = Walker claim, Nemoir said Prosser "recognizes his job on the court is to approach each case with impartiality. Had Prosser ruled favorably on a number of lawsuits advanced by the governor or against the governor, perhaps a case could be made. Merely sharing the honor of representing the state as members of the Legislature is not evidence to support such a claim." That brings us to a final piece of context. Even if Prosser and Walker share the same political beliefs, it does not necessarily mean Prosser would vote on the Supreme Court the way Walker would act as governor. Justices must consider the law and legal precedent in making their decisions; and Prosser’s votes, in employment cases alone, show he has not consistently favored one side over another. Similarly, in a claim we rated Barely True, Kloppenburg said Prosser has prejudged matters likely to be heard by the Supreme Court, but she did not cite any specific examples. Let’s assess where we’ve come. In comparing Prosser and Walker, the Greater Wisconsin Committee cites votes the two men made in the Legislature and votes Prosser cast on the Supreme Court -- neither of which amount to strong evidence. Some of Prosser’s own statements, however, indicate a strong similarity between his beliefs and Walker’s. Here is the PolitiFact definition for Half True: "The statement is generally accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context." Here’s our ruling on the claim: Half True.

pomt-07712	As part of efforts to rein in protesters, Republicans in Wisconsin have "bolted windows inside the Capitol shut."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/04/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-response-protester/	The clampdown on the protests at the state Capitol started Feb. 27, 2011, one day after a crowd estimated by some at 100,000 filled the grounds and the state’s iconic building. Protesters who had spent more than two weeks camped inside the building were told the building would be closed for cleaning and they would have to leave. After some confusion, the sleepover was allowed to continue. But access was restricted starting the following day, and the building remained buttoned down for Gov. Scott Walker’s budget address two days later. Visitors were told they had to use a single entrance and have an appointment to meet with a lawmaker. A contingent of about 100 sleepover protesters was allowed to remain in the building, but the Department of Administration wants them out soon. Democrats and union leaders cried foul and sought a court order to reopen the Capitol. The state Democratic Party also turned to the court of public opinion, citing the actions related to the building in a March 2, 2011 news release announcing a recall effort against Republican lawmakers. "If we can recall at least three Senators and regain control of the senate, we can end the ugly games Republicans in the legislature have played in the last few days -- unplugging phone lines, bolting windows inside the Capitol shut, and withholding the paychecks of Democratic legislators," wrote Democratic party chairman Mike Tate on March 2, 2011. Bolting windows? We called Tate to ask for an explanation, but he didn’t respond. Earlier in the week we saw some pictures tweeted showing what appeared to be bolts in wooden windows. You can see them here, here and here. We e-mailed the account that sent out the pictures but did not receive a reply. We also saw an earlier blog posting from the AFL-CIO that claimed Capitol windows were being welded shut. More about that below. So we asked the governor’s office. What’s going on with the Capitol windows? The answer: The windows on the ground level and first floor are being secured, said Tim Donovan, a spokesman for the Department of Administration. (Donovan works for the state Department of Military Affairs and is on loan to DOA because of the crush of media calls.) Make that re-secured. The wooden windows were secured about 10 years ago to prevent anyone from coming into the Capitol through entrances other than doors. Wooden blocks were screwed into the window jambs "to prevent the windows from being raised more than a few inches," Donovan said. In the past week or so, officials realized some of the window blocks had been removed or otherwise damaged. "Those found missing were replaced with tamper-proof bolts," Donovan said. Specifically, Capitol facilities workers drove No. 8 wood bolts into the inside of the window frames, and then cut off the heads off the bolts so they could not be easily removed, Donovan said. As the pictures show, it’s not a fancy replacement. "This is a temporary, quick repair," Donovan said. He was unable to say exactly how many windows were done or when the work took place. It only takes a few seconds to drive a bolt into the woodwork and snap off the head. Donovan said most of the window-securing was done in the rest rooms on the ground and first floor. It’s impossible to determine how and when those windows became unsecured, he said. One of the windows secured was in a first floor office of a legislator, Donovan said. In that case, he said, the lawmakers’ staff filed a work order requesting that the windows be secured. The state Democrats were not the only ones to notice the window projects. A Feb. 28, 2011 blog item by AFL-CIO political communications director Eddie Vale carried this headline: "Walker Welding Capitol Windows NOW to Keep Workers from Passing Food to Those Inside." His item read: "As we speak, Gov. Scott Walker & Senate R's are literally having the windows of the capital welded shut to keep people from passing food into the building to the people inside. "Our attorneys are collecting affidavits from the people who witnessed this, along with people who have been illegally denied access to a public, government, building." We asked Donovan about the welding charge. His answer was simple: "We find that wood doesn’t weld well. It burns." And that brings us back to the Democratic Party’s claim. The party said Republicans have "bolted shut" windows at the state Capitol as part of the "ugly games" being used in response to protests. To be sure, tensions are running high in Madison. But the idea that windows are being bolted shut to somehow curtail protesters is off the mark. It makes sense that windows would be secured so that people couldn’t open them from the outside. You would, no doubt, find similar safety devices on the lower level windows of many apartments in the campus area. It also makes sense that as Capitol Police and facilities staff took stock of the building after weeks of protests they found some windows unsecured. So they fixed them. We’ll let the historic preservation folks pass judgment on the appeal of the quick-and-dirty No. 8 bolt repair. But we’ve got this to say about the Democratic Party’s claim: Pants on Fire. And while we’re at it: Pants on Fire for the welding claim as well.	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2011-03-04T10:00:00	2011-03-02	['Wisconsin', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-06724	Says there’s not "much evidence to suggest that people have (contributed to global warming) or can do very much to change anything."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/31/kevin-coughlin/gop-senate-candidate-kevin-coughlin-says-theres-no/	Kevin Coughlin, a former Republican state legislator from Cuyahoga Falls, has been making Ohio’s political rounds this summer in an effort to capture his party’s nod to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown next year. At an Aug. 18 stop in Strongsville, Coughlin told the Strong Ohio tea party group he believes the science behind global warming is "sketchy." "Scientists who consider themselves to be environmentalists disagree on the science and the impact," Coughlin said. "There is no question that the earth’s core is increasing slightly in temperature. "But the real question and I think what’s pertinent to the debate in our country and in global politics is how much people really contributed to it and I don’t really think there’s much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything." That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. We contacted Coughlin, whose appearance was captured on video by a Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century. He acknowledged making the remarks, although he said meant to say the Earth’s atmosphere -- not its core -- is rising in temperature. But do scientists agree with his assertion that there’s not "much evidence to suggest that people have or can do very much to change anything." Many Republican politicians apart from Coughlin assert that scientists disagree whether human actions contribute to global warming. Before he dropped out of the GOP presidential primary last month, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told the Miami Herald newspaper "the science is in dispute" over "how much, if any" climate change can be blamed on human behavior. At an Aug. 17 New Hampshire campaign stop, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said that scientists are regularly "coming forward and questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change." PolitiFact examined these claims by Pawlenty and Perry, and found them to be False. That’s because there does appear to be a scientific consensus that people contribute to global warming. To begin with, a 2007 report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading international scientific body on climate science, states: "Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone." (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.) A 2009 report from the U.S. Global Change Research Program reached a similar conclusion: "Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities." Current climate change research was reviewed again this year by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences. The committee it assembled concluded that global warming poses significant risks and is happening primarily because of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. It rejected the idea that those findings are in any way questionable. "Although the scientific process is always open to new ideas and results, the fundamental causes and consequences of climate change have been established by many years of scientific research, are supported by many different lines of evidence, and have stood firm in the face of careful examination, repeated testing, and the rigorous evaluation of alternative theories and explanations," the committee’s report said. A few scientists dispute the IPCC’s conclusions on global warming, but most acknowledge that humans contribute to increased temperatures. They make more nuanced points, like questioning whether carbon emissions by themselves are enough to boost temperatures, whether other human activities contribute, whether rising temperatures cause severe weather, and whether public policy change is needed to address potential problems. Climate change skeptics cite an online petition with more than 31,000 signatures to demonstrate their viewpoint is widespread. The petition states "there’s no convincing scientific evidence" that human greenhouse gas releases are disrupting the Earth’s climate, and there’s "substantial evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects" on Earth’s plants and animals. That petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or even proving they exist. But surveys of large numbers of climate researchers show a clear consensus among them that humans are causing climate change. One 2010 study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that 97 to 98 percent out of 1,372 climate researchers who are publishing scientific studies in the field say they believe that human beings are causing climate change, and that the scientific credentials of researchers who doubt that role are "substantially below that of the convinced researchers." A study published the previous year by the American Geophysical Union, asked more than 3,100 scientists whether they think human activity significantly contributes to "changing mean global temperatures." About 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered "Yes," with a 97.4 percent affirmative rate among climate change specialists. While a few skeptics out there disagree, there’s clear scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and that humans contribute to it. Disagreement on the subject is scant enough that we rule Coughlin’s statement is False.	None	Kevin Coughlin	None	None	None	2011-08-31T06:00:00	2011-08-18	['None']
pomt-04529	Says the "public option" considered in the health care law backed by U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin was "wildly unpopular."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/01/us-chamber-commerce/chamber-commerce-says-health-care-public-option-id/	"Are you listening," Tammy? That’s the question posed in new campaign ad portraying Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin as indifferent to constituent pleas about Medicare. In the spot, funded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an actress posing as Baldwin eagerly deletes phone messages from regular folks calling her office line. "Does it make you mad Tammy Baldwin voted to cut $716 billion from Medicare?" a narrator asks. Meanwhile, the phone messages play: "My mom depends on Medicare, why would you vote to cut it?" Delete. "Keep your hands off my Medicare!" Delete. The spot concludes by urging a vote against Baldwin, and asks, incredulously: "Can you believe Tammy even supported the wildly unpopular public option?" We’re familiar with the "cut Medicare" claim, which Republicans and allies have leveled since the 2010 "Obamacare" health reform law passed with support from Democrats including Baldwin, a House member. In one example, the Chamber of Commerce said "seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund Obamacare." That was rated Mostly False by PolitiFact Florida, which found that "Medicare spending is still set to increase, just not at as high a rate as originally anticipated." (The difference -- first estimated at $500 billion, now at $716 billion -- helps pay for other parts of the law). Remember the so-called "public option?" That’s what we’re looking at here: Did Baldwin vote for something that was "wildly unpopular"? The idea -- ultimately left out of the bill -- was to create government-run health insurance to compete with private plans. The public option was an alternative to a "single payer system" or so called "Medicare for all." It was floated in part to appease more liberal Democrats who were critical of the bill’s reliance on private health insurers. We rated Mostly True a claim by GOP Senate candidate Tommy Thompson that Baldwin "wants a health care system that is completely government controlled" and goes beyond ObamaCare. In that item, we noted Baldwin favored a public option or a single-payer system. But the thrust of the claim was that the public option was "wildly unpopular." That is, Baldwin took a position most people at the time opposed. We asked the U.S. Chamber, which wants to repeal the health care law, for backup for its claim. The group cited two public opinion surveys: An NBC News poll (August 2009) found a 47 percent plurality against the public option and a Rasmussen Reports voters’ poll (July 2009) showed only 35 percent support. But what about other polls taken at the time? We turned to the archives of the respected Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, which maintains a huge database mostly of media and commercial polls. With help from Roper, we found 32 poll questions that asked directly about the public option from April 2009 to March 2010, when the law passed. They were from polls by or for Gallup, Bloomberg, the Kaiser Family Foundation, NBC/Wall Street Journal, CNN, the Independent Women’s Forum, CBS, the Democracy Corps, ABC/Washington Post and others. In other words, mostly polls by or for the mainstream media and established polling organizations, with a sprinkling of surveys for groups with ideological leanings on the left and right. Here’s what we found: -- Of the 32 polls, support for the public option outweighed opposition in 28 of them. -- Across those 28 polls, the average size of the group that favored the option was 57 percent. The opposition group averaged 38 percent in those polls. -- There were four polls in which opposition was stronger than support; 53 percent was the average size of the negative group in those polls. One was the NBC poll pointed out to us by the Chamber of Commerce. The Rasmussen poll did not turn up in our search. But it did show -- as the Chamber said -- only 35 percent of likely voters supported a public option. In the poll, 50 percent said they opposed it. Now, we’re sure we didn’t look track down every poll or poll question taken on this topic. But the clear conclusion from a deep dive into the polls is that opinion leaned pretty strongly in favor of a public option. Beyond that, there is no evidence for the Chamber’s claim of "wildly unpopular" -- the highest negative rating they sent us as back up was 50 percent. The Chamber told us that, polling aside, the public option was "deeply unpopular" in the business community, its primary constituency. That may be true, but the claim made in the ad focused on the opinions of regular folks -- the ones dialing up Baldwin. A final note: The Chamber of Commerce, as well as Republican critics of the polling, say that when pollsters drilled down, support for a public option waned as people heard details or were presented with possible ramifications. We noticed that as well in some surveys. But a significant number of people’s support for Obama’s reform plan overall was conditioned on his including a public option. Our rating The Chamber terms the Baldwin-supported public option "wildly unpopular." That’s way off target based on a broad look at surveys taken during the health care debate. The public option was far more popular than not, though some of that support was fickle. We rate the group’s claim False.

pomt-13284	Says Sidney Blumenthal wrote that the Benghazi attack was "almost certainly preventable. Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect U.S. personnel and an American consulate in Libya."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-incorrectly-pins-benghazi-criticism-s/	At a Pennsylvania rally the day after the second presidential debate, Donald Trump energized the crowd by reading directly from a recent Wikileaks release of Democratic emails. The topic: the deaths of four Americans in a 2012 attack on a U.S. complex in Benghazi, Libya. "Here's an interesting one: Sidney Blumenthal," Trump said to boos, referring to a longtime confidant of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Trump, speaking in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Oct. 10, continued (at about the 44-minute mark.): "Do you remember when Ambassador (Chris) Stevens in Benghazi was calling, and writing -- they were desperate for help. They say like 600 times, right? The only one she was speaking to is Sidney Blumenthal, who's a sleaze. He's a sleaze. In fact, Obama wanted her restricted (so) that she couldn't speak (to him). That's probably one of the reasons she wanted to have her private server, you know? Because she promised Obama that she wouldn't be talking to sleazy Sidney. "So, Blumenthal writes a quote -- this just came out a little while ago. I have to tell you this. (Trump reads from paper.) ‘One important point has been universally acknowledged by the nine previous reports about Benghazi’ -- this is Sidney Blumenthal, the only one she was talking to. ... " ‘The attack was almost certainly preventable’ -- Benghazi. ‘Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect the United States personnel and an American consulate in Libya’ -- he meant Benghazi. ‘If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate.’ "In other words, he is now admitting that they could have done something about Benghazi. This just came out a little while ago." There’s a problem with what Trump said: Blumenthal didn’t write those words. Following the rally in Wilkes-Barre, Kurt Eichenwald, a Newsweek reporter, wrote an article in which he noted that he had written those words himself. "Those words sounded really, really familiar," Eichenwald wrote. "Really familiar. Like, so familiar they struck me as something I wrote. Because they were something I wrote." Specifically, an article he wrote from Oct. 21, 2015, titled, "Benghazi Biopsy: A Comprehensive Guide to One of America's Worst Political Outrages." In general, the article criticized Republicans for politicizing Benghazi. It concludes in part: "In the end, one thing is clear: This rabid partisanship or unmitigated deception or utter incompetence conflicts with everything this country stands for. Four men died serving their country; it is beyond disgraceful that their memories are used for cartoons and political buttons and television shows all for the purpose of advancing outright falsehoods just to gain political points. In their refusal to read documents or accept facts over fantasies, Republican conspiracy theorists have damaged this country in ways that cannot yet be fully comprehended." However, elsewhere in the article, Eichenwald listed some areas of inquiry that he considered valid for investigation, and that were in line with investigations done after previous deadly attacks: "One important point has been universally acknowledged by the nine previous reports about Benghazi: The attack was almost certainly preventable. Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect U.S. personnel at an American consulate in Libya. If the GOP wants to raise that as a talking point against her, it is legitimate." The important thing to note here is that Eichenwald, a journalist, wrote those words, not Blumenthal. So how did Blumenthal get wrapped up in this? As it turns out, one of the emails leaked by Wikileaks was sent by Blumenthal to Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. The email in question was sent on the same day the Newsweek article came out; it was addressed to "undisclosed recipients." In the email, Blumenthal forwarded Eichenwald’s article, with the header, "Key Section. Then whole article below." It includes both a link to the article and some text from it, including Eichenwald’s byline. Here's a screenshot: How Eichenwald’s words and Blumenthal’s became conflated is open to debate. Eichenwald pointed to Sputnik, a Russian website, which wrote an article that indicated that the words were Blumenthal’s. (The original Sputnik article has since been pulled from the Web.) Other observers, including BuzzFeed News’ Jon Passantino, have pointed to a viral tweet as the source instead. Either way, what is not in doubt is the inaccuracy of Trump’s comment. At most, one could say that Blumenthal had forwarded an article, without added commentary, to Podesta. But that doesn’t make those words Blumenthal’s, and it does not mean that this is a case of Blumenthal "admitting that they could have done something about Benghazi," as Trump said. It’s much more plausible that Blumenthal, a Clinton loyalist, was forwarding the article to Podesta because of its overall, forcefully worded argument that the Republicans had turned Benghazi into a political football, not because of a couple cautionary sentences out of a 10,000-word article. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check.. Our ruling Trump said that Blumenthal wrote that the Benghazi attack "was almost certainly preventable. Clinton was in charge of the State Department, and it failed to protect U.S. personnel and an American consulate in Libya." But Blumenthal didn’t write those words; Eichenwald did. We rate the statement False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-11T14:34:04	2016-10-10	['United_States', 'Bill_Clinton', 'United_States_Department_of_State', 'Libya', 'Benghazi']
pomt-04696	Says she was misquoted and "didn’t say" that the Israeli ambassador said "what the Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/sep/05/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-said-she-didnt-make-comments-abo/	Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz found herself on the defensive about comments she made to Jewish supporters on the eve of her party’s convention in Charlotte, N.C. The topic: comments she said were made by Israeli ambassador Michael Oren about Republicans and Israel. The debate about what the South Florida congresswoman said began Monday, after Michael Barone at the conservative Washington Examiner wrote about her comments in front of a group of Jewish Democrats. Here is the exact quote from the Examiner, including a typo and an incomplete phrase in quotes at the end: "National Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz spoke and was warmly received as she extolled Obamacare (Democrats are using the term) and said she has heard Israel’s Ambassador Michael Oren say, in her words, ‘what the Republicans is dangerous for Israel.’" On Tuesday morning, the Examiner’s Philip Klein gave a more detailed explanation of her comments, which occurred at a training session for Jewish Democrats. "As she was wrapping up her remarks, she claimed that, ‘We know, and I’ve heard no less than Ambassador Michael Oren say this, that what the Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel,’" Klein wrote. The Examiner also wrote that Wasserman Schultz said Republicans were "undermining Israel’s security by suggesting that the United States and Israel don’t have anything other than a unique and close and special relationship. It undermines Israel’s security to its neighbors in the Arab world and to its enemies. And we need to make sure that the fact that there has never been and will never be daylight between the two parties or the support for Israel that we have in the United States, that that is conveyed to Jewish Americans across this country. That’s our responsibility. It’s the responsibility we’re asking all of you to take on." On Tuesday afternoon, the ambassador reacted to the Examiner report. "I categorically deny that I ever characterized Republican policies as harmful to Israel," the statement from Oren read. "Bipartisan support is a paramount national interest for Israel, and we have great friends on both sides of the aisle." Wasserman Schultz then went on Fox News Tuesday evening. Fox News repeated her quote about Oren and she responded: "I didn’t say he said that," she said. "And unfortunately, that comment was reported by a conservative newspaper. It’s not surprising that they would deliberately misquote me. What I always say is that unfortunately the Republicans have made Israel a political football, which is dangerous for Israel. And Ambassador Oren has said that we can’t ever suggest that there is any daylight between the two parties on Israel, because there isn’t. And that that’s harmful to Israel. That’s what I said, and that is accurate. We have to make sure that in America we don’t have people who put their love of party in front of their love of Israel. As the first Jewish woman to represent Florida in Congress, I take my love of Israel to work with me every single day, and I want to make sure that we re-elect President Obama." We wanted to explore exactly what Wasserman Schultz said at the training session. We can’t know for sure what Oren might have said to Wasserman Schultz. But we can research Wasserman Schultz’s remarks and whether she was misquoted. Obama received a majority of the Jewish vote in 2008, but both parties are clamoring for the Jewish vote which could be key in any state with the potential for a close outcome, including Florida. Audio clip of Wasserman Schultz After Wasserman Schultz denied that she made the statement, the Examiner posted about a one-minute audio clip of her speaking at the event. Here’s our transcript of her remarks: "We want you to be armed with the facts. So we are going to give you those facts. We have a one-page document that succinctly describes President Obama’s stellar record on Israel. We have a six-page document as well, because we’re Jews and one page really isn’t enough," she said which drew laughter from her audience. "And we have a myths versus facts document, which addresses a lot of the typical baloney that is spewed by Republicans. Let me just close by telling you this and sharing this with you. We know, and I’ve heard no less than Ambassador Michael Oren say this, that what the Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel. They are undermining Israel’s security by suggesting that the United States and Israel don’t have anything other than a unique and close and special relationship. It undermines Israel’s security to its neighbors in the Arab world and to its enemies. And we need to make sure that the fact that there has never been and will never be daylight between the two parties or the support for Israel that we have in the United States, that that is conveyed to Jewish Americans across this country, that’s our responsibility, and it’s the responsibility we’re asking all of you to take on...." (The documents she was referring to are here, and here and here.) Wasserman Schultz’s explanation Miami Herald political reporter Marc Caputo asked Wasserman Schultz about her dispute with the Examiner, and Miami Herald reporter Erika Bolstad shared that audio with us: "What they put in the paper is not a surprise because they are a conservative gotcha-type publication. They ripped one line out of what I said and left the rest so it appeared as though I was saying something that I wasn’t. In fact that line is the opposite of what I always say, which is, and I will say again: It is dangerous to turn Israel into a political football as the Republicans are trying to do. It's dangerous for Israel because to suggest that there is any separation on Israel between the two parties, any daylight harms Israel in the eyes of its neighbors, our neighbors and its enemies. That’s what I said and what I always say. We know that there is little we agree on in Washington but strong bipartisan support for Israel and President Obama’s stellar record, it’s important to make sure that that is clear and consistent message and not put love of party before the love of Israel." Caputo repeatedly asked Wasserman Schultz to explain what Oren actually said to her. She said that she spoke to Oren yesterday and said that the Examiner didn’t report her comments in the full context. She also said that she said what she always says. We also received this statement from the DNC communications staff: "The Examiner misrepresented the chairwoman’s remarks. What she said is what she has stated repeatedly before: what jeopardizes Israel's security is the suggestion, for partisan political gain, that the election of either political party would weaken the long-standing relationship of the United States and Israel. The Examiner’s piece should be seen for what it is, a blatant misrepresentation of the facts by a conservative outlet." Wasserman Schultz spokesman Jonathan Beeton confirmed that the audio clip of Wasserman Schultz was accurate, but he added that Wasserman Schultz was not reading from prepared remarks and was not directly quoting Oren. "What she is saying is that Ambassador Oren had told her on multiple occasions that using Israel as a political football is dangerous for Israel. ..." Beeton said. "She is not saying he said what Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel." For example, Romney’s comment that Obama has "thrown Israel under the bus" is an example of "what Republicans are doing," Beeton said. Beeton noted what Wasserman Schultz said later in her statement about making sure there "will never be daylight between the two parties" shows she was trying to convey that both parties should share support for Israel to help protect Israel. Beeton gave us this analogy: "It would kind of be like if you and I are walking into McDonald’s and you order a double Big Mac Happy Meal and I go, ‘Amy, what you are doing, and I’ve heard no less than the surgeon general of the U.S. say this, what you are doing right now is dangerous for your health. It doesn’t mean the Surgeon General said, ‘Amy Sherman’s eating habits are dangerous for her health.’ Instead, it would mean that the surgeon general said ‘that type of behavior is dangerous for your health.’" Beeton also pointed us to Oren’s comments in 2010 in Haaretz, the English language newspaper in Israel, where he said, ‘‘Israel has become a partisan issue in the U.S., and this political ping-pong is bad for us." Finally, we should note another example of Wasserman Schultz talking about Oren’s comments. The Examiner linked to this August interview in Hadassah, a Jewish women’s magazine: Hadassah: "Why did you call on both parties to refrain from challenging each other over support for Israel?" Wasserman Schultz: "What the Republicans are doing is dangerous. They are using Israel as a political football.… Israel’s ambassador (to the United States), Michael Oren, has said this. If there is any perception of daylight between the parties on support for Israel, that strengthens Israel’s enemies. The president rejects what some Republican candidates have been saying, that America should review all its foreign aid commitments from zero, making each country justify the support it receives." Our ruling The Examiner wrote that Wasserman Schultz said: "We know, and I’ve heard no less than Ambassador Michael Oren say this, that what the Republicans are doing is dangerous for Israel." The first Examiner report didn’t fully quote Wasserman Schultz. But the next day, the newspaper provided a more complete version -- including audio. She said she didn’t make the remark, but the audio clearly shows her making it. In fairness to Wasserman Schultz, her main point in the extended audio clip is that Republicans have politicized the issue of Israel, and that is what’s dangerous, not that the party’s particular policy positions are dangerous. Her comments about Oren gave the impression that he singled out Republicans for criticism, not that he was commenting on the dangers of politicizing the issue of Israel. But she did make the remark she said she didn’t make, and we rate her claim Pants on Fire. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election. See video fact-checks here.

pomt-03295	The sequester has "already lost 1.6 million jobs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/01/harry-reid/reid-says-sequester-has-already-cost-16-million-jo/	As discussions over the future of the federal budget grind forward, both Democrats and Republicans talk about replacing the sequester -- across-the-board budget cuts hitting much of the federal government -- with something more targeted. So far, the two sides have found little common ground. For their part, the Democrats are eager to highlight the harm sequestration causes. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters this week he was disappointed with what he sees as GOP intransigence. "Let them do whatever they want to do," Reid said. "Talk to the president. My office is always open. I'm anxious to do anything. The sequestration to this point, we have already lost 1.6 million jobs." That seemed like a pretty big number for an economy that has added about 1.2 million jobs in the past six months. We emailed Reid’s office to learn the source behind his statement. We did not hear back. Under the rules of sequestration, the government will cut about $85 billion in spending by the end of this fiscal year. Setting aside long-term consequences to the federal debt, putting money into the economy does create jobs and the reverse is also true - less money leads to fewer jobs in the short run. We asked Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a private research group, what he thought of Reid’s number. His answer was brief. "I have no way of evaluating this at all, there is no official count of job losses due to the sequester," Shepherdson said. Sal Guatieri, vice president at BMO Capital Markets, another economics research group, also said he had no estimate."It is difficult to calculate both the direct and indirect effects," Guatieri said. Back in February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that sequestration would reduce the number of jobs by 750,000 by the end of the year. That is about half the figure Reid used, and in any event, we are not yet at the end of the year. Reid said we have already lost 1.6 million jobs because of sequestration. The source of Reid’s number seems to be a CBO letter to Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who asked what would happen if the sequestration were canceled for the rest of this year and 2014. The CBO said that would increase spending by $14 billion in 2013 and about $90 billion the next year. According to its model, this would boost employment by anywhere between 300,000 to 1.6 million. That is a forecast for what would happen in the future, 2014, not an estimate of the sequester’s current impact. While the number of jobs would rise, the letter also cautions that "if the spending reductions under current law were reversed, that policy would lead to greater federal debt, which would eventually reduce the nation’s output and income below what would occur under current law." Our ruling Reid said that sequestration has already led to the loss of 1.6 million jobs. There is no official estimate of the current impact of the sequester, and Reid's office provided no proof for the claim. The figure Reid seemed to rely on is a projection of the number of jobs that might be created if Congress put the sequester on hold and spent about $100 billion more than is currently planned. And from that forecast, Reid appears to have used the high end. We rate the statement False.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2013-08-01T14:58:24	2013-07-30	['None']
pomt-08067	On whether state employees should contribute to their pensions.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/22/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-flip-flops-state-employees-pensi/	On his way to the Executive Mansion, Bob McDonnell emphatically pledged not to reduce the state’s level of contribution to the retirement benefits of state employees. Back In September 2009, then-Gov. Timothy M. Kaine proposed having employees contribute a portion of their salaries toward their pensions as part of an effort to close an anticipated $1.35 billion revenue shortfall in the state’s recession-wracked budget. McDonnell didn’t like that idea, as documented on his campaign website. "The tough fiscal climate...is no excuse for breaking a longstanding commitment to the men and women who have dedicated their careers to the service of Virginia’s people" the Republican gubernatorial candidate said. In the release, McDonnell noted the state has paid its workers’ pension contributions since 1983 as a compromise for not offering workers a pay raise that year. "The compromise represents a promise made by the Commonwealth to state workers," McDonnell said. "That promise cannot be broken." As governor, McDonnell reinforced that commitment in April 2010. "Current state and many local employees took their jobs with the expectation that their retirement contributions would come from their employer," McDonnell said. "We cannot turn our back on that agreement." Ultimately, the General Assembly did require new employees hired after July 1 to pay the 5 percent toward their pensions, but not those working the state before that date. Fast forward to last week when McDonnell announced that he will ask the remaining 86,000 state employees to pay 5 percent of their salaries toward their pensions. The governor’s proposal eases the pain by raising pay 3 percent for state employees hired before new retirement rules took effect, meaning the changes would leave them with 2 percent less in take-home pay. McDonnell said the measure was essential to prop a retirement system underfunded by $17.6 billion. The pension plan, like many public retirement systems, has been hurt by the low investment performance and inadequate support from the state government. A year ago, before McDonnell took office, VRS was underfunded by $11.9 billion. Stacey Johnson, McDonnell’s press secretary, acknowledged the governor’s position on employee pension contributions has changed since his candidacy. "Since that time, everyone has learned additional, significant details regarding VRS and the need significant new investment in the immediate future," she said. McDonnell last week told reporters, "The system is broken and badly in need of repair. I will not pass on a broken system to another governor." That’s a noble goal, but a reversal nonetheless.

pomt-13381	"NATO is opening up a major terror division. ... I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-again-about-nato-increasing-ter/	During the first presidential debate at Hofstra University, Donald Trump repeated a claim that he had succeeded in pushing NATO -- the military alliance that includes the United States and Europe -- to increase its efforts on counter-terrorism. "About four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division," Trump said Sept. 26, 2016. "And I think that's great … because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they're going to do that. … I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO." Trump’s claim is False. We’ll explain why. What change at NATO is he referring to? When we checked with experts on NATO and terrorism, several said the likeliest change that Trump would have been referring to was the creation of an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division. Trump has previously tweeted out a Wall Street Journal story on the news and said the alliance "made the change without giving me credit." The new position was officially announced in a communiqué released on July 9, 2016, by member-state representatives at a summit in Warsaw, Poland. Was this a major change? Not really, experts said when we first investigated the claim. "NATO members have been complaining about sharing of intelligence for generations," said Stephen M. Saideman, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Canada who had a fellowship on the U.S. Joint Staff at NATO in 2001. "Every year or two, there is a discussion about how to improve intel sharing." This change, he said, was "not that important." Jorge Benitez, director of NATOSource at the Atlantic Council, agreed. "While the top position is new, it seems most of the staff will come from an internal reorganization of NATO bureaucracy, rather than new additions," he said. "This is because the summit communique describes this new NATO division as making ‘better use of existing personnel and resources.’ " More to the point, Trump’s comment gives the impression that NATO hadn’t been responsive to terrorism until the new division was created. That’s not true at all. NATO involvement in counterterrorism issued its first formal declaration on terrorism in 1980, and it became a significant issue for the alliance on Sept. 11, 2001, said Lisa Sawyer Samp, a senior fellow in the international security program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Indeed, Clinton brought this up in her response to what Trump said at the debate. "NATO invoked Article 5, its collective defense provision, the day after the 9/11 attacks and has focused on dealing with this threat ever since, including most importantly by deploying troops for the past 12 years in Afghanistan," said Ivo H. Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who previously served as Ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama. At its peak, NATO and its partners sent about 40,000 troops to Afghanistan, Benitez said, and this year, there are still about 4,000 troops from NATO allies in Afghanistan. "It is impossible to argue that NATO has not played an overwhelmingly important role in the war on terror," said Timothy Andrews Sayle, an assistant professor of modern global security at the University of Toronto. It’s worth noting that, according to experts, NATO’s structure and role has made it an imperfect vehicle for counter-terrorism. "Allied warfare is exceptionally difficult and fraught with problems of coordination and compatibility," Sayle said. Intelligence sharing has been especially challenging -- a shortcoming that the new position was designed to ease. NATO’s post-9/11 terrorism blueprint did undergo one major overhaul -- but that occurred in 2012, several years before Trump started running for president. The overhaul, as announced at a summit in Wales, states that "the Alliance strives at all times to remain aware of the evolving threat from terrorism; to ensure it has adequate capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist threats." "So it took about a decade to update the initial post-9/11 framework for dealing with terrorism," said Matthew Fay, a defense policy analyst with the Niskanen Center. Did Trump have anything to do with it? This is where Trump’s statement goes off the rails. He said that NATO acted "largely" because of his concerns. But experts agree that nothing of the sort happened. For starters, experts said, leaders of the NATO countries feel little warmth for Trump, suggesting that they wouldn’t do anything to bolster his prospects of becoming president. "It is comical to suggest NATO would change its counterterrorism policy in response to anything Donald Trump has said about it over the course of his campaign," Fay said. "Like his claim that he was against the invasion of Iraq, this is another reflection of the Republican nominee living in a foreign policy world of his own creation." (We checked his position on the Iraq War separately here.) Even more important are the structural obstacles -- namely, that an alliance as broad as NATO tends to take longer to get all its members to sign off on strategic changes. "This is almost certainly just an odd coincidence," Sayle said. "The position would be the result of a very long slog by those who have favored the idea against those who may believe the alliance too large and diffuse to be effective – or safe – for sharing detailed intelligence." Saideman agreed. "NATO never works fast on anything, and most of the major changes are timed to be announced at summits like the Warsaw Summit or smaller meetings where defense ministers and foreign ministers meet." Finally, NATO rejected the notion that Trump had anything to do with the change in a statement to Politico. Our ruling Trump said, "NATO is opening up a major terror division. ... I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO." The change he’s apparently referring to -- the creation of a new senior post and division for coordinating intelligence sharing -- is just the most recent incremental change in how the alliance handles counter-terrorism, a topic it has addressed, in big ways and small, for more than 30 years. There is no evidence that the change was made in response to Trump’s complaints about the alliance. Experts said such changes typically require a longer gestation period so that all member nations can get on board.

pomt-00992	Louisiana’s film incentives program is so big "they actually shot an upcoming film initially titled ‘Don’t Mess With Texas’ in New Orleans!"	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/feb/07/paul-stekler/paul-stekler-says-louisiana-incentives-best-nation/	Texans oft think everything — everythang — is bigger and better here. So we were startled when a University of Texas professor declared neighboring Louisiana has a big leg up. Paul Stekler, who chairs the UT Department of Radio-Television-Film, said in a commentary posted online by the Austin American-Statesman Jan. 23, 2015, that the Texas film industry may be imperiled unless state lawmakers bolster a state incentives program. Things were dandy a decade ago after Texas launched its program to encourage film production in the state, Stekler wrote. But other states beefed up, Stekler said, adding: "The biggest program is in Louisiana — so big that they actually shot an upcoming film initially titled ‘Don’t Mess With Texas’ in New Orleans!" Neaux way! By phone, Stekler told us his conclusion about the Louisiana incentives causing the movie centered on Texas to be made in the Crescent City was just "common sense. If it’s a Texas-based film, why would you film in Louisiana — unless they were getting a much better deal?" he said. He urged us to consult the Texas Film Commission, which is part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s office. Abbott’s office did not address our inquiries, but we spotted a summary of the Texas program’s declared effects in a January 2015 report by the Texas House Select Committee on Economic Development Incentives. By offering rebates to successful applicants with confirmed in-state expenditures, Texas had awarded nearly $147 million in rebates through October 2014, the report said. In turn, awardees spent more than $1 billion in the state over the years, it said. Next, we turned to checking on the Louisiana parts of Stekler’s statement. An online search landed a May 2014 New Orleans Times-Picayune news story saying "Don't Mess With Texas," an action-comedy starring Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara, was to be filmed in Louisiana starting that month. For Witherspoon, the story said, the production marked a return to New Orleans: She was born there in 1976 while her father was in school. The story made no mention of incentives causing the film not to be shot in Texas. But incentives are in play. Christopher Stelly, who oversees the state’s film outreach, confirmed the film’s producers submitted an application for incentive credits and anticipated spending about $34 million in Louisiana. As of February 2015, Stelly said by email, the state hadn’t fielded an audit to validate any related spending so credits had yet to be awarded. We asked if Louisiana has the nation’s biggest film incentives program, as Stekler wrote. "We have one of the more popular programs," Stelly said by phone. A state spokesman, Ron Thibodeaux, forwarded an April 2013 report written for a state agency indicating that in 2012, $218 million in incentives were awarded to producers who spent $717 million making movies in Louisiana (up from $677 million spending the year before). By a recent news account, the Louisiana program is bigger than other states’ programs. The Dec. 2, 2014, news story in the Advocate, a Louisiana newspaper, called the state’s film tax incentive program "one of the state’s most popular and fastest-growing giveaways, and thanks to its industry-friendly provisions, the Pelican State has eclipsed Hollywood as the feature film production capital of the nation." Of 107 projects shot in the state in 2013, the story said, 49 were feature films — more than were filmed in any other state. Also, the story said, Louisiana’s program is the "richest of its kind" in the country, covering "between 30 and 35 percent of in-state production costs, including eight-figure actor salaries, as long as a film’s local costs top $300,000." A graphic with the story, attributed to Cast & Crew Entertainment Services, which vends payroll services to productions, indicates each of the states touching Texas offers greater tax incentives for making movies: Source: News story, "Giving Away Louisiana: Film tax incentives,", the Advocate, Dec. 2, 2014 (Map information attributed to Cast and Crew Entertainment Services) We asked Stelly if the movie singled out by Stekler was made in Louisiana due to its incentives outpacing incentives available in Texas. He said he didn’t know. But generally, Stelly said, "the way the business works today, incentives do play a major part in the decision-making process. But again, at the end of the day, you have to look at what the area has to offer. How is the crew base? What is the infrastructure? Do you have what it takes?" Louisiana, he said, has hosted projects set "anywhere from New York to outer space," including "Texas Killing Fields," a 2011 crime drama. We asked a publicist for the film itself about whether Louisiana’s incentives caused the movie to be made there. Jayna Zelman, representing MGM, declined to comment though she emailed a web link to an Internet Movie Database (IMDb) page stating the movie, set for release in May 2015, is lately named "Hot Pursuit." Plot summary: "A police officer and a prisoner are on the run in Texas." A linked IMDb page says the movie’s previous working title was "Don’t Mess With Texas." Our ruling Stekler said Louisiana’s film incentives program is so big, "they actually shot an upcoming film initially titled ‘Don’t Mess With Texas’ in New Orleans!" Louisiana has a strong incentives program and a chase movie set in Texas was filmed there; its makers are primed to receive incentive aid. However, we see no confirmation Louisiana’s incentives explain why the movie was shot on the not-Texas side of the Sabine. We rate this partly proven statement Half True.

pomt-03197	"America’s gun-related homicide rate … would be about the same as Belgium’s if you left out California, Illinois, D.C. and New Jersey, places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/29/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-if-you-cut-out-high-gun-homicid/	In a recent Facebook post, former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee used an unusual computation to play down the extent of firearm-related homicides in the United States. "America’s gun-related homicide rate is nearly 20 times that of other high-income nations," Huckabee said in the Aug. 20 post. "But it would be about the same as Belgium’s if you left out California, Illinois, D.C. and New Jersey: places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S." For us, this reminded us of the time one of our sources, in a fact-check about a federal budget claim, joked that "I can meet my weight loss goals if I don't count my butt!" Beyond Huckabee’s curious formula, though, we wondered: Is he right? Huckabee did not respond to an inquiry for this story placed through his website. We did find that variations of this claim had made the rounds on conservative blogs in the weeks before Huckabee authored his post. Let’s take a look at both ends of this claim. The United States For the U.S. part of the claim, we looked at FBI statistics, which break down data for firearm-related homicides for the nation as a whole as well as by state. Here’s a summary for 2010. State Firearm-related homicides Population Rate of firearm-related homicides per 100,000 population California 1,257 37,338,198 3.36 District of Columbia 99 604,912 16.36 Illinois 364 12,841,980 2.83 New Jersey 246 8,799,593 2.79 Four states above 1,966 59,584,684 3.29 U.S. total 8,874 309,330,219 2.87 U.S. minus four states cited by Huckabee 6,908 249,745,535 2.77 So, removing the four states from the equation, as Huckabee did, doesn’t really budge the firearm-related homicide rate for the nation as a whole. Also, it’s worth noting that the three states Huckabee cited are not among the states with the highest rates of firearm-related deaths. (Washington, D.C., is, but it is an exception because it isn’t a state, but rather a city without suburbs or rural areas.) Several states have firearm-related death rates above 4 per 100,000, including one with strict gun laws (Maryland) but others in which Second Amendment protections are strong (Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and South Carolina). Belgium The most recent figures we could find for Belgium are included in an international data comparison published by the United Nations in 2011. In 2004, Belgium reported a firearm-related homicide rate of 0.7 per 100,000, which is well below both the United States as a whole and the U.S.-minus-Huckabee’s-four-states figure. Of course, the data for Belgium is older than the data we used for the United States. However, according to the U.N. compilation, more recent figures for other western European countries show rates even lower than Belgium’s. In 2009 and 2010, the only European countries to post a rate higher than 0.4 per 100,000 were Croatia, Finland, Macedonia, Portugal and Serbia. Every other European nation that reported data during that period was below that threshold. (The Washington Post has published this chart, based on the U.N. data, that compares the advanced industrialized nations by their firearm-related death rate; it shows the U.S. with a much higher rate than any such nation except for Mexico.) So Huckabee’s comparison isn’t even close. Our ruling Huckabee said that "America’s gun-related homicide rate … would be about the same as Belgium’s if you left out California, Illinois, D.C. and New Jersey, places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S." Not only is this a strange way to analyze the numbers, but it’s not even correct on its own terms. Even after subtracting these four supposedly high-crime jurisdictions, the firearm-related homicide rate in the United States is still about four times higher than the rate in Belgium and the rest of Europe. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2013-08-29T09:30:00	2013-08-20	['California', 'Illinois', 'United_States', 'New_Jersey', 'Washington,_D.C.', 'Belgium']
pomt-12158	The new tax will make soda sold in Chicago among the most expensive in the country.	true	/illinois/statements/2017/aug/07/illinois-policy-institute/chicago-soda-tax-throws-batting-practice-fastball-/	On Aug. 2, Cook County became the largest government in the United States to charge a tax on sweetened drinks. The debut of the penny-an-ounce charge for drinks sweetened with sugar or non-caloric sweeteners wasn’t exactly smooth, nor was it particularly well received with the soft drink-consuming public. Customers who examined their receipts at some stores found they had been charged extra for flavored seltzer water -- which is not subject to the new tax -- while restaurant patrons discovered those "free" refills now cost one cent per ounce. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As soft drink consumers and sellers came to grips with the new charges, the libertarian Illinois Policy Institute – never a fan of any tax, and a particularly harsh critic of the tax habits of Cook County and Chicago – framed the drink tax in a consumer unfriendly light. "The new tax will make soda sold in Chicago among the most expensive in the country," the institute said in a tweet and in the headline of an article on its website. That is a little like proclaiming the sun rises in the east, but given intense public interest in the soda tax we thought it was a worth a look anyway. Stack ‘o’ taxes Accompanying the institute’s tweets were graphics illustrating the various taxes that now will be paid by those purchasing sweetened drinks in Chicago. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Chicago already charged a 3 percent soft drink sales tax, and that was on top of a 10.25 percent sales tax that includes state and local portions and is the highest of any major city in the United States. For a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans or bottles of any sweetened soft drink, regular or diet, the sweetened beverage tax adds another $1.44. Thus, a 12-pack priced at $4 costs $5.97 at the register. The new tax adds 67 cents to a two-liter bottle. If marked on the shelf at $2.49, the new tax means you’ll pay 40 percent more at checkout. That’s how it works in Chicago, where the total price figures to be slightly higher than in the rest of Cook County even though the soda tax applies in the suburbs as well. Does that make Chicago-bought soda "among the most expensive in the country?" Elite company The institute grants its statement a lot of leeway by using the word "among." Wherever the thirsty buy it, a Big Gulp is a Big Gulp is a Big Gulp. So the add-on cost of taxes is likely the prime factor behind any significant price differences. To date, the list of places embracing a soda tax is an extremely short one, hence Chicago’s (and Cook County’s) emergence as among the most expensive places to pop for a pop. As it stands today, Cook County is one of only eight U.S. locations to impose or plan to impose a per-ounce tax on sweetened drinks. The other seven are cities and, with a population of 5.2 million, Cook County is by far the largest jurisdiction to adopt such a tax. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Issue-wise, this is right in the Illinois Policy Institute’s wheelhouse. It not only piles expense onto an extremely popular category of consumer products, but it also comes swathed in nanny state good intentions for the health of Cook County residents. By strange coincidence, this health concern arrives just as Cook County finds itself in desperate financial straits. (In another article, the institute claims Cook County can’t even get its nanny state act right, as federal rules prohibit applying the new tax to sweetened drinks purchased with food stamps. It notes that "polling shows people with lower incomes are more likely to drink soda.") At one cent per ounce, Cook County is on the lower end of the soda tax scale. In Boulder, Colo., that two-liter soda will cost an extra $1.35 and a 12-pack will be $2.88 more. Cook County is also one of the three jurisdictions in which voters did not voluntarily adopt the tax by referendum. (Illinois has no provision for such referenda.) There have been many complaints that Cook County’s soda tax was sold to voters as an anti-obesity measure but also includes drinks containing non-caloric sweeteners. But the ordinance itself contains extensive language citing studies that link even diet drink consumption to kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Cook County and the city of Philadelphia are the only places where drinks sweetened with non-caloric sweeteners also are subject to the tax. Thus, even among the eight places in the nation taxing or preparing to tax consumers by the ounce for sweetened soft drinks, Cook County’s measure reaches an especially broad swath of consumers. Our ruling The Illinois Policy Institute cites Cook County’s new sweetened drink tax as making soda sold in the city of Chicago "among the most expensive in the country." With Chicago already charging the nation’s highest sales tax of any major city plus a 3-percent soft drink tax, it’s almost certain that consumers in the city paid "among" the highest prices for soft drinks in the country even before the Aug. 2 arrival of the sweetened drink tax. But Chicago truly moved into a select group when its home county joined the seven other cities that have enacted or are poised to enact by-the-ounce taxes on sweetened soft drinks. With a nod to Captain Obvious, we raise a glass of flattened, left-out-in-the-open Coke in the direction of the Illinois Policy Institute as we rate this statement True.

pomt-10636	The Mormon religion has "a plan that will see the Constitution thrown out and replaced by a theocracy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/08/freedom-defense-advocates/no-evidence-to-support-conspiracy-theory/	A strident letter mailed to voters in late December 2007 attacked Mitt Romney and the Mormon faith, also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or the LDS Church. The 11-page letter makes a number of claims, both political and theological, many of which are disputed by Mormons themselves and other sources. In the interest of brevity, we confined ourselves to checking the false contention that the Mormon faith has a "devious plan for our country" that advocates the overthrow of the Constitution in favor of a government run by Mormon religious authorities. (To read the letter for yourself, it's available on the Internet here .) The letter's claim is "unhinged" and "rooted in no reality," said Michael Cromartie, vice president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a think tank that studies the role of religion in public life. Cromartie is a conservative Protestant. "And if you're going to have a Mormon theocracy, who's going to lead it? Mitt Romney or Harry Reid from Nevada?" asked Cromartie. (Reid, also a Mormon, is the Democratic majority leader in the U.S. Senate and on the other end of the political spectrum from Romney.) "It's one of those claims that so absurd you don't want to dignify it by responding to it," agreed Kathleen Flake, a professor of religious history at Vanderbilt University who studies the Mormon faith and is a Mormon herself. "There's no evidence to support such a claim as a cabal." "It's so far from what Mitt Romney would ever want, I can't imagine it," said Jan Shipps, professor emeritus of history and religious studies at Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis. Shipps, a Methodist, is considered the most prominent non-Mormon historian who studies the religion. "It's a conspiracy theory," she said. We checked official teachings from the Mormon Church, and found that it has an policy of political neutrality. Its Web site states: "The Church's mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, not to elect politicians. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is neutral in matters of party politics." The church also says it does not advise its members on which candidates or parties they should vote for. "This policy applies whether or not a candidate for office is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," the Web site states. Accusations that the church wants to abolish the Constitution are not new, say people who monitor attacks on the Mormon faith. "This is old chestnut stuff that we've dealt with for years and years and years," said Greg Kearney, a member of the Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research, a nonprofit organization that runs a Web site explaining and defending Mormon doctrine, belief and practice. He read the letter at our request. "The idea that Mormons speak with one political voice and one political motive is just plain nonsense," Kearney said. "I'm a liberal, Labor, New Deal Democrat." We interviewed the author of the letter, John M. Boyd of California, who describes himself as a Christian and a cult expert. He agreed that overthrowing the Constitution is not part of current Mormon teaching and "wouldn't happen overnight." But it could happen if a catastrophe occurred and a Mormon president decided the end of the world was at hand, based on Mormon historical writings, he said. Boyd sent out the letter in the name of a recently formed political action committee called Freedom Defense Advocates, but he said he was motivated not by politics, but by his beliefs as a nondenominational Christian. He said he is conservative, but not affiliated with any campaign and hasn't decided who he's supporting for the Republican nomination. "This is about the theological issues that surround the religion of one of the candidates, who happens to be Mitt Romney," Boyd said. "I classify the Mormon church as a cult." The letter adds an entrepreneurial kicker at the end –- it urges readers to send in money for DVDs that attack the Mormon church. Boyd declined to name the financial backers of Freedom Defense Advocates, but said the letter had been mailed to "thousands of people throughout the whole of the United States … a very sizable amount." The theological differences between Mormons and other Christians are complex and multifaceted. But significant areas of theological difference involve Holy Scriptures and the concept of God. Mormons believe Joseph Smith, the church's founder who died in 1844, discovered additional books of Scripture in the United States. Those books form the Book of Mormon, which Mormons consider as Scripture in addition to the Bible. Their concept of the nature of God differs as well. Protestants and Roman Catholics believe that God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are different aspects of one being who has existed eternally. Mormons believe that God the Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are separate entities, and that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are subordinate to God the Father. The Mormon belief that God the Father created all things is the root of the "Jesus and the Devil are brothers" claim that came up earlier in the campaign when Mike Huckabee mentioned it to the New York Times . (He later apologized to Romney.) The contention, which is repeated in the letter, is based on a kernel of truth, but distorted. Under Mormon teaching, God created everyone, so every person or being who has ever existed is Jesus' brother or sister. We asked the Romney campaign for a response to the letter, and they gave us the following statement: "It is sad and unfortunate that this kind of bigotry has been employed. There is absolutely no place for these attacks in American politics. Governor Romney isn't going to dwell on attacks from his opponents. Rather, his campaign is about the issues that are important to the American people, and bringing conservative change to Washington." As for the facts behind the claim that the Mormon religion wants to see the Constitution revoked and the government run by Mormon religious leaders, we find a decided lack of concrete evidence. And given the extreme nature of the claim, we must give it our Pants on Fire ruling.	None	Freedom Defense Advocates	None	None	None	2008-01-08T00:00:00	2007-12-22	['None']

pomt-14032	"Right now, in every major poll, national poll and statewide poll done in the last month, six weeks, we are defeating Trump, often by big numbers and always at a larger margin than Secretary Clinton is."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/29/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-he-polls-better-against-donald/	Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is behind in the delegate count by near-insurmountable numbers, but he makes the case that he’s a better nominee for November because he polls better than Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchups against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Sanders made the point again during the May 29, 2016, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press. "Right now," Sanders said, "in every major poll, national poll and statewide poll done in the last month, six weeks, we are defeating Trump often by big numbers, and always at a larger margin than Secretary Clinton is." We checked a similar assertion by Sanders in March and found it to be Mostly True. But there have been new polls since then, so we decided to take a new look. As we did previously, we looked at polls taken during the last six weeks that are listed on RealClearPolitics.com and that tested Trump’s support against both Clinton and Sanders. (An additional five polls tested only Clinton against Trump, but we won’t count those.) Here’s a summary: Poll Date Clinton vs. Trump Sanders vs. Trump Sanders advantage over Clinton NBC News-Wall Street Journal 5/15-5/19 Clinton +3 Sanders +15 Sanders by 12 CBS News-New York Times 5/13-5/17 Clinton +6 Sanders +13 Sanders by 7 Fox News 5/14-5/17 Trump +3 Sanders +4 Sanders by 7 Public Policy Polling (D) 5/6-5/9 Clinton +6 Sanders +11 Sanders by 5 CNN/ORC 4/28-5/1 Clinton +13 Sanders +16 Sanders by 3 IBD-TIPP 4/22-4/26 Clinton +7 Sanders +12 Sanders by 5 USA Today-Suffolk 4/20-4/24 Clinton +11 Sanders +15 Sanders by 4 GWU-Battleground 4/17-4/20 Clinton +3 Sanders +10 Sanders by 7 So Sanders is correct that he fares better against Trump than Clinton does in every poll over the past six weeks -- more than 6 points better than Clinton, on average. And Sanders is beating Trump by an average of 12 points in these eight polls, so "big numbers" seems like a reasonable description for Sanders to use. Case closed? Not quite, say polling experts. Clinton has been scrutinized and attacked as a public figure for a quarter century, but Sanders -- even after running for president for a year -- is a relatively new figure to voters nationally. So while a lot of voters’ minds are already made up about Clinton based on her long history in the public eye, it remains to be seen how open potential voters will be to supporting Sanders once Republicans start airing negative attacks, especially ones that note his identification as a democratic socialist. (We have previously reported that, according to polls, being a socialist is a less attractive quality for voters than being an atheist.) Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University, told PolitiFact Georgia that Sanders shows up so strongly in head-to-head polls because Trump and Clinton have such high negatives. "General election polls don’t mean much until the conventions are over and you get to late summer or early fall," Swint said. "A lot of voters don’t look at Sanders as a legitimate threat. It’s almost like he’s an imaginary candidate." In addition, early polls do not weed out "likely voters," as polls later in the campaign do, Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political scientist and a specialist in public opinion, told PolitiFact when we previously checked a similar statement by Sanders. This could matter, given Sanders’ high rates of support among college students and younger voters, who have not yet demonstrated a long track record of voting. "If Sanders draws disproportionately from people who are not likely to vote, which is a reasonable speculation at this point, then his support may be somewhat overstated in some comparisons," Smith said. And it’s worth adding that, as Meet the Press host Chuck Todd noted, Clinton can be expected to poll better against Trump after she officially secures the nomination and many former Sanders supporters come to her side. Our ruling Sanders said, "Right now, in every major poll, national poll and statewide poll done in the last month, six weeks, we are defeating Trump often by big numbers, and always at a larger margin than Secretary Clinton is." On the numbers, Sanders is correct: In the past six weeks’ worth of polls, Sanders fares 6 points better against Trump than Clinton does, and he beats Trump by double digits on average. Still, polling experts caution that polls this far away from Election Day are not entirely reliable, and they add that Sanders hasn’t been exposed to the same degree of negative attacks as Clinton has.

pomt-14170	"I was totally against the war in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-iraq-war-destabilize/	When Donald Trump laid out the fundamentals of his foreign policy at a Washington hotel conference room, he offered his go-to proof of sound judgment. "I was totally against the war in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East," he said April 27, 2016. Not in any way we could find. Let’s review the record of what Trump said when about the Iraq War. The war began in March 2003. We searched the Nexis database of transcripts and news reports from 2002 to 2008. From what we found, if Trump saw regional destabilization on the horizon, he kept it under wraps. In a September 2002 interview, shock jock Howard Stern asked Trump if he supported the Iraq invasion. Trump responded, "Yeah, I guess so." That isn’t a ringing endorsement of the war, but Trump did not decry the march toward military action in the way thousands of protesters had been doing for months in 2002. On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, "Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet, and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned." Trump seems to be skeptical of the mission in Iraq here, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything that resembles his claim that Bush should not proceed because a war would "destabilize the Middle East." About a week after the war began, Trump gave a mix of views. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that "the war’s a mess," according to the Washington Post. But he also told Fox News that because of the war, "The market’s going to go up like a rocket." On Sept. 11, 2003, Trump told MSNBC, "It wasn’t a mistake to fight terrorism and fight it hard, and I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq." By 2004, Trump begins to take a tougher stand against the war. (A big hat-tip to Buzzfeed for this.) On April 16, 2004, Trump is back with Stern. "I think Iraq is a terrible mistake," Trump said. "And to think that when we leave, it’s gonna be this nice democratic country. I mean, give me a break. There’s usually a reason why a country is run a certain way." Trump amplified on that in an August 2004 article in Esquire: "Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have. "What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!" In November 2004, he told CNN’s Larry King, "I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out." Clearly Trump opposed the Iraq War in its early years. There’s no evidence, though, that he advocated against the war beforehand, or that he was especially vocal about it destabilizing the Middle East. We reached out to the Trump campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said, "I was totally against the war in Iraq, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East." The record shows at best some early reservations about the war that evolved into opposition about a year after the war began. However, we find no evidence of Trump warning about regional destabilization before or after the war started.

pomt-11020	"39% of All California Students are illegals."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/05/viral-image/no-39-california-students-arent-undocumented/	A viral image on social media -- one that’s critical of illegal immigration -- has been circulating for years. The list of claims first circulated in the form of a chain email in 2006, according to Snopes.com. Six years later, we checked several of the claims ourselves. With immigration in the headlines today, these claims are popular again. In this article, we’ll fact-check No. 6: "39% of All California Students are illegals." According to estimates by Enrico A. Marcelli of San Diego State University and Manuel Pastor of the University of Southern California, only about 3 percent of the child population in California -- defined as those under 18 -- were undocumented immigrants in the period 2008 to 2012. That’s far below the 39 percent suggested by the meme. There’s another way to look at the scope of undocumented immigrants within the California K-12 system -- to look at the percentage of California K-12 students whose parents are unauthorized. According to the Pew Research Center, 12.3 percent of K-12 students in California in 2014 had an unauthorized immigrant parent. This is a broader category -- encompassing parents rather than just students -- but even this doesn’t come close to the meme’s 39 percent figure. It’s worth noting that "the vast majority of children of unauthorized immigrants are U.S. citizens—upwards of 80 percent," said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at Pew Research Center. The 39 percent is "way off," said Manuel Pastor, director of the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at the University of Southern California. Our ruling The viral image said, "39% of All California Students are illegals." That’s well above the most solid estimates we’ve seen. Perhaps 3 percent of students are themselves undocumented, and 12.3 percent have a parent who is undocumented. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14172	Says President Barack Obama never said, "No boots on the ground" in Syria.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/27/john-kirby/has-barack-obama-had-no-boots-ground-message-syria/	On April 25, 2016, President Barack Obama announced that he would be sending an additional 250 special-operations troops to Syria to counter the Islamic extremist group variously known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. "Just as I approved additional support for Iraqi forces against ISIL, I've decided to increase U.S. support for local forces fighting ISIL in Syria, a small number of special operations forces are already on the ground in Syria and their expertise has been critical as local forces have driven ISIL out of key areas," Obama said. This development produced a testy exchange between journalists and State Department spokesman John Kirby at a briefing later that day. Matt Lee of the Associated Press peppered Kirby with questions about whether the expansion of U.S. forces conflicted with Obama’s past pledges to keep U.S. "boots" off the ground in Syria. Kirby said the 50 special operations forces that had already been on the ground "have had a positive impact on our ability to go after Daesh inside Syria. And because it has been successful, we want to intensify. I've stood up here I don't know for how many weeks and talked about the fact that we want to intensify our efforts against Daesh. This is a process which has worked, so the President has decided to increase it to the tune of 250. And there was never this, ‘No boots on the ground.’ I don't know where this keeps coming from." Then Kirby and Lee exchanged disagreements: Lee: "The point is is that for months and months and months the mantra from the president and everyone else in the administration has been, ‘No boots on the ground.’ And now…" Kirby: "No, that is not true." Lee: "What?" Kirby: "It's just not true, Matt." Eventually, Kirby explained why he believed Obama’s past rhetoric is consistent with the new influx of special operations forces. "When we talk about boots on the ground in the context that you have heard people in the administration speak to, we are talking about conventional, large-scale ground troops that are designed to actually engage in, plan, coordinate, integrate, and engage in combat operations on the ground as units," Kirby said. "We're not doing that. We've never done that in Iraq or in Syria, and we're not going to do it now." In a moment, we’ll get to the substance of how one defines "boots on the ground." First, though, we wondered about the accuracy of Kirby’s repeated claim that "there was never this (message), ‘No boots on the ground’ " from Obama. What has Obama said? Obama has certainly used the phrase "no boots on the ground" frequently. On Oct. 31, 2015, USA Today’s Gregory Korte produced a detailed accounting of his comments on the matter headlined, "16 times Obama said there would be no boots on the ground in Syria." We reviewed the 16 examples Korte tracked down and found that in half of them, Obama did provide a fairly thorough set of limitations along the lines of what Kirby cited. For instance, in an address to the nation about Syria on Sept. 10, 2014, Obama said, "I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground." But the other eight examples outlined in USA Today are phrased in such a way that plays up the "no boots on the ground" idea to such an extent that we think a reasonable person would be tempted to downplay or ignore the caveats. For instance, in a statement before meeting with congressional leaders on Sept. 3, 2013, Obama said, "The key point that I want to emphasize to the American people: The military plan that has been developed by our Joint Chiefs, and that I believe is appropriate, is proportional. It is limited. It does not involve boots on the ground. This is not Iraq, and this is not Afghanistan." In an earlier address to the nation on Sept. 10, 2013, Obama said, "Many of you have asked, won't this put us on a slippery slope to another war? One man wrote to me that we are 'still recovering from our involvement in Iraq.' A veteran put it more bluntly: 'This nation is sick and tired of war.' My answer is simple: I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria. I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan. I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo. This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective: deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's capabilities." That address followed an interview with the PBS Newshour the night before in which Obama said, "Tomorrow I'll speak to the American people. I'll explain this is not Iraq; this is not Afghanistan; this is not even Libya. We're not talking about — not boots on the ground. We're not talking about sustained airstrikes. We're talking about a very specific set of strikes to degrade his chemical weapons capabilities in terms of delivery." When we reached out to the White House, they noted that the Syrian conflict at the time of these last two examples was focused on Syria’s chemical-weapons stockpile, rather than ISIS. They also argued that Obama’s main point was that the mission to counter ISIS would be different than the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq which involved more than 100,000 combat troops at a time -- a far larger fighting force than what is being used to target ISIS. Still, we think that the existence of between eight and 16 examples of the "no boots on the ground" phrasing -- sometimes with limitations emphasized, sometimes not -- qualifies as an ongoing "message" from Obama, contrary what Kirby said. "Obama has a credibility gap on this front," said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. "They use the same size body bag for all U.S. troops." What does ‘boots on the ground’ mean? When we checked with international-affairs experts, several agreed that Kirby does have a point that there are legitimate differences between a large combat force and a modest number of special operations forces. "Politicians who say there will be ‘no boots on the ground’ usually attach a caveat, and if they don’t do so verbally, they seem to attach it mentally," said Ted Bromund, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "The caveat is that forces that the politician wishes to employ don’t count as boots on the ground -- which lets them use advisers, special forces, base protection, air power, logistics and supply, and so on to their heart’s content." The risk, Bromund said, comes when someone calls them on it -- as Lee did -- or when the number of forces becomes "so large, so controversial, or so obviously involved in combat that the claim comes into question." What’s unusual in this case, he said, is that Kirby denied that the claim was ever made. Benjamin Friedman, a defense specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the administration could have articulated itself more clearly. Still, he said that the bigger problem is that the administration is "manipulating language to paper over a contradiction. They want ground forces in Syria and Iraq -- special operations forces are ground forces -- and want credit for not sending in ground forces. By saying no ‘boots on the ground,’ whatever caveats you include, you imply that our guys aren’t there getting shot at. But they are. So there’s a fundamental dishonesty there, despite the lawyerly definitional game they’re playing to avoid outright lying." Bromund and Friedman consider this a significant concern. But Michael O’Hanlon, of the Brookings Institution, said he cuts Obama some slack on the language. O’Hanlon said the president’s "obligation is to protect us, not win a contest for perfect semantic consistency. I would rather see slight inconsistencies than dogmatic and stubborn adherence to a soundbite." Our ruling Kirby said that Obama never said, "No boots on the ground" in Syria. We accept that there are legitimate reasons for differentiating between a large ground force and a smaller number of special operations forces. Still, it’s clear that Obama repeatedly used the term "no boots on the ground," sometimes with extensive caveats about what constituted "boots on the ground" and sometimes not. And by repeatedly using that phrase, he reaped the benefits of calming the public about the extent of U.S. involvement. That counts as a message to us.

pomt-14460	Marco Rubio "has the No. 1 absentee record in the United States" Senate.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/03/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-marco-rubio-has-worst-senate-vo/	In a heated exchange, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized rival Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida for his Senate voting record. "This guy has the No. 1 absentee record in the United States (Senate), he doesn't show up to vote," Trump said at the March 3 Fox News debate in Detroit. Trump has trotted out this claim about Rubio multiple times, and we’ve found it to be Mostly True. Let’s revisit the facts. The "most truant" award goes to Rubio if we’re looking at the past year. If we examine career records among the remaining presidential candidates who have served in the Senate, he’s tied with Republican rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Votes missed this past year From March 2015 through March 2016, Rubio has missed 77 of 263 roll call votes, according to GovTrack. Here’s how Rubio stacks up against the other senator-candidates right now: Senator Votes missed (March 5, 2015 to March 3, 2016 Absentee rate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 125 41 percent Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 108 36 percent Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 58 19 percent Rubio’s absentee rate of 41 percent puts him at the 100th percentile, which means that in the past year, he has had a worse voting record than every other sitting senator. In contrast, the Senate median absentee record for the past year is just 1 percent. The majority of the votes Rubio’s skipped came after April 13, when he announced his candidacy, the Tampa Bay Times noted. "It's not unusual for presidential candidates to miss Senate votes," Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon told the Tampa Bay Times. "Sen. Rubio remains fully engaged in the issues important to Florida and helping Floridians, and as he travels the country to talk about his agenda to help the middle class, there will be no doubt where he stands on any important issues before the Senate." Overall attendance Cruz and Rubio, as of March 3, both have a career absentee rate of 14.8 percent. Senator Votes missed (career) Absentee rate Cruz 152 out of 1,026 14.8 percent Rubio 224 out of 1,512 14.8 percent Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y., 2001-2009) 249 out of 2,616 9.5 percent Sanders 131 out of 2,865 4.6 percent But beyond the current field, neither Cruz or Rubio are the worst-ever offenders, according to a May 2015 Washington Post analysis. For example, President Barack Obama missed 24.2 percent of votes in his brief Senate career. And that doesn’t even compare to the most truant senator of all time: Maryon Allen, D-Ala., who racked up a 43.5 percent absentee rate during her five-month stint in the Senate in 1978. Our ruling Trump said Rubio has "the No. 1 absentee record in the United States" Senate. He’s accurate if we look at the number of votes missed this past year. In that time frame, Rubio has missed a higher percentage of votes than any other senator, including those running against him. If we look at career truancy records among the remaining presidential contenders, Rubio and Cruz are tied at 14.8 percent absentee rates. Some former senators have had worse records, including Obama.

pomt-05121	Says "a lip-reading instructor at the River School, a Washington, D.C., school for the deaf" has determined that during 9/11 ceremonies, Michelle Obama said, "All this for a damn flag."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/26/chain-email/river-school-lip-reading-damn-flag-first-lady/	Authors of chain emails love to question President Barack Obama's patriotism. They've said he refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance (False), that he "turns his back to the flag and slouches" (False), and that he complained that U.S. troops were whining about going to war. (Pants on Fire). (We are not including the claim that Obama fits the biblical description of the Antichrist, since it's theoretically possible that you could be the Antichrist and still be patriotic.) We've also noticed a sub-genre of emails that attack First Lady Michelle Obama for living a life of luxury, such as the claim that she ordered $400 worth of caviar and lobster at the Waldorf Astoria in New York (Pants on Fire). Now comes a new twist on a claim that sprouted a year ago in the conservative blogosphere: the suggestion that during 9/11 memorial ceremonies, the first lady could be seen saying to her husband, "All this for a damn flag." The controversy has been fueled by video that shows the first lady saying something to her husband. Because the comments are not audible, critics of the Obamas have speculated about her words. On YouTube, a video that has been seen 1.4 million times slows the exchange and declares the first lady said, "All this for a damn flag" and that the president replied "Hm … mn …. nnnn" and gave a "nod of disapproval." The Blaze, Glenn Beck's website, invited readers to do their own lip reading and speculate what they thought Michelle Obama was saying. The results of the 38,706 votes: "All this for a damn flag." 49 percent "Look at how they fold that damn flag." 5 "Look at how they fold that flag." 22 Something else, but I'm not sure. 7 Come on, there's no way to tell. 17 The new email, which emerged about one month ago, indicates Michelle Obama's words have been confirmed by "a lip-reading instructor at the River School, a Washington school for the deaf." Here's the full email (it has two subject lines because senders added a second line when forwarding it):: Subject: Obama's wife - Caught in the Act You be the judge, How much more disrespect can there be? Subject: Obama's wife as seen by deaf people READING HER LIPS !! Obama and his wife were attending The 9/11 Memorial Ceremony and watched as the Color Guard folded the flag into a triangular shape, according to custom. A video camera caught the two from the sidelines. Obama's wife leaned over and said to him, "All this for a damn flag?" Obama turned to her, smiled smugly and nodded his head in agreement. How do we know what was said? The video was presented for translation to a lip reading instructor at The River School, a Washington D.C. school for the deaf. The video is shown at normal speed, 3/4 speed, and 1/2 speed with no banners obstructing her lips. The current Commander and Chief and the First Lady proud of being American? You be the judge... Like many chain emails, this one has evolved since earlier versions. The detail about the lip-reading instructor at the River School was added recently, presumably to give the email more credibility. But that credibility crumbled when we spoke with Nancy Mellon, director of the River School. She described it as a Washington school that serves a wide range of children from 18 months to third grade. It is known for its strong program for hearing-impaired children, but they account for just 15 percent of the students. More importantly, the River School doesn't teach lip-reading, Mellon said, and no one from the faculty has provided any interpretation of the video. "It's definitely not us," she said. "We would never try to do anything like this." The school has gotten so many inquiries about the chain email that last week it posted this message on its website: Please be advised that The River School was not involved in any translation services for a recent video clip currently circulating on the Internet. So what did she really say? The consensus on All Deaf, a website for people who are hearing impaired, was that she said, "It's amazing how they fold that flag." (However, one person speculated that she told her husband, "This is the third time this week you left your underwear on the floor... I ain't your mother.") Our ruling Like many chain emails we've checked, this one is so flimsy that it needs to fabricate its credibility. Critics of Obama are free to speculate about the first lady's words, but the "damn flag" translation was not done by anyone at the River School. So we give this one a nod of disapproval -- and a Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2012-06-26T12:34:13	2012-06-26	['Washington,_D.C.', 'Michelle_Obama']

pomt-09678	The McCain campaign "did not elaborate" on Obama's ties to ACORN.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/17/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-claims-campaign-did-not-elaborate-obam/	In her book Going Rogue , Sarah Palin laments her campaign not hitting harder on Barack Obama's relationship with ACORN. "On the campaign trail many had been hesitant to talk about legitimate fears that Obama's past comments and associations with anti-capitalist radicals would influence his economic policy," Palin wrote. "The press gave the impression it was the wrong thing to do. I was 'going rogue" when I answered reporters' questions about candidate Obama's associations and pals. I wish we had talked more about them, and about Obama's close relationship with ACORN, the voter-fraud specialists. But we did not elaborate on any of that during the campaign." That didn't jibe with our recollections from covering the campaign. So we did a quick search of our e-mail inbox to refresh our memory. Here's some -- but not all - of what we got from the McCain-Palin campaign: Oct. 10, 2008 : MEMO: Barack Obama & ACORN This is a memo from the McCain-Palin campaign that begins, "Today, the McCain campaign outlined the intimate and longstanding relationship between Barack Obama and the Association of Community Organizers for Reform Now (ACORN). Given ACORN’s recent efforts to engage in voter fraud and to disrupt our political system, Obama’s affiliation with this group raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to lead this nation." It goes on to highlight Obama's efforts directing Project Vote in 1992 as well as his work as a lawyer handling a case for ACORN. (We took a look at a few of the claims from Republicans about Obama's alleged ties to ACORN and found some were more legitimate than others .) Oct. 10, 2008 : McCain-Palin 2008 Launches New Web Ad : "ACORN" The ad describes Obama as a man with vast ambition whose "ties to ACORN run long and deep. He taught classes for ACORN. They even endorsed him for president." The ad also accuses the Obama campaign of paying more than $800,000 to an ACORN front for get-out-the-vote efforts. "Too risky for America," the ad concludes. Oct. 11, 2008 : All: Please see statement by McCain-Palin spokesman Michael Goldfarb on Barack Obama and ACORN In it, Goldfarb responds to a statement from the Obama campaign the previous week that "Barack Obama never organized with ACORN." Goldfarb repeats many of the same ties alleged before, adding "he and unrepentant terrorist William Ayers funneled nearly $200,000 (to ACORN) from the Woods Foundation." Says Goldfarb: "It is clear that Barack Obama is not being honest about his association with ACORN, just as he has not been honest about his association with unrepentant terrorist William Ayers." Oct. 15, 2008 : Subject: Obama Misleads on ACORN Tonight This is the campaign's "fact-check" based on a statement made by Obama during a debate with McCain, that "The only involvement I've had with ACORN is, I represented them alongside the US justice department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs." The response, sent by Brian Rogers of the McCain campaign, includes five points highlighting the "full extent" of Obama's relationship with ACORN. Oct. 16, 2008 : All: Please see statement by campaign manager Rick Davis on FBI investigation of ACORN. An excerpt from the statement: "To date, in public announcements including last night's debate, Barack Obama has attempted to conceal and distort his and his campaign's relationship with a group that is currently engaging in systematic voter fraud. Barack Obama's campaign must fully disclose the true nature of his association with ACORN, including: · The total disclosure of all funds, including $832,000 from Barack Obama's campaign to ACORN and ACORN affiliations like Citizens Services, Inc. · Any and all information the Obama campaign has related to ACORN's database of registered voters compiled during this election cycle. · The total disclosure of coordination between Barack Obama's campaign, ACORN, and ACORN affiliations over the entirety of this election cycle. · The truth behind ACORN's hiring of get-out-the-vote workers on Barack Obama's behalf in Ohio during this election cycle." Oct. 17, 2008: All: Please join us for a conference call at 11:30am ET with campaign manager Rick Davis to discuss Barack Obama's association with ACORN and the nationwide investigation of ACORN's practices. Oct. 30, 2008 : Press release: McCain-Palin 2008 will hold a press conference call with Rick Davis, McCain-Palin 2008 Campaign Manager, to discuss the true extent of Barack Obama's relationship with ACORN and yesterday's sworn testimony of a former ACORN employee. In addition to these e-mails, we note that McCain three times raised the issue of Obama's alleged ties to ACORN during the third presidential debate on Oct. 15. Said McCain: "We need to know the full extent of Sen. Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for 'lighting and site selection.' So all of these things need to be examined, of course." And then later: "Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN." And lastly: "All of the details need to be known about Sen. Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment." In her book, Palin says she wishes the campaign had talked more about "Obama's close relationship with ACORN. ... But we did not elaborate on any of that during the campaign." So let's recap. The McCain-Palin campaign: sent out a memo to the media detailing Obama's alleged ties to ACORN; launched a Web ad about it; released several statements from campaign staffers; sent out "fact-checks" about it after a debate; held media conference calls with campaign staff to discuss it; issued several press releases about it; and McCain mentioned the issue several times during a debate. That sounds like a lot of elaborating to us. We rule Palin's statement False.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2009-11-17T16:48:27	2009-11-17	['Barack_Obama', 'John_McCain']

pomt-08359	"Your tellers were paid kickbacks for directing elderly consumers from ... safe deposits to risky ones."	true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/26/rick-scott/alex-sink-faces-her-own-fraud-charges-cnnst-peters/	One of the most heated exchanges between Rick Scott and Alex Sink at their third and final gubernatorial debate on Oct. 25, 2010, centered on fraud. But it was Sink, not Scott, in the hot seat. After Sink brought up Scott's time running Columbia/HCA and the hospital company's convictions and $1.7 billion in fines for defrauding Medicare and Medicaid, Scott turned the tables on the former bank executive. "Look, you want to talk about fraud. Let's talk about your job at NationsBank," Scott said. "Your tellers were paid kickbacks, your tellers in your bank were paid kickbacks for directing elderly consumers from ..." Scott stopped in mid-thought because he saw Sink smiling. "You want to smile about it?" Scott asked. "Am I going to have an opportunity to respond?" Sink turned and asked the moderators, CNN's John King and the St. Petersburg Times' Adam C. Smith. But before King or Smith could answer, Scott pressed on. "Let me finish and make sure you understand what the issue is. Your tellers were paid kickbacks -- OK. Your tellers were paid kickbacks for -- OK, you think it's funny for these seniors that you sent from safe deposits to risky ones," Scott said. "All right, you were sued -- your bank was sued and you paid fines. That's called fraud. So I have a whole list -- you want to talk about fraud, I can give you a list of them." We've examined in detail Scott's time and role in the fraud investigation at Columbia/HCA, so we thought it fair to delve into Sink's banking background, and the allegations of fraud at NationsBank -- which is now Bank of America. Sink, the state chief financial officer, is a banker by profession. She came to Florida in 1989 and became president of NationsBank Florida in November 1993. She served in that role until early 1998, when she became president of the bank's private client group. In 2000, NationsBank merged with Bank of America. Sink left Bank of America that same year in an executive shake-up. The roots of the allegations Scott is talking about stretch back to 1994 and originate in Florida. That year, a stockbroker with a NationsBank subsidiary, NationsSecurities, went public with what he described as an orchestrated nationwide scheme to get bank customers to move investments from safe, federally insured accounts to more risky brokerage and mutual funds. Florida-based NationsSecurities broker David Cray said the bank and its securities arm intentionally blurred the lines between its traditional banking business and its securities business and misled customers into thinking those securities investments were protected by the bank or the federal government. The scheme permeated the entire bank, Cray, and later others, said. Brokers were given sales scripts to try to convince bank customers to move their money into more risky securities. A NationsSecurities senior manager said employees should use the phrase "SPR" which stood for "safety, predictability and return" when discussing the mutual funds, according to the findings of a subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. A sales script the company used said the investments provided "certainty in an uncertain world," and NationsSecurities branch managers also encouraged employees to "use fear to sell" securities. In one orientation sales meeting, a manager suggested that a broker could ask customers: "Is this your risky money or safe money? If this is risky, I know a guy at Merrill or Dean Witter." NationsBank helped NationsSecurities by providing brokers lists of customers with Certificates of Deposit about to mature, according to the SEC's findings. Why was the bank pushing the mutual fund investments and its securities side business? According to Cray and others, NationsBank received lucrative fees for the mutual funds its subsidiary managed. The allegations led to a class-action lawsuit against NationsBank of Florida, NationsSecurities and others, from investors who lost money by unknowingly making the risky investments, which in the end lost money. Along with the SEC, the Department of Justice also opened an investigation. The results of those investigations support Scott's claim that bank tellers were being paid for referring customers to the securities side of the business. The SEC concluded that NationsBank tellers were provided incentives to refer customers to NationsSecurities stock brokers. If the NationsSecurities broker got a customer to buy into the mutual fund, the teller who made the referral would receive a 5 percent commission. "In some instances, bank employees substantially increased their monthly compensation during this period by making referrals to NationsSecurities," the SEC found. The SEC fined NationsSecurities $4 million in 1998 for its role in misleading bank customers. NationsBank ended up paying civil fines of $6.4 million and $6.75 million to the federal government in 2000 and 2002, and another $8.1 million to 2,230 investors nationwide. No criminal charges in the case were filed, according to the St. Petersburg Times. We should note, that despite Scott's suggestion, the scheme wasn't crafted solely for elderly customers. The investments were sold as being safe for anyone, including the elderly, brokers were told to say. The Securities and Exchange Commission did find, however, that more than half of the eventual investors were over 60. Sink said she had nothing to do with the mutual fund scheme. The companies NationsBank and NationsSecurities were managed separately, though NationsBank allowed NationsSecurities representatives to sit in desks at bank lobbies where they would appear to look like bank employees. Sink also says the lawyer who brought the class-action lawsuit would back up her story. We explored that claim in another item, which you can read here. But in this case, we're drilling down on what Scott said. He said that Sink's "tellers were paid kickbacks for directing elderly consumers from ... safe deposits to risky ones." While Sink was state president of NationsBank, bank tellers in Florida were being paid a 5 percent commission for directing bank customers to bank-related stock brokers. The stock brokers were then selling riskier investments under the guise that they were protected either by the bank or the federal government. We rate this claim is True.

pomt-07101	"Two thirds of the people in Wisconsin strongly disagree with this idea of permanently taking away people’s rights to collective bargaining."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/22/peter-barca/assembly-minority-leader-peter-barca-says-two-thir/	On the night the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the sharp limits on public-sector collective bargaining, Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha) denounced the move. Barca told a national cable TV audience on June 14, 2011 that the plan advocated by Gov. Scott Walker and passed by his Republican colleagues in the Legislature was wildly unpopular in Wisconsin. "Two thirds of the people in Wisconsin strongly disagree with this idea of permanently taking away people’s rights to collective bargaining," Barca told Ed Schultz, the liberal host of MSNBC’s "The Ed Show." Like others, Barca is closely watching public reaction to the GOP move -- particularly now that nine recall elections spurred by the legislative battle could tip control of the Senate from the Republicans to Democrats. Back in February and March, during the heat of the battle, Walker was coming out on the short end in many surveys released iby independent and politically connected groups. But a two-thirds majority against the GOP plan? And not just opposed, but strongly opposed, which is a narrower category used by pollsters? When we asked Barca to back up his two-thirds claim, he pointed to polls by USA Today/Gallup and Bloomberg National, as well as surveys conducted for the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative Wisconsin think tank, and for the AFL-CIO and a liberal group, Building a Stronger Wisconsin. Some reach two-thirds opposition, and others get there if you add in the margin of error, said Melanie Conklin, Barca’s spokesperson. First, a note of caution. There are great variations in the way questions on polls are worded and the group that is measured (all adults, likely voters, etc.) and the scope of the poll (state, national). Results can be influenced timing, and some are done by groups with a stake in the fight. Thus, for Barca to be on the money, he has to be accurately describing what the polls asked as well as the numerical results. We’ll look at the polls Barca cited, as well as others made public at the time. We’ll start with polls that were unaffiliated with the players in the controversy. USA Today/Gallup: The USA Today/Gallup poll released Feb. 22, 2011 asked adults across the country if they favored Wisconsin-style bargaining limits in their state. A total of 61 percent opposed such limits, 33 percent favored them. But that number was not Wisconsin specific. Bloomberg: The Bloomberg National Poll released March 9, 2011 found that 64 percent of Americans think public employee unions should have the right to collectively bargain for wages. This poll also was national in scope. Another issue: That poll frames the question around support for collective bargaining for wages. The Wisconsin plan limits how much wages can increase, but does not eliminate bargaining on wages. So, it’s not clear how that poll question backs Barca’s claim. Now let’s take a look at the surveys by organizations either working for one of the players, or often tagged as having partisan or ideological leanings. Barca cited two questions on the poll from the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative group. That poll, conducted in late February and early March, focused on Wisconsin adults. In one question, 65 percent of respondents thought Walker should compromise and negotiate with Democrats and labor rather than stand strong, the poll found. In the other, 60 percent opposed a specific compromise. But neither of those is directly on point to Barca’s statement. We found a question that was closer: It found 51 percent opposed to Walker’s plan, which the poll described as reducing employee benefits, limiting bargaining rights and changing rules to make unions do more work to remain certified and collect dues. Another 46 percent favored the governor’s ideas. Another poll cited by Barca, conducted for the state AFL-CIO found that among Wisconsin likely voters, 67 percent agreed with position taken by public employees in the dispute. That’s the two-thirds mark – but it doesn’t mean that only one-third agreed with Walker. Respondents in the poll were not asked to choose one side or the other; rather they were asked to rate whether they agreed with the position of each of several individuals or groups. Walker’s position won 43 percent approval, and Republicans in the Legislature, 48 percent. We found a larger poll for the labor organization asked a detailed question that focused directly on Walker’s plan. The response: 52 percent were opposed (Of that, 41 percent were strongly opposed). The final poll cited by Barca was one done for the liberal group Building a Stronger Wisconsin. That statewide poll of likely voters was conducted by The Shop Consulting Inc., a Madison-based firm that polls for liberal and Democratic clients. It found 65 percent of state voters opposed stripping employees of most of their collective bargaining rights. Based on our review, that was the high water mark for the pro-union side. We also found two Wisconsin polls of likely voters, conducted by Rasmussen Reports, an electronic media company. One poll found 52 percent opposed weakening collective bargaining rights of state employees. A second poll, also in March, found 57 percent against weakening those rights. Rasmussen has been criticized by Democrats as a GOP-leaning firm, but it describes itself as independent and does not do commissioned polling for partisan groups. University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist Charles Franklin, a nationally recognized polling expert, said the lack of recent polls and relative dearth of state-specific polls made hard-and-fast conclusions difficult. But he said the consistency of the various polls -- he has compiled a list -- is pretty good evidence that the ceiling for opposition is in the upper 50 percent range to 60 percent. He called a two-thirds claim of opposition a stretch and Barca’s claim that two-thirds "strongly" disapprove an even bigger one. Franklin expressed mixed feelings about The Shop Consulting Poll that found 65 percent opposition. It has to be taken into account, he said, but is an outlier in its finding. Franklin noted it was not an independent poll, though he did credit the group for releasing the survey questions. But he argued that the setup question tilted anti-Walker by starting off, "Rather than negotiate with public employees..." Lance Walter, co-founder of Shop Consulting, defended the fairness of the polland noted the lead-in was factual. It’s crucial to note that Barca set the bar even higher than general opposition of two-thirds. He said two-thirds "strongly" oppose the change. The WPRI poll had 42 percent "strongly" opposed to Walker’s plan and 9 percent "somewhat" opposed. And the poll for the AFL-CIO measured the "strongly opposed" group at 41 percent. The poll for Building a Stronger Wisconsin did not break out a category for strongly opposed. So, let’s return to the claim at hand. Barca said "two thirds of the people in Wisconsin strongly disagree with this idea of permanently taking away people’s rights to collective bargaining." To be sure, the polls showed general opposition. But Barca has scant evidence of a two-thirds majority (some of the polls he cites are national ones), and no leg to stand on in claiming two thirds of Wisconsinites "strongly disagreed." That’s a specific measure pollsters use. In polling, a few percentage points either way can be highly significant. Here, Barca missed the bull's-eye by more than that. We find his statement False.

pomt-14481	Says he supported the 1994 crime bill because "there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/28/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-chuck-todd-debate-crime-bill-vote-a/	Bernie Sanders defended his vote supporting the 1994 crime bill during an interview on Meet the Press. Both he and Hillary Clinton have been criticized for their support of the legislation, which some say helped usher in the era of mass incarceration and decimate black communities. Sanders has pushed back, saying he only voted for the bill because of key safety provisions. The Sanders campaign offered the defense when we asked about it in September and in a recent press release. But that doesn’t add up, Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd pointed out on Feb. 28. "You said you supported the House version of crime bill because it had an assault weapons ban in it. But that turned out not to be the case," Todd said. "So why did you put out a statement that was misleading?" "Woah, woah, woah," Sanders responded. "No, that’s not my understanding. My understanding is there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill." "It was not in the House bill that you voted. It was in a Senate bill, but not the House bill," Todd countered. "Hold it. To the best of my knowledge, there were two important provisions, and that is the Violence Against Women Act," Sanders said. "And my understanding is there is a ban on assault weapons." So who’s right here? The answer is complicated. Sanders did vote in favor of a House conference report that included the aforementioned ban and protections for women. He also voted for a separate House bill specifically prohibiting assault weapons that was meant to be folded into the omnibus legislation. But it’s a stretch to say that Sanders supported the crime bill because of the assault weapons ban, so Todd is right that Sanders also okayed versions without the prohibitions. Sanders and the crime bill The crime bill underwent many iterations before it became law in August 1994. So it’s not entirely clear if Sanders and Todd are talking about the same version. But here’s the bottom line. Sanders voted for at least one version of the bill that didn’t include the assault weapons ban -- undercutting his core claim. The crime bill had a circuitous path. In 1991, Sanders opposed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1991 — an early version of the 1994 bill put forth by Jack Brooks, a Democrat from Texas and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Though the bill passed in the House, it ultimately failed in the Senate. In October 1993, Brooks tried again and introduced the original Violent Crime and Control Law Enforcement Act of 1994. This version didn’t include an assault weapons ban nor protections for women. It passed in the House by a voice vote on Nov. 3, 1993, so it’s unclear whether Sanders voted in favor. We found no evidence Sanders opposed the bill, and in three roll call votes, Sanders, along with most Democrats, said "aye" to amendments that didn’t include a ban. When the bill reached the Senate, it added provisions to ban assault weapons and protect women from crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence. This version passed in the Senate and returned to the House. At that point, two things happened. First, Sanders criticized the crime bill for its lack of attention to root causes. "We can either educate or electrocute. We can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails. Mr. Speaker, let us create a society of hope and compassion, not one of hate and vengeance," he said on the House floor on April 13. Second, Brooks amended the bill again, this time stripping the legislation of the assault weapons ban but keeping the violence against women provisions. Sanders voted for the bill without the gun ban. In place of the ban, Brooks offered to create a commission to "examine the extent to which assault weapons and high power firearms have contributed to violence and murder in the United States." Then the bill went back and forth between the two chambers for a few months, as a conference committee attempted to hash out the differences. Meanwhile, the assault weapons ban became a hot topic in the national debate, with three former presidents — Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan — writing a letter urging Congress to pass it. In May, Sanders voted for a separate bill put forth by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer to ban 19 semi-automatic assault weapons, including AK-47s and Uzis as well as weapons with more than one assault feature. According to news reports from the time, passing this legislation paved the way for the compromise bill to encompass the ban. Brooks, the Texas Democrat described by the Washington Post as "wily and contrary," attempted to keep the prohibitions out of the bill but to no avail. The House released its conference report in August 1994 with the ban in place. Sanders voted in agreement. Sanders on banning assault weapons Outside of the omnibus crime bill, the record shows that Sanders supported prohibiting assault weapons since his early days in office. In 1990, the Miami Herald noted that Sanders had earned the backing of the gun community in his congressional bid over Republican Peter Smith, even though "Sanders also supports federal limits on assault weapons." But in 1994, his vote on the Schumer bill roused the ire of Vermont gun owners. Here’s a passage from the Boston Globe to that point: "Sanders, who always supported an assault weapons ban, joined Swett and Andrews in the 216-214 House majority to ban 19 types of semiautomatic guns — which require the trigger to be pulled each time the gun is fired but have high rates of fire and magazines that hold more than 10 cartridges. ‘We're going to put our complete and entire effort to unseat him,’ said Douglas Hoffman, president of a pro-gun group, the Sportsman's Alliance for Vermont's Environment, of Sanders." In 1996, Sanders reconfirmed his support of the ban, voting to reject its appeal. Our ruling Sanders says he voted for the 1994 crime bill because "there is a ban on assault weapons in that bill." There were many votes surrounding the crime bill. The trouble with Sanders’ claim is that his contention that he voted for the crime bill because of the assault weapons ban is at odds with votes for the bill that include no such ban. As often with congressional votes, there is a lot of gray area to determining a legislator’s motivations. We rate Sanders’ claim Half True.

pomt-15368	Six thousand people have sought addiction treatment through expanded Medicaid.	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/jul/02/maggie-hassan/hassan-says-6000-people-expanded-medicaid-have-sou/	When New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan gave her state of the state address in Nashua she took time to address two priorities. One of them was extending authorization of the state’s expanded Medicaid program, which is set to wind down at the start of 2017. The other was adding resources for those struggling with drug and alcohol addiction. The two came together in one sentence from the speech. Hassan told the crowd that, "our bipartisan health care expansion plan provides coverage for treatment for substance and alcohol abuse, and 6,000 people have already accessed services for substance misuse through this program." That’s a remarkable number, given that in the same speech and news accounts, the overall number of those enrolled in the expanded Medicaid program is about 40,000. Given Hassan’s numbers, that means about 15 percent had sought treatment for drug or alcohol issues. That would be a pretty hefty number, and would signify both a widespread problem and evidence that people are seeking and receiving treatment. Is she right? We decided to check it out. Drug abuse in New Hampshire But first, let’s look at some background on the problem. In 2014, 325 people in the state died from overdoses. That was a record, and it led to new laws this legislative session. As the Concord Monitor reported earlier this month, "senators passed a bill ... giving limited criminal immunity to people who report overdoses. Gov. Maggie Hassan signed a law last week expanding public access to the life-saving drug Narcan, an antidote to heroin overdoses." Members of the Executive Council are on board too. "There’s no question that we need to continue to support, and frankly do more, when it comes to substance abuse issues and addiction issues in New Hampshire," Democratic Councilor Colin Van Ostern told the Associated Press on Wednesday. It’s also true that addicts in New Hampshire haven’t previously sought treatment in large numbers. Tym Rourke, the chairman of the Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, Intervention and Treatment, laid out the challenge in an education session for lawmakers in May 2014. At the time, Rourke said that about about 5 percent of all New Hampshire residents struggling with addiction got help, the Monitor reported. "In the United States, if you have a substance abuse disorder, the only other state where you are less likely to get help is Texas," he said. So experts agree that there is a need in the state: People with drug problems are dying, and relatively few of them are seeking treatment. But do they amount to 6,000 of 40,000 new Medicaid enrollees? A closer look at the numbers When we reached out to Hassan’s spokesman, William Hinkle, he admitted that the number was actually incorrect. "This number came from information that HHS presented to the substance use disorder benefit providers. At the time, HHS had said roughly 6,000 people had accessed substance misuse services under expansion and nearly 2,000 had accessed mental health services," Hinkle wrote. "However, those numbers were inverted and the opposite was the case." We reached out to the state Department of Health and Human Services, and Director of Communications Jake Leon gave us the official numbers. -- 1,800 different people used drug and alcohol treatment services from Sept. 1, 2014, to March 31. -- 9,000 different people used mental health services over that same period. "The numbers were accidentally swapped at some point," Leon wrote in an email. "It was an honest but unfortunate mistake." Of course, the numbers weren’t simply reversed. If so, Hassan would have reported that 9,000 different people received substance abuse treatment. This wasn’t the case. Hinkle emphasized that the numerical error doesn’t undercut the governor’s point. "The underlying point remains true," Hinkle said. "Thousands of people have accessed coverage for these services under the bipartisan expansion plan." When Hassan appeared at the Monitor on June 24 to talk about her plans to veto the Legislature’s budget, she used a talking point that had been revised from her Nashua speech. Now, rather than saying 6,000 had sought treatment, she merely said "thousands." Peter Evers, the CEO of Riverbend Community Mental Health in Concord, said that he absolutely agreed with the governor's point. If anything, he wrote in an email, more people need help than are receiving it. "The need is absolutely there. The complication here is that substance misuse has such a stigma to it that it is hard for people to reach out, and getting young people into treatment is hard when they are in what is called the 'pre-contemplative' stage of the problem, (when) they are not aware that they have a problem," Evers wrote. Our ruling In her state of the state address, Hassan said that "6,000 people have already accessed services for substance misuse" through the state’s Medicaid program. There is no question that substance abuse in the state is a real and pressing problem, and the statistics show that thousands have sought help as a result of the state’s expanded Medicaid program. But Hassan offered (and later corrected) a number that simply wasn’t accurate. The real total is closer to 2,000 -- about one-third the amount she cited. We rate her claim False.

pomt-15019	Birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger "believed that people like me should be eliminated."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/oct/05/ben-carson/did-margaret-sanger-believe-african-americans-shou/	Despite being dead for 49 years, Margaret Sanger, founder of the organization that became Planned Parenthood, has a way of turning up in the news. Her latest appearance came during remarks by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson at a retirement center in Exeter, N.H. Answering a question at RiverWoods Retirement Community, Carson said that "Planned Parenthood, as you know, was founded by Margaret Sanger. . . . Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist. She believed that people like me should be eliminated, or kept under control." At a press conference later, he specified what he meant by "people like me." He said he was "talking about the black race." Claims like this have been examined by PolitiFact before. Back in March, New Hampshire Rep. William O’Brien claimed Sanger was an "an active participant in the Ku Klux Klan." That claim was rated false. And in 2011, businessman and GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain said Planned Parenthood’s early mission was to "help kill black babies before they came into the world." That statement was rated Pants on Fire. Carson’s statement pulls on the same threads. Sanger was indeed a believer in eugenics, but the basic concept that humanity could be improved by selective breeding was an article of faith for many in the years before World War II. Winston Churchill, Herbert Hoover, Theodore Roosevelt, George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells all supported the movement. African-American leader W. E. B. Du Bois backed many of its principles as well. Although the eugenics movement included some who had racist ideas, wanting to create some sort of master race, "only a minority of eugenicists" ever believed this, according to Ruth Engs, professor emerita at the Indiana University School of Public Health and an expert in the movement. At the time that Sanger was active, Engs wrote, "the purpose of eugenics was to improve the human race by having people be more healthy through exercise, recreation in parks, marriage to someone free from sexually transmitted diseases, well-baby clinics, immunizations, clean food and water, proper nutrition, non-smoking and drinking." It’s a far cry to equate eugenics with advocating the elimination of black people. For Sanger, her ideas were a matter a public health. As late as 1957, she put her views this way in an interview with Mike Wallace: "I think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world -- that have disease from their parents, that have no chance in the world to be a human being practically. Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things just marked when they're born. That to me is the greatest sin -- that people can -- can commit." Sanger was indeed a birth control activist, which means that she wanted women to be able to avoid unwanted pregnancies. She worked for women of all classes and races to have that choice, which she believed to be a right. Quoted in an article about the false accusation that Sanger supported the Ku Klux Klan (she merely addressed a women’s auxiliary and later compared them to children because of their mental simplicity), Jean H. Baker, author of Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion, said Sanger actually opposed prejudice. Sanger "was far ahead of her times in terms of opposing racial segregation," wrote Baker, a history professor at Goucher College, in an email. She worked closely with black leaders to open birth control clinics in Harlem and elsewhere." Even authors who treat Sanger critically don’t believe she held negative views about African-Americans. Edwin Black wrote a comprehensive history of the eugenics movement, War Against the Weak, and is no fan of the activist’s beliefs. Ultimately, though, he writes, "Sanger was no racist. Nor was she anti-Semitic." It’s also worth noting that Sanger died in 1966, six years before the Supreme Court established a nationwide right to abortion services in Roe v. Wade. Those who point a finger at Sanger as a racist often cite a particular statement in claiming she harbored ill will toward black people. In a Dec. 10, 1939, letter, she wrote that "We don’t want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs." But PolitFact Georgia debunked those who would read the statement as something sinister. "Sanger’s correspondence shows this sentence advocates for black doctors and ministers to play leadership roles in the Negro Project to avoid misunderstandings. Lynchings and Jim Crow laws gave blacks good reason to be wary of attempts to limit the number of children they bore. In Harlem, she hired a black doctor and social worker to quell those fears," the article says. She attracted an impressive roster of supporters, including DuBois; Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of National Council of Negro Women; and the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. Eleanor Roosevelt also backed the effort. "For Sanger to launch a genocidal plot behind their backs and leave no true evidence in her numerous writings would require powers just shy of witchcraft," the PolitiFact piece notes. Finally, in 1966 Planned Parenthood gave its Margaret Sanger award to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader accepted, and sent his wife, Coretta, to accept. The speech he wrote for the occasion stated that ""There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts." Sanger was still alive at that point, and her history and statements were well known (she had published an autobiography in 1938 and was never shy about sharing her opinions). If she had, in fact, been a supporter of eliminating black people, it’s doubtful King would have accepted that award. Our ruling Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said that birth control activist Margaret Sanger "believed that people like me should be eliminated." He later clarified that he meant African-Americans. While Sanger indeed supported the eugenics movement, substantial evidence shows that she was not racist and in fact worked closely with black leaders and health care professionals. Carson’s statement bears no relation to historical reality. We rate the claim False.

pomt-12663	"There's no demonstrable evidence they (after-school programs that feed kids) are helping kids do better at school."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/21/mick-mulvaney/wh-budget-chief-wrongly-claims-afterschool-program/	White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney triggered a storm of complaints when he defended elimination of a large federal after-school program. When asked in a press conference about the impact on students in Pennsylvania, Mulvaney couched his answer as pertaining to "after-school programs generally." "They're supposed to be educational programs, right," he said March 16. "That's what they're supposed to do, they're supposed to help kids who can't -- who don't get fed at home, get fed so that they do better at school. Guess what? There's no demonstrable evidence they're actually doing that. There's no demonstrable evidence they're actually helping results, helping kids do better at school." President Donald Trump’s budget zeros out the $1.2 billion for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program that helps fund after-school and summer programs in disadvantaged communities around the country. We wondered what the research shows. Is there evidence programs like this help academically? The answer is a qualified yes. Improvements in test scores can be modest, and results vary from place to place. Also, as you might expect, the kids who actually come every day do better than those who don’t. California commissioned the UCLA Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing to do a detailed analysis of that state’s program. The center’s 2012 report found that among high school students "participation had a slightly positive but minor effect on English language arts and math California Standards Test scores." How minor? Students who took advantage of the afterschool program on average had scores a few points higher than a control group (matched according to a number of characteristics). Researchers called the results statistically significant but "substantively weak." For younger children, from kindergarten through eighth grade, the center’s research found the program boosted test scores only for the students who came regularly. For those who rarely showed up, there was no benefit. Deborah La Torre, a research associate at the UCLA center, told us food is an incidental part of these programs, and she called Mulvaney’s description "muddled." In California, the kids must get a "healthy snack." "None of the programs just provide food," La Torre said. "That’s not what they are about. They are mandated to provide specific academic programs in math and English, to help with homework and offer other programs such as art or physical fitness." The Texas Education Agency also brought in an outside group to assess its federally funded afterschool program. Similarly to the California study, researchers found "program participation was associated with higher Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills scores in reading/English language arts and mathematics." But the benefits in Texas also mirrored California in that they were "primarily in the small to moderate range." Mulvaney’s focus on food puzzled other experts in this field, including Ken Springer at Southern Methodist University’s School of Education. "Mr. Mulvaney's phrase ‘doing better in school’ leads somewhat narrowly to the question of whether better nutrition fosters better grades and test scores," Springer told us. "It does, but when we focus specifically on better nutrition provided by afterschool programs, there's evidence that these programs can have other benefits, such as positively impacting students' knowledge about nutrition as well as their eating habits." Springer said, and we confirmed, that there are many studies that affirm the educational benefits of feeding children from low-income families breakfast and lunch. Education researchers also emphasize that test scores alone are not the only measure of impact. Reduced absenteeism and better odds of moving up to the next grade are also linked to afterschool programs. We made several requests for information from the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. We did not hear back. Our ruling Mulvaney said that there is no evidence that federally funded afterschool programs that feed students help kids do better in school. Two studies from two of the largest states, California and Texas, found modest but positive impacts on test scores. They also found other gains, such as better attendance at school and better odds of moving up to the next grade. Mulvaney made a strong assertion that there is no evidence of gains. There is, even if test scores only rise a little bit. We rate this claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Mick Mulvaney	None	None	None	2017-03-21T10:17:55	2017-03-16	['None']

pomt-14640	"Since John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, more Americans have died by gunfire within our own country than American servicemen and women who were killed in all our wars."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/jan/26/virginia-center-public-safety/gun-control-group-says-more-americans-have-died-fi/	During a recent rally at Capitol Square in Richmond, gun control advocates handed out fliers with a grisly statistic. "Since John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, more Americans have died by gunfire within our own country than American servicemen and women who were killed in all our wars," says the brochure, distributed on Jan. 18 by the Virginia Center for Public Safety. The claim is familiar to PolitiFact; it’s been vetted by our colleagues in the national office twice over the years. We decided to take a new look through the lens of the latest available data. War casualties The most comprehensive list we found on U.S. war dead was compiled in January 2015 by the Congressional Research Service. It included casualties from the Revolutionary War through Operation Inherent Resolve, which is targeting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria. The number of U.S. dead in all those conflicts comes to nearly 1.2 million, according to the research service. We should add a qualifier here: The research service says that during the Civil War, the nation’s deadliest conflict, Union and Confederate losses combined were 525,000 to 530,000. But a 2012 study by a Binghamton University historian estimated the combined toll was much higher -- about 750,000. If we use that higher Civil War figure, it would bring the total U.S. deaths in military conflicts to about 1.4 million. Gun deaths The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a series of hard figures and estimates of yearly gunfire deaths in the U.S. from 1968 to 2014. They add up to about 1.5 million fatalities. The Virginia Center for Public Safety’s claim on gun deaths goes back a little bit further, to 1963. We couldn’t find figures going back to that year, since the oldest year for which data were available was 1968. A CDC chart shows 24,000 gun deaths occurred that year. With that in mind, the figure of 1.5 million deaths since November 1963 surely is an underestimate of the level of gun violence since then, because it excludes four years. The actual number probably is close to 1.6 million. A key thing to know about these figures: They include not just murders but all gun deaths. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun deaths were suicides; 33 percent were homicides; and the rest were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes. Our ruling The Virginia Center for Public Safety says that since 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire than have been killed in all U.S. wars. Figures going back to 1968 show about 1.5 million firearms deaths have occurred since then. That doesn’t include data from gun deaths from 1963 to 1967, years for which figures aren’t available, so this is a conservative estimate on firearms deaths since Kennedy was assassinated. In contrast, a high-side figure for U.S. war deaths shows that about 1.4 million service members have been killed in conflicts. So we rate the claim True.

pomt-01459	The state-hired company that evaluates state-mandated student exams "goes on Craigslist to get examiners to read our students’ essays."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/oct/02/leticia-van-de-putte/van-de-putte-critical-high-stakes-exam-says-testin/	In a debate at Austin's KLRU-TV, Channel 18, Democrat Leticia Van de Putte, her party’s nominee for lieutenant governor, revisited her declared desire to battle the "high stakes" state-mandated exams imposed by law before students qualify to graduate from high school. But the San Antonio state senator caught our ear in the Sept. 29, 2014, faceoff with Republican nominee Dan Patrick, a Houston state senator, by indicating the company that manages the tests in Texas has some possibly cheapskate habits. After saying students in the top-notch Highland Park school district in Dallas had struggled on the state-imposed English II exam, Van de Putte added: "Probably because our testing company that makes hundreds of millions of dollars goes on Craigslist to get examiners to read our students’ essays." We wondered if the scorer posts get filled starting from free ads placed on Craigslist, the mostly free online classified ad service founded in 1995. In January 2013, a couple of news reports said Pearson, the company hired by the Texas Education Agency to administer the state tests, had been using Craigslist to advertise openings. According to a Jan. 16, 2013, blog post by the Answer Sheet newsletter on The Washington Post’s website, and pointed out to us by Van de Putte spokesman Manny Garcia, Pearson ran an ad on Craigslist Nov. 29, 2012, looking for people to hire and train to score the written portion of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills; that was then the name of the state exams. "According to a press release released by leaders of a coalition of people in Texas seeking to reform standardized testing in the state," Answer Sheet said, "the ad says college graduates would be paid $12 an hour for doing the job. According to the Craigslist ad, ‘Bachelor degree required – any field welcome,’" Answer Sheet said, adding that the coalition was urging legislators and the TEA to find a way to ensure only English teachers graded student essays in the exams. A few days later, KDFW-TV, Channel 4 in Dallas, aired a news report saying Pearson Testing "uses Craigslist to solicit people to grade" the state test, which had been revised and renamed the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness. This story included a statement from the TEA stating the agency was "fully aware that the Pearson Testing company utilizes multiple employment avenues to secure and adequately train qualified candidates. Pearson carefully trains the graders, and experienced supervisors oversee the work to ensure that essays are graded in a fair and consistent manner." On its website, KDFW included information attributed to Pearson stating Pearson exhaustively searches for the best people to score student tests relying on the same employment resources school districts use to promote career opportunities. Pearson said its search for scorers in Texas extended to ads with 21 organizations and publications including the National Council of Teachers of English, the Austin American-Statesman and the Texas Workforce Commission--as well as Craigslist, ClassifiedAds.com and the Austin Chronicle among venues, Pearson said. "All test scorers hired by Pearson must have at least a four-year degree and undergo very rigorous, state-approved training before they are allowed to begin work," Pearson said, according to KDFW. "As part of this rigorous training, applicants must complete and pass practice sets before being eligible to work. The rigorous training program for scorers was developed with the Texas Education Agency, and TEA must approve all final training materials." We double-checked this additional information, confirming from Pearson that the company posts ads on Craigslist and numerous other outlets. By email, Debbie Ratcliffe, a TEA spokeswoman, provided Pearson’s 2013 statement on the Craigslist criticism. She also guided us to Dave Clark, a Texas-based Pearson official, who said by phone Craigslist is among 21 advertising venues used by Pearson when it’s hunting for qualified test scorers. Clark said: "We have to blanket the entire state to find scorers; it’s seasonal work." Asked if using Craigslist leaves the impression that the recruitment of scorers is slapdash, Clark replied that if so, people would have to reach a similar illogical characterization of the other places where Pearson advertises such jobs. To our inquiry, Brandon Pinette, a Washington, D.C.-based Pearson spokesman, emailed a statement similar to the one circulated in 2013. Among recent applicants to grade the Texas exams, Pinette advised, 11 percent fulfilled Pearson’s requirements. Among the successful applicants, he said, 71 percent had at least a year of classroom teaching experience, 83 percent had writing-intensive four-year college degrees and 27 percent had a degree in English. Our ruling Van de Putte, who has said she opposes high-stakes state-imposed student testing, said the company that scores the existing state tests "goes on Craigslist to get examiners to read our students’ essays." There’s a strand of truth here; scorer positions have been advertised on Craigslist. But this statement leaves a loosey-goosey impression by not acknowledging the testing company spreads the word about its scorer jobs in a wide range of venues. Also unnoted, the company further screens applicants to ensure they’re up to the job. Such information was public nearly two years ago. We rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-11698	"The truth is this tax [plan] raises middle-class taxes."	half-true	/new-york/statements/2017/dec/22/kirsten-gillibrand/will-republican-tax-law-raise-middle-class-taxes/	Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand claims the major tax overhaul passed by Congress this week will increase tax bills for middle-class earners in New York state. Gillibrand, in Buffalo on Dec 15, said filers who pay state and local taxes in New York state will be hit particularly hard by the legislation. "I'm concerned, obviously, about this tax bill because it's going to raise taxes on the middle class," Gillibrand said. "The truth is this tax [plan] raises middle-class taxes. For all New Yorkers who pay local and state taxes, it’s going to be very difficult, because they’re going to have to pay a lot more money." Gillibrand made the claim before Republicans released their final tax bill, a compromise between versions passed in the House and Senate. We’re basing our fact check on details that were available at the time. Was she right that middle-class earners will see higher taxes under the Republican plan? Other tax benefits Research groups across the political spectrum agree that the middle class will benefit from provisions in the tax law -- at least at first. The standard deduction will double to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married filers. That change was also in the Senate bill. More filers will come out ahead using the standard deduction instead of itemizing state and local taxes. A majority of middle-income filers already take the standard deduction instead of itemizing. About 44 percent of those making between $50,000 and $75,000 deduct state and local taxes in New York state according to the Tax Policy Center. Even in states like New York, where a third of taxpayers deduct their state and local taxes from their federal tax, the new limits on those deductions are not likely to result in higher overall tax bills. Tax rates for middle-income earners will go down. Those making between about $38,000 and $70,000 will see their federal tax rate decrease from 25 percent to 22 percent, for example. Middle-income filers will also benefit from a provision to double the child tax credit to $2,000. For those who owe little or no taxes, up to $1,400 of that credit is refundable. "The good news for taxpayers is that every income group would pay less in taxes in 2019," according to a PolitiFact analysis. The analysis was based on data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan group that analyzes tax bills for Congress, and the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. Down the road The Joint Committee on Taxation predicted that taxpayers making $40,000 and up would see a tax cut immediately until 2025 under the law. In 2019, filers at every income level will see a tax cut. The average person making $45,000 would see the amount of their income spent on federal taxes decrease from 10.9 percent to 9.9 percent, according to the committee's report. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tax benefit shifts after 2025 when most changes for individual filers expire, including the lower tax brackets and cap on state and local tax deductions. After the individual provisions expire, all filers who make $75,000 or less annually will see a tax increase. "Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027," according to the PolitiFact analysis. "That’s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average." Republicans hope a future Congress will extend the individual provisions. Experts believe that’s likely, though it’s not guaranteed. Our ruling Gillibrand said the Republican "tax [plan] raises middle-class taxes." That's not true during the first years of the new tax provisions. If not for the sunset for the tax changes for individuals, we likely would have rated Gillibrand's statement False or perhaps Mostly False. Middle-income taxpayers will either benefit or see no change in their tax liability through 2025. But her claim could hold up after the bill's individual provisions expire that year. There's no guarantee a future Congress will extend those parts of the bill. So for that reason, her statement is partially true but still ignores important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-10720	"People were hopeless. Sixty percent of the population, 70 percent of the population wanted to live somewhere else. . . . By the time I left, 70 percent wanted to stay."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/21/rudy-giuliani/the-frown-was-already-turning-upside-down/	New Yorkers weren't happy just before Rudy Giuliani took office, but it wasn't as dire as he says. That 60 or 70 percent figure he mentions was two-year-old news by the time he took office. In November 1991, the New York Times / WCBS-TV News conducted a poll among New Yorkers in which 60 percent said things had gotten so bad in the city they would leave tomorrow, if they could. But that startling figure, which Giuliani uses, had changed by the time he prepared to take office. Just before Giuliani defeated incumbent Mayor David Dinkins, the Times and WCBS did the poll again. Between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, 1993, they asked 1,223 adults some questions about New York City. The responses were generally pessimistic; the Times referred to them as "grim." Nearly two-thirds viewed the economy as bad or very bad, almost as many thought crime had gotten worse, and so on. Here was the New York Times description of the "want to leave" issue: "In its most provocative finding, the survey determined that 45 percent of respondents said things had got so bad in New York that they would move out tomorrow if they could. Some pollsters played down the significance of the finding, noting that similar surveys in Chicago and London also showed many residents said they wanted to leave immediately." That 45 percent may be disturbing, but it's not 60 or 70 percent, as Giuliani said. In fact, despite the "grim" findings about New Yorker attitudes, the percentage who wanted to leave had been dropping sharply in the two years before Giuliani took office. From 60 percent in 1991 to 45 percent in 1993. It fell to about 33 percent in eight years under Giuliani. As for 70 percent wanting to stay, the Giuliani campaign cites a New York Times /CBS News poll in August 2001, just before the 9/11 attacks and in the midst of a campaign to elect a successor to Giuliani. The New York Times reported that "barely a third" of the respondents said they would move out of the city if they could and added that "about 60 percent" of New Yorkers wanted to stay in New York. It should be noted that the question had a couple of important predicates, including a longer-term time horizon: "Looking ahead about four years, if it was entirely up to you, would you want to be living where you are now, or would you want to be living somewhere else in New York City, or outside the city." A variation on earlier surveys limited the choice to NYC or "somewhere else," but the negative results varied only a little when both versions of the question were used. So the "city that I was handed" at the end of 1993 did not have 60 or 70 percent who wanted to leave, but only 45 percent, according to the polls, and the city Giuliani managed for nearly eight years had 60 percent who wanted to stay, according to the poll he cites, not 70 percent. There's no disagreement among sources here. Giuliani just misquotes the numbers, and does so in a way that reflects better on him. We find his statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11426	"Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/mar/16/andrew-cuomo/half-female-homicides-us-involve-intimate-partner/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants state lawmakers to pass a bill he believes would prevent more women from being murdered by people close to them. The bill would remove guns from people convicted on misdemeanor domestic violence charges. Guns are currently only taken away if someone has a felony conviction for domestic violence. "Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners," Cuomo said at a March 13 rally. The bill is part of Cuomo’s 2018 Women’s Agenda, a list of more than two dozen proposals concerning healthcare, equal pay and gun violence among other issues. The domestic violence bill doubles as one of the governor’s proposals to add to the state’s gun control laws. New York state already has one of the lowest rates of gun-caused death in the country, but Cuomo believes the proposal could drive that number lower. Is he right that half of women murdered in the U.S. are killed by their intimate partners? The data Cuomo’s claim comes from data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2017. The agency looked at the homicides of 10,018 adult women in 18 states from 2003 to 2014. The circumstances of the homicide were known in 8,028 of the cases. Of those, 4,442 homicides, or 55.3 percent, were related to intimate partner violence. The report defines an intimate partner as a current, former, or unspecified spouse or romantic partner. Women killed while intervening in an incident of intimate partner violence, like a friend or family member, were also counted in this category. Almost 80 percent of intimate partner homicides involved a current intimate partner. About 11 percent of victims had experienced violence in the month preceding their death. An argument preceded the victim’s death in about a third of intimate partner homicides, the report found. Gun-involved homicides The report does not include data on the criminal history of the suspects. It’s not known what share had a history of domestic violence. But the agency did collect information on the type of weapon used in each homicide. A firearm was used in 5,234 of the total homicides, or almost 54 percent. That’s more than double the number of victims killed with a sharp instrument, the next most-documented weapon. The authors of the report suggest legislation like Cuomo’s could help prevent more female homicides in the future. "State statutes limiting access to firearms for persons under a domestic violence restraining order can serve as another preventive measure associated with reduced risk for intimate partner homicide and firearm intimate partner homicide," the report said. A report from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found an estimated 45 percent of female homicide victims were killed by an intimate partner in 2007. New York state data Numbers in New York state mirror national data. About 48 percent of female domestic homicides in New York state involved an intimate partner in 2016, according to a report from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. A firearm was used in about a third of all domestic homicides in New York state. The state data does not include homicides where there was no known relationship between the suspect and victim. Our ruling Cuomo said "Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners." Data collected by the CDC supports Cuomo’s claim. More than half of the female homicides the agency studied involved an intimate partner when the relationship was known. We rate his claim True.

pomt-06073	The EPA was asked about an environmental citation for the city landfill in Nashua, N.H. but "didn’t know" why it was cited.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-epa-didnt-know-why-it-cited-new/	Excessive government regulation commanded a good portion of the NBC News-Facebook GOP debate on Meet the Press on the morning of Jan. 8, 2012. During the debate, former Speaker Newt Gingrich was asked about his idea to replace the Environmental Protection Agency. Gingrich was quick to criticize the government agency designed to "protect human health and the environment." "If you look at the EPA's record, it is increasingly radical," Gingrich said. "It's increasingly imperious. It doesn't cooperate, it doesn't collaborate, and it doesn't take into account economics. The city of Nashua recently had a dump that was cited by EPA. They went down to find out, what was it being cited for? And they told them, frankly, ‘We don't know. We can't find the records that lead to this citation, and we're not exactly sure what it referenced. But it must be bad or we wouldn't have sent it out.’" We wondered whether Gingrich’s vague classification of an EPA citation really went down that way. First we contacted Gingrich’s campaign to find out how the speaker came up with this example, but they never got back to us. We turned to Nashua Telegraph reporter Albert McKeon, who did a story on the city’s EPA problem last month, to see if Gingrich explained the situation accurately. As far as "a citation" goes, McKeon said Gingrich framed that explanation incorrectly. EPA didn't give the dump a citation. Rather it put it on a list, McKeon said. "The description for the list itself is very vague. It says it doesn’t imply any organization has committed any violation, it just triggered them to be on a list of being watched." McKeon reported that Four Hills Landfill in Nashua had appeared on three months’ worth of the EPA’s watch lists for supposed violators of the Clean Air, Clean Water and Resource Conservation and Recovery (for hazardous waste) acts. The purpose of the watch list, however, seemed a little fuzzy. According to the EPA Web site, the watch list exists "to facilitate dialogue between EPA, state and local environmental agencies on enforcement matters relating to facilities with alleged violations identified as either significant or high priority." Being on the watch list does not mean a facility has violated the law, according to the agency, but only that an EPA investigation, or a state or local environmental study, has led an organization to assert an unproven violation has occurred. "Being on the watch list does not represent a higher level of concern regarding the alleged violations that were detected, but instead indicates cases requiring additional dialogue between EPA, state and local agencies -- primarily because of the length of time the alleged violation has gone unaddressed or unresolved," the EPA site says. The reason Nashua’s dump made the list also was vague, McKeon said. EPA spokesman Dave Deegan, working at the agency’s Boston offices, told McKeon a "data lag" on the watch list, which cited a long-ago state Department of Environmental Services action against the Nashua landfill, got Four Hills on the list. But Four Hills had had no violations in recent memory and was in compliance with environmental standards, Deegan said. "Nashua had no idea they were on the list, and the EPA, quite frankly, didn’t either," McKeon said. "(Deegan) said it was a violation in the past. He said they were not really sure what it was, but somehow it got transferred to the EPA's database, and it shouldn’t be on there because there were no problems with Nashua." Nashua being on the list was more a matter of not keeping records up-to-date. Nashua is not currently under any scrutiny for any violations, according to the city and the EPA. Our ruling: Gingrich said the EPA cited a Nashua landfill without knowing its reason for doing so. The landfill made a "watch list" for an outdated action, but it was not cited or fined for any violation by the EPA for being on the list. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-14954	Some 8.1 million of the estimated 11 million to 12 million people "in this country illegally are working."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/23/ron-johnson/two-thirds-people-country-illegally-are-working-go/	Like many conservatives, U.S. Ron Johnson has repeatedly called for the United States to secure its borders. But in making that call again Oct. 7, 2015, the Wisconsin Republican also seemed to defend most of the estimated 11 million residents who are living in the country illegally. Johnson was interviewed on a conservative talk show on KTLK-AM in Minnesota's Twin Cities. The topic was a hearing he would lead the next day as chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Asked by a listener if it's possible to secure the border and "negotiate" undocumented immigrants, Johnson replied: "Of course, that is the first step. We have to secure the border, we have to give the American public confidence that we're going to actually secure the border. "And then, we're a compassionate nation. We're going to deal with that reality of 11 to 12 million people. By the way, in our hearings, (we were told) 8.1 million of those people in this country illegally are working, and most of them are working hard, contributing to their communities. This is an untenable situation, we need to bring those people out of the shadows, but first we need to secure the border." If Johnson’s statistical claim is accurate, two-thirds or more of undocumented immigrants are employed. But his description of the 8 million as workers overstates the situation a bit. The figures The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not attempt to count the number of unauthorized immigrants who are working. But we found estimates, based on census data, that were made by the the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. They are from a July 2015 report and a November 2014 report. As of 2014, there were 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, Pew said, in an estimate roughly the same as one by the Department of Homeland Security. According to Pew: Most of them live in six states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. Half are Mexican. Regarding work, Pew estimated that in 2012 there were 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants who were either working or looking for work -- that is, they were in the labor force -- people ages 16 and older who are employed or looking for work. Pew told us it does not have a breakdown on how many were working and how many were looking for work. When we asked Johnson’s office for information to back his statement, the office cited verbal testimony from Pew senior demographer Jeffrey Passel, the author of the research we've cited. He appeared before Johnson's committee in March 2015. Passel told the committee: "Although unauthorized immigrants represent about three and a half percent of the nation’s population, the 8.1 million unauthorized immigrant workers account for about 5 percent of the labor force." So, Passel referred to the 8.1 million as workers, but also to the labor force, which counts workers and people looking for work. Our rating Johnson said 8.1 million of the estimated 11 million to 12 million people "in this country illegally are working." His statement goes a bit too far. The latest estimates from a nonpartisan research group show that as of 2012, there were 8.1 million undocumented immigrants in the labor force -- some working, others looking for work. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-06344	"A couple retiring today will pay about $119,000 in lifetime Medicare taxes and receive about $357,000 in lifetime Medicare benefits. ... about 3 bucks in benefits for every dollar in taxes."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/08/rob-portman/retiring-couples-get-3-medicare-benefits-each-1-pa/	The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, better known as the congressional "super committee," has a deadline of Nov. 23 to come up with a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Democrats on the bipartisan, 12-member panel offered a proposal in late October that included about $400 billion in cuts to Medicare. While the plan had no chance of winning approval from the committee's Republicans, who have said they will not accept a package with tax increases, it underlined the point that any plan is certain to make cuts to federal entitlement programs, especially Medicare. The super committee's co-chair, Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, noted in a hearing on Nov. 1 that President Obama had called Medicare and Medicaid "the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin." More attention focused on health care in the hearing, which featured testimony by the co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles. Sen. Rob Portman at one point described Medicare now as an unsustainable program. "A couple retiring today will pay about $119,000 in lifetime Medicare taxes and receive about $357,000 in lifetime Medicare benefits," the Ohio Republican said. "So that's about 3 bucks in benefits for every dollar in taxes. If you multiply this by the 77 million retiring baby boomers, it's not hard to see why we have an unsustainable program." PolitiFact Ohio knew the prospects for Medicare sustaining itself weren’t good, but we were surprised at the 3-to-1 ratio of benefits to taxes, particularly because of the popular belief among recipients that "you earned it, you paid for it." We asked Portman's office for background. They referred us to a study from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan public policy organization. Authored by fellow Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury Department official, the widely cited study was published early this year and subsequently updated. It says a two-income couple in which both partners earned an average wage ($43,500 each in 2011) and retired in 2011 would pay $119,000 in Medicare taxes and receive $357,000 in benefits. We looked more closely at the study and found that the ratio was even more skewed for a single-income couple. "Over a wide range of scenarios, beneficiaries retiring at age 65 in 2011 can expect to receive dramatically more in total benefits than they have paid in dedicated taxes," it concluded. "If only one member of the couple had worked, we calculate a six-fold difference between contributions and benefits since both spouses are eligible for Medicare yet only one has paid taxes." Looking at the bigger picture, the report said, "It is no wonder these programs now account for one-third of all federal spending each year." The study, which was updated specifically to inform super committee discussions, concluded that "changes to entitlement programs are inevitable as part of a sound fiscal policy." It asserted that anything short of a comprehensive, overall view would merely be tinkering. Its bottom line: "Tax rates that have not kept pace with ever-rising benefit levels, increasing years of support, spiraling health costs, and fewer workers per retiree all imply that current and future generations of workers are going to have to do something to get these elderly benefit programs into order, either by paying higher taxes or receiving fewer benefits for themselves." We make no ruling on those difficult choices. The difficult situation described by Portman is another matter. On the Truth-O-Meter his claim rates True.

pomt-11444	"The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas. They don’t tell you that."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2018/mar/13/donald-trump/no-mr-president-california-not-begging-wall/	During his visit to the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego, President Donald Trump made this confounding claim: "The state of California is begging us to build walls" along the border. Deep blue California is "begging" the federal government to build a wall? Really? The president’s statement seemed false on its face, but we dug in for a fact-check just to make sure. Our research Here’s Trump’s full statement made March 13, 2018: "For the people that say 'no wall,' if you had no walls over here, you wouldn’t have a country. The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas. They don’t tell you that. And we said no, we won’t do it until we build the whole wall." We asked Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s office about Trump’s statement. A spokesman for the governor indicated he had no idea what Trump was talking about. "We gave up trying to translate – and fully understand – the tweets and extemporaneous thoughts of the president long ago," Evan Westrup said in an email. Others rejected Trump’s claim outright: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democratic candidate for governor and top Trump critic, tweeted: "California is not "begging" you for this wall. Your wall is a waste of money and is literally impossible to complete. It will look more like a piece of swiss cheese than an insurmountable barrier. It's nothing more than a 6th century solution to a 21st century problem." "Not exactly sure where he got that from" Immigration and environmental experts said the state of California, at least in recent years, hasn’t expressed any desire to build a border wall. "Not at all," said Louis DeSipio, a UC Irvine political science professor who studies immigration. "I’m not exactly sure where (Trump) got that from. Perhaps he heard it from some local sheriff who wants a wall." "It’s been increasingly difficult to make sense of the things this administration says, and President Trump in particular," added Randy Serraglio, a spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity. The environmental group and state government were part of a recent lawsuit against the federal government’s plans to build the wall in California. Federal judge Gonzalo Curiel rejected their argument about environmental concerns and ruled the Trump administration could move forward on the project. Not the first confusing claim This is not the first time Trump has made a strange claim about California’s desire to build sections of a border wall. On Feb. 28, 2018, following the judge’s ruling, Trump tweeted: "I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!" National news outlets attempted to make sense of that tweet, without success. A Politico article assessed the tweet this way: "It was not clear what Trump meant in suggesting that 'California wants' a border wall 'now,' since the state opposed his administration’s efforts. White House spokespeople did not immediately return emails seeking further clarity regarding the president’s post and whether the administration intends to delay work in California even after securing a judicial victory." We found an interview with one top California Democrat, Attorney General Xavier Beccera, indicating he could support a barrier at the border, but no statements where top leaders are "begging" for a wall. Becerra told the Los Angeles Times in September 2017 that he supports "doing what our experts tell us we should do" on border security, whether that includes a physical barrier, more troops on the ground or virtual enforcement through aerial detection or surveillance. On the day of Trump’s California visit, Becerra was stronger in his response to Trump. He told Fox News, "We’ve always called for border security on a bipartisan basis, but building walls, that’s a medieval technology that really doesn’t have a place in the 21st century" Perhaps Trump meant Californians, and not their state government, want the wall? But even in that case, the president is wrong. A September 2017 survey showed 68 percent of likely voters in the state oppose building a wall along the entire southern border. The White House responded to a request for evidence after publication. We have included its response at the end of this fact check. Our ruling President Trump claimed "the state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas," along the border. "They don’t tell you that." There’s no evidence backing up the president’s mystifying statement. If anything, California and its Democratic leaders are some of the strongest opponents of Trump’s border wall, at least as he’s promoted it. Some state leaders rejected Trump’s claim outright while others said they had no idea what he was talking about. We rated Trump’s claim Pants On Fire. UPDATE: A White House spokesman responded to our request for evidence after publication. He cited "great efforts" by the federal government "to collaborate with local and state authorities" on a two-mile border wall replacement project in Imperial County east of San Diego. The federal government plans to replace an existing barrier in that county with a 30-foot high bollard-style wall. The spokesman also cited a budget plan to create "14 miles of new border wall system that will replace existing secondary fence in the San Diego Sector." While this show the federal government’s interest in replacing sections of border barriers, they do not support or even speak to Trump’s claim "the state of California is begging to build walls" along the border. Our rating remains Pants On Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-09810	Preventive care "saves money."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money-it-doesnt/	President Barack Obama defended his health care plan in a speech to a joint session of Congress, promoting the benefits of reform for those who already have coverage. One of those benefits, he said, is that insurers will be required to cover checkups and other preventive care. "Insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies — because there’s no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse," Obama said. "That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives." It may make sense and save lives, but does it save money? Experts say no. The head of the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that does all the number-crunching for Congress, has said this isn't the case, despite claims from many Democrats to the contrary. "The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall," CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive: "But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. . . Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it." In fact, a new government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf went on. The CBO did not put a price tag on the costs or savings associated with preventive care measures in bills being considered in the House of Representatives because budgeting rules prevent them from doing so. But a few other studies back up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the New England Journal of Medicine that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care. "Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching," according to the paper. "Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs." And a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, "as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs." So, the consensus is that, while preventive care will almost certainly save lives, it won't reduce government spending on health care. As a result, we rate Obama's statement False.

pomt-00935	"Students In Fla. High School Forced To Recite Islamic Prayer, Make Prayer Rugs."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/feb/24/blog-posting/high-schoolers-had-recite-islamic-prayer-class-mak/	A spat between parents and administrators over a Seminole County high school history lesson in Islam has simmered into a minor cause célèbre for online critics. Ron Wagner of Longwood complained to a local TV station that his 15-year-old son was required to recite an Islamic prayer as part of a world history class at Lyman High School. The students also had to make an Islamic prayer rug as a homework assignment, according to Wagner, who said lessons like that don’t belong in public schools. "There’s a difference between teaching of the significance or the impact of a religion and teaching the specific tenets of the religion," Wagner told WFTV on Feb 9, 2015. Blogs and right-leaning media seized on the report, decrying the lessons as attempts to indoctrinate students. One blog, DownTrend.com, featured a post on Feb. 12 with the headline, "Students In Fla. High School Forced To Recite Islamic Prayer, Make Prayer Rugs." We don’t mean to pick on this one site -- because there are many, many other places that have reblogged the report -- and the writer did update the story after we asked him some questions. But the headline encapsulated the alleged events that have outraged so many people. Were students forced to recite an Islamic prayer and make prayer rugs at Lyman High School? PolitiFact Florida did our own homework. Taking notes Wagner met with Seminole County Public Schools administrators on Oct. 17, 2014, to discuss concerns about his son’s 10th grade world history class. Wagner alleged the class had been told to recite the first of the five pillars of Islam as printed in their textbook -- "There is no god, but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God." The prayer, known as the shahada, is an affirmation of faith among Muslims. Wagner also complained about 100 pages missing from his son’s history book and assignments to make Islamic prayer rugs and watch videos about Muslims. He said the teacher had contacted his son directly about the assignments via text messages, without his parents’ knowledge. Wagner’s wife, Lisa Huston, told PolitiFact Florida she and her husband believed the school district was favoring Islam, and that the missing pages were possibly removed deliberately. The textbook, published by Prentice Hall, has been singled out by some Florida and national groups for allegedly being pro-Islam, although it is approved by districts nationwide. District executive director of secondary education Michael Blasewitz conducted an investigation in October to determine if Wagner’s allegations were legitimate. Blasewitz concluded the teacher hadn’t violated any rules. Blasewitz repeated to PolitiFact Florida that the state has included Islam in its world history guidelines, and that Judaism and Christianity both are taught during the sixth grade, which the Florida Department of Education confirmed. You can read the entire district investigation report, but here are the highlights. Text messages: Wagner’s son had enrolled in Remind 101, in which students sign up for a third-party text messaging service for teachers to contact pupils about homework or class events. Blasewitz said parents were allowed to opt in. Missing textbook pages: The district found that 68 of the year-old textbooks lost pages from a binding error. Teachers had reported the problem, but Blasewitz said the school didn’t tell the district. Pearson, the publisher, replaced all the faulty copies, he said. (The missing chapters do include more information on Judaism and Christianity in the context of earlier civilizations.) Videos: The students watched short videos, including a TED Talk about stereotypes featuring an unidentified Iranian-American comedian. While the video did not violate guidelines, the district said a more straightforward selection should be made in future classes. Prayer rugs: Students were told to create prayer rugs, but the lesson was an assignment about Islamic art and not worship. The students were told they could incorporate any religious icons they wanted, as long as they observed Islamic artistic values, including no depictions of people or animals. The district said the assignment could be seen as controversial and recommended that a different art assignment "would be more appropriate." Prayer recitation: Blasewitz interviewed 10 students in the teacher’s two world history classes, and only one remembered the whole class being made to recite the prayer. Other students recalled following the book together in class, and the teacher gave extra credit to students who volunteered to read aloud. The teacher may have written the pillars of Islam on the board, they said, but did not make the students say any of them. Huston insisted to us that at least one other student in a different class period remembered an event similar to her son’s version of events, but Blasewitz said no other complaints had been filed. Our ruling DownTrend.com’s headline read, "Students In Fla. High School Forced To Recite Islamic Prayer, Make Prayer Rugs." This makes it sound as if students were being indoctrinated into a religion, and that's not the case. Instead, students were studying the religion of Islam as part of a world history class. According to a district investigation, pupils were assigned to make prayer rugs as an art assignment. The district recommended a different art assignment be made from now on. As for reciting the pillars of Islam in class, only one student complained his class was made to read the shahada. The investigation cited a notable lack of evidence that anyone was forced to recite a prayer. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14378	The Mitchell Park Domes "lose about $1 million-plus every year" and "the number of people going to the Domes has been going down."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/18/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-mitchell-park-domes-cost-taxpayer/	In February, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele declared the Mitchell Park Domes must be closed, at least temporarily, after chunks of concrete fell from high above. Meanwhile, a consultant told the county it could cost $65 million to $75 million to repair the deteriorating Domes, which house plants from around the world. Almost overnight, the future of the popular attraction became a key issue in the April 5, 2016 election between Abele and challenger Chris Larson, a Democratic state senator. Larson calls the three-dome complex a county treasure and vows to keep the facility running. Abele has been more open to a change, even suggesting residents may prefer something else, such as an amphitheater, to replace them. In a March 3, 2016 interview on WISN-TV, Abele argued it is important to keep options open because the Domes are expensive to operate and not as popular as in past years. "What most people don't know is that the Domes lose $1 million-plus each year," he said in the interview. "The number of people going to the Domes has been going down." That doesn’t sound good. But the county’s own web site offers a different take. "The Domes run an annual operating deficit averaging $630,000 per year, even as attendance has increased," it says, crediting creative programming. Indeed, that programming has taken place under Abele’s watch. So, which is right? Losing money Unlike a freestanding business, the Domes don’t report a "loss" when expenses exceed revenue. Rather, the difference falls to county taxpayers. The loss refers to how much in general property tax money it costs to keep the attraction open, above and beyond admissions and space rental fees (and after expenses). County figures show that going back five years, taxpayer support has ranged from a low of $386,803 in 2015 to a high of $1.11 million in 2014. That was the only year the loss topped $1 million, undermining the "each year" part of Abele’s claim. The average amount spent by taxpayers in that five-year period was $628,000 – just about what the county’s web site said. A memo provided by Abele spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said that "spikes in expenses in recent years are due to engineering studies and significant remedial work completed on the structure." The costs for 2016, of course, are likely to be higher. For instance, the county plans to spend $500,000 on netting and other measures so the facility can reopen while officials sort out its long-term future. Attendance Likewise, the numbers show the opposite of what Abele claimed when it comes to attendance. There has been a steady increase in the past five years, from 187,658 in 2011 – the first year that Abele was in office – to 240,179 in 2015. Baldauff acknowledged the recent growth in attendance, but noted: "In the past the Domes saw annual attendance of more than 374,000 people." She added: "We are far away from the attendance the Domes used to see." We asked: When did the Domes last have 374,000 visitors? The answer: 1988. But that was a generation ago. There have undoubtedly been ups and downs over the years since, but there’s no question attendance has been on the rise. Our rating Abele says the Domes lose more than $1 million every year and that the number of people visiting the attraction has been declining. He’s wrong on both counts. In the past five years, the tab for county taxpayers exceeded $1 million once. On average it was $630,000. Meanwhile, attendance has actually increased 28 percent under his watch.

pomt-07168	Because Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a 30-bill job creation package, "New Jersey ranks 50th in the nation in job creation."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/12/lou-greenwald/assemblyman-lou-greenwald-says-gov-chris-christies/	Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) wants to blame Gov. Chris Christie’s veto pen for New Jersey’s last-place finish in the nation for job growth. But with his own timing, the legislator is guilty of a false start. As the state’s budget battle raged in Trenton, the Assembly Democrats on May 12 posted a video on their website -- www.assemblydems.com -- where Greenwald launched yet another attack on Christie. In an accompanying message that day on Greenwald’s Facebook page, the assemblyman said: "The Governor vetoed our 30 bill job creation package to put New Jerseyans back to work. Unfortunately, now New Jersey ranks 50th in the nation in job creation as a result." PolitiFact New Jersey decided to explore Greenwald’s argument, and found an inherent timing conflict between when the governor’s vetoes occurred and Greenwald’s job growth statistics. First, let’s talk about that veto pen. The Assembly Democrats on May 18 provided a list of 33 bills comprising the "Back to Work NJ Economic Development Package." Of those bills, 30 were passed by the Assembly and the Senate by early January, and another was passed by both houses by mid-February, according to the Legislature’s website. Two bills were passed only in the Assembly, never making it to the governor’s desk. Of the 31 bills submitted to Christie by the time of Greenwald’s statement, the governor signed 13 and vetoed 18. After Greenwald’s statement, Christie signed one of the bills that he had conditionally vetoed. The Legislature had incorporated his recommendations. Greenwald, who is chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee, is clearly wrong when he says the governor vetoed a "30 bill job creation package." As far as whether those vetoes are to blame for New Jersey’s job growth ranking, here’s the problem: Christie vetoed those bills in February and March. But when we checked with Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, about where Greenwald got his job growth rankings, Hester pointed us to federal data on job growth from December 2009 to December 2010. That means, according to Greenwald’s logic, Christie’s vetoes in February and March were to blame for a lack of job growth through the previous December. Asked about this timing conflict, Brian McGinnis, Greenwald’s communications director, emailed us a "clarification," which read as follows: "The reason why the Legislature passed a job creation package was to stimulate an economy struggling to create jobs that was on a worrisome trend. With the Governor’s failure to sign those bills, it destines New Jersey to continue falling further behind and stay dead last in the nation in job creation." But did Greenwald admit his original statement was wrong? McGinnis told us: "The clarification speaks for itself." Now, let’s take a closer look at those job growth rankings. Hester directed us to a chart on page 2 of a Feb. 4 report from the Pennsylvania-based, liberal-leaning Keystone Research Center. According to that chart -- based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics -- New Jersey ranked 50th for the number of seasonally adjusted jobs created from December 2009 to December 2010. But since Greenwald made his comments in May, PolitiFact New Jersey was looking for more recent figures. Keystone Research Center told us that for the period from March 2010 to March 2011 -- the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics available at the time of Greenwald’s statement -- New Jersey ranked 49th in both the number of jobs created and the percent change in jobs. To be more specific, New Jersey lost 1,700 jobs from March 2010 to March 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data at the time of Greenwald's statement. Kansas and New Mexico were the only other states to have job losses during that same time period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To explain New Jersey’s economic plight, experts from Rutgers University pointed to the loss of government jobs in 2010 and climbing tax rates during the last decade. Those increases helped erase the state’s previous reputation as a low-cost place to do business. It’s worth noting that a less awful picture emerges when the study period is narrowed. Doug Hall of the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, ran the numbers for us and determined that from September 2010 to March 2011, New Jersey ranked 37th in the number of jobs created and 43rd in percent change. From December 2010 to March 2011, New Jersey ranked 36th in the number of jobs created and 43rd in percent change. "There are signs of hope, I suppose," said Hall, director of EPI’s Economic Analysis and Research Network. In regard to New Jersey's job figures between March 2010 and March 2011, the analyses performed by the Keystone Research Center and Hall were based on federal data for seasonally adjusted jobs available at the time of Greenwald's statement. After a decade where private sector jobs sunk by 153,700 and government jobs rose by 68,800, New Jersey is starting to head in the other direction, according to James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. In the first quarter of 2011, New Jersey added 6,100 private jobs -- more than the number added in all of 2010, Hughes said. The government sector may stabilize during 2012 and the "private-sector growth is already back," he said in an email. "The only caution is a national economy which shows signs of weakening, which will feed back to NJ," Hughes wrote in the email. Returning to Greenwald’s statement, let’s review: Greenwald overstated the number of Christie’s vetoes from February and March, and claimed they are why New Jersey ranks 50th in job growth. But a spokesman said Greenwald’s rankings were based on data from between December 2009 and December 2010. Greenwald’s rankings aren’t far off from more recent calculations that show New Jersey ranks 49th in a year-over-year comparison. Yet when we look at three- and six-month periods, the Garden State is faring a little bit better. But Greenwald’s biggest mistake here is to blame Christie’s vetoes from February and March for employment changes that occurred several months earlier. That makes the claim not just wrong, but ridiculously wrong. Pants on Fire! To comment on this ruling, join the conversation at NJ.com.

pomt-03210	Says Terry McAuliffe is "the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/aug/26/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinell-overstates-mcauliffes-role-lincoln-bedro/	The Lincoln Bedroom in the White House looms in this year’s gubernatorial race. Within the history of the ornate chamber, Republican Ken Cuccinelli says, lies proof of Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s questionable ethics. "He’s the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom," Cuccinelli said of his opponent during an Aug. 10 appearance before Northern Virginia business leaders. Cuccinelli is referring to details of a scandal that erupted in 1997 as Congress investigated charges that President Bill Clinton and McAuliffe masterminded a program that allowed top patrons of the Democratic Party to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom. McAuliffe, at the time, was finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee. We looked into the claim that the White House sleepovers were McAuliffe’s idea. Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli, sent an email citing a variety of old news reports and copies of documents that she said prove "the Lincoln Bedroom scandal originated from a McAuliffe memo." So let’s travel back in time. On Dec. 27, 1994, McAuliffe had breakfast with Clinton in the White House. A month earlier, mid-term elections established Republican majorities in the House for the first time in 40 years and in the Senate for the first time in eight years. McAuliffe wanted to come up with a plan to reconnect demoralized Democratic supporters with Clinton in preparation for the president’s reelection two years later. About a week after the meeting, McAuliffe sent a memo to Nancy Hernreich, Clinton’s director of Oval Office operations, suggesting the president meet party supporters at meals, coffees, golf games and morning jogs. McAuliffe also listed ten of the party’s "top supporters." In his 2009 book, "What a Party," McAuliffe wrote that he thought there was "nothing controversial" about the memo. "A candidate was going to spend time with his supporters. What a shocker that was," he wrote. "I was careful how I worded the memo because the Clinton White House leaked like a sieve, and the only question in my mind was how many minutes it would take before a copy of this memo would be hand-delivered to The Washington Post. Little did I know that this would become the infamous Lincoln Bedroom Memo." The one-page note became the focus a probe by congressional Republicans into fundraising at the Clinton White House. The memo did not propose that donors should stay overnight at the White House, but the prospect of sleepovers was mentioned in notes that were later scrawled on the front and back of the document. Hernreich said in a June 20, 1997, deposition to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that she wrote the word "overnights" on the front of the memo, next to the list of ten top supporters. "I don’t honestly know if that was my idea or if it was the president’s idea and under what circumstances I wrote that," Hernreich said. Donald Bucklin, an attorney for the committee, asked Hernreich if the sleepovers idea could have come from any conversation she might have had with McAuliffe. "If I indeed had that conversation with Terry -- I’m not certain I did -- but if I indeed had it, then it could have, although it just as well could not have come from him," Hernreich said. "Honestly, I just don’t know, really." On the back of the memo, Clinton wrote a note to Hernreich saying "ready to start overnights right away." McAuliffe told the committee in a June 6, 1997 deposition that he never got his memo back with the notes written on it. McAuliffe denied coming up with the idea for the overnights. But he acknowledged to Gus Puryear, an attorney for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, that the DNC recommended donors who should be invited to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom. Puryear: Did you ever personally propose that someone be included in an overnight stay at the White House? McAuliffe: "Generally Gus, how this would happen is someone may call and say they’d like to do it. I would have turned it over to (DNC staffers), and they probably would have sent it to the political office. There were many recommendations, I believe, from many people." Puryear: "Do you remember any person that you recommended?" McAuliffe: "I cannot, no, but I’m not saying they didn’t call my office. I take a lot of pride in what I did and how I did it. I was not a concierge service." So who came up with idea for the sleepovers? Clinton, in a February 1997 deposition, said it was his brainchild. "Terry McAuliffe sent a memo suggesting things we ought to do to re-establish contact, which I thought was a good memo. And I told him to proceed," Clinton said, according to a Feb. 27, 1997, New York Times reprint of his remarks. "And I told Nancy Hernreich in addition to that that I wanted to ask some of my friends who had helped me when I got elected President, that I hadn’t been in touch with, to come to the White House and spend the night with me." Clinton maintained the White House overnights were not intended to rev up donations, saying "the Lincoln Bedroom was never sold." But the GOP investigation concluded the stays were "an important means by which the DNC raised funds from contributors." It pointed to a White House document that listed 51 "long-time friends" who stayed overnight. Forty-nine of those people, the GOP said, contributed a total of $4.1 million to the DNC for the 1996 elections. Democratic members, in their own findings said that "the committee found no evidence of a systematic scheme to trade overnight visits at the White House for campaign contributions." Cuccinelli’s campaign, in backing its claim that McAuliffe came up with the sleepover plan, also directed us to an editorial in the Chicago Sun-Times on Sept. 7, 1999, that said McAuliffe is known in Washington as "the guy who invented the idea of having President Clinton invite major campaign contributors to be lured and rewarded with sleepover nights in the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House." The campaign also cited a Feb. 2, 2001, editorial in The New York Times that criticized McAuliffe for supporting Clinton’s fundraising schemes, calling him "a walking symbol of the wretched excess of the Clinton years." Our ruling Cuccinelli, in attacking McAuliffe’s ethics, says the Democrat is "the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom." McAuliffe authored a memo in early 1995 listing ways Clinton could connect with top Democratic patrons. But the original note did not mention White House sleepovers; that idea was later added in the handwriting of others. McAuliffe has always denied he came up with the scheme; Clinton in 1997 took full responsibility for the idea. No doubt, McAuliffe strongly backed the sleepovers and recommended heavy hitters that should be offered a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. But we see no evidence that McAuliffe "invented the scheme." We rate Cuccinelli’s statement False.	None	Ken Cuccinelli	None	None	None	2013-08-26T05:00:00	2013-08-10	['None']
pomt-09915	During a town hall meeting on health care, "ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/30/lamar-smith/abc-broadcast-networks-controversial-issue-ads/	Rep. Lamar Smith was outraged that ABC News was dedicating a day of coverage to health care reform, capping it off with an exclusive town hall with President Barack Obama. "It was like a rigged football game," Smith told Greta Van Susteren during an interview on Fox News. "The president had home field advantage. ABC was the only referee. The opposing team wasn't allowed on the field. But ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired." Smith, a Republican from Texas, made his comments even before the special aired on June 24, 2009. We wanted to know if it was true that ABC "didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired." A call to ABC confirmed that this was true. Though ABC accepts advertising for political candidates, it has a policy of rejecting ads that advocate for general political issues, a spokeswoman told us. We tried to ask more detailed questions about the policy, but she wouldn't talk about specifics. We were able to find several news reports about ABC rejecting other ads over the years, including ads that opposed the oil industry and the Iraq war. Adding another wrinkle, local ABC affiliates set their own standards to sell ads. Naturally, viewers at home have no way of knowing if the ad was sold by the local affiliate or the parent network. Smith complained after the advocacy group Conservatives for Patients' Rights tried and failed to buy ads during the president's town hall. The group is opposed to Democratic plans for the health care system because they say it would create a socialized medical system similar to Canada's or Britain's. (We examined one of their ads back in April and rated a claim about health effectiveness research as Barely True .) Conservatives for Patients' Rights disputed ABC's claim that it did not accept advocacy ads. In a letter to ABC, the group cited a report from TNS Media Intelligence, a respected independent media firm, that showed ad buys by T. Boone Pickens, who argues for energy independence, and the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which promotes fiscal responsibility. We asked Andrew Tyndall, who monitors the major network news programs at his Web site the Tyndall Report, about advocacy ads appearing on the networks. He said it's true that ABC and the other major networks forbid issue advocacy ads, but there is a gray area: The networks will accept public-interest ads from lobbying groups that are generally positive in tone and message. These types of ads usually air during the Sunday morning shows, he said. "You can't address matters of public controversy in those. You can only burnish your image," Tyndall said. In theory, if Conservatives for Patients' Rights had designed an ad that talked about how wonderful the private insurance system is, that might have passed muster with ABC. "You can say the good part, but not the bad part," Tyndall concluded. The network's rules are internal standards that are holdovers from the days when broadcast networks were more closely regulated, Tyndall said. In fact, advocacy ads usually air on local affiliates and cable channels, and there are several reasons for this, said Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group that is part of TNS Media Intelligence. On cable news channels, advertisers feel like they're reaching a demographic that includes news junkies and policymakers. When Congress is in session, advocacy groups will buy time with affiliates in Washington, D.C. That advertising follows members of Congress home to local affiliates during the breaks, especially if the member is a swing vote or chairs a committee with jurisdiction over a particular issue. The handful of national networks, though, just want to avoid controversy. "By and large, historically, they've stayed away from this stuff as much as possible, though no one is 100 percent pure," Tracey said. "There's probably stuff they've taken in the past where the salespeople said, 'This isn't very controversial,' and so they took it." In this case, things may have worked out well for both sides, Tracey said. "ABC is probably happy they didn't take the spot, and Conservatives for Patients' Rights is just as happy because they didn't have to pay for it, and they still get their publicity." The congressman is right, though. He said, "ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired." Groups who opposed Obama's plan tried to buy advertising during his town hall meeting and were turned down. Even ABC said that was the case. We rate Smith's statement True.

pomt-03151	"Before President Obama acted in Libya in 2011, the American people were opposed to military action by 35 to 60. After he took action, they were in support of it 54 to 43."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/10/karl-rove/rove-says-public-tends-rally-behind-military-actio/	With attacks on Syria being debated in Washington, public opinion stands clearly opposed to a military strike. A new CNN/ORC poll shows about 60 percent of Americans think Congress should refuse to authorize the use of force. Even as an offer of Syrian chemical weapons destruction takes shape, the White House is lobbying hard to sway undecided lawmakers, hoping that classified briefings will nudge them into going against the views of their constituents. Political strategist Karl Rove gave the administration a bit of ammunition as it tries to win support for a resolution. The public’s views are flexible, he said. "Before President Obama acted in Libya in 2011, the American people were opposed to military action by 35 to 60," Rove said on Fox News Sunday. "After he took action, they were in support of it 54 to 43." Rove’s point? "The American people do have an animus against any kind of action, but if you take action, and you’re successful, they applaud it," he said. We went back to the record to check whether at the end of the day, public opinion can change direction so completely and so quickly. Rove’s office told us that if anything, Rove’s claim understated the swing in public opinion back in 2011. Three days before Tomahawk missiles struck Libyan air defenses, a Fox News poll showed just 25 percent of the people in favor when asked "Do you favor or oppose the U.S. military getting involved with the situation in Libya?" Those against stood at 65 percent. That was in mid-March 2011. By the end of August, a CNN/ORC poll showed 54 percent said they favored the U.S. military action in Libya, while 43 percent were against it. The timeline It helps to get a sense of what was going on in Libya when these polls were taken. As this timeline shows, the international community quickly rallied to the cause of the protesters who sought to overthrow Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, but the conflict lasted through most of the year. February 2011 -- Popular protests begin, prompting a violent government crackdown. By the end of the month, the UN Security Council had issued a statement condemning the Libyan regime, imposed sanctions and referred Gadhafi to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. March 17, 2011 -- The UN Security Council approves a no-fly zone and the use of all necessary measures to protect civilians. March 19, 2011 -- British, French and American forces move to enforce the no-fly zone, starting with missile attacks to destroy Libyan air defenses. March 24, 2011 -- NATO takes command of the mission to enforce the no-fly zone. April - August 2011 -- Air strikes continue. Special forces from Britain, France, Jordan and Qatar aid the rebels on the ground. August 20, 2011 -- Rebel and Gadhafi loyalists battle in Tripoli. October 20, 2011 -- Rebels capture and kill Gadhafi. Opinions shift, questions matter The earliest poll we found came from the Pew Research Center. Taken around March 13, it showed a clear distaste for the military options. A slight majority favored economic and diplomatic sanctions, but nearly 70 percent opposed arming the rebels, 77 percent opposed bombing Libyan air defenses, and 82 percent opposed sending ground troops. This was very much in line with the Fox News poll. As soon as the missiles were launched, public opinion changed. On March 20, pollsters from CBS News posed this question: "As you may know, the U.S. military and other countries have begun cruise missile and air strikes in Libya in order to protect civilians from attacks by Gadhafi's forces. Do you approve or disapprove of the U.S. and other countries taking this military action in Libya?" Nearly 70 percent of respondents said they approved. But slightly different questions revealed a more closely divided public. Polls at the end of March from Pew Research Center and NBC News/Wall Street Journal asked simply if people thought military engagement was the right or wrong decision. The question did not mention protecting civilians, and support dropped. Both polls found that half the people thought it was the right choice. About 40 percent thought it was the wrong decision and about 10 percent didn’t know. At the very end, in early November 2011, after Gadhafi was dead and a transitional government took over, CBS News asked if the United States had done the right thing by getting involved militarily. Only 37 percent thought the country had done the right thing. Nearly half said America never should have gotten involved. This was well before the attacks on the American diplomatic post in Benghazi, which happened nearly a year later, in 2012. Our ruling Rove said there was a major swing in public opinion from before military action in Libya began to after. In varying degrees, we found polling results that support that conclusion. In general, once the missiles fly, the public tends to take a more favorable view of military engagement. However, some polls found only a modest shift, and much depended on how the question was asked. Overall, the public remained closely divided on the American role in Libya. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2013-09-10T14:38:11	2013-09-08	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama', 'Libya']

pomt-12149	Last year, Democrats won nearly 50% of the vote, yet they hold only 38% of the seats in the state House and 30% of the seats in the state Senate.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/aug/09/roy-cooper/cooper-says-dems-won-nearly-half-2016-vote-hold-on/	The concept of gerrymandering is easy to understand – someone re-draws election districts to favor one political party over another. But it can be difficult to prove or demonstrate. Some point to the party affiliation of voters in a district. (Does a district have more registered Democrats than Republicans?) Some simply point to jagged lines and odd district shapes on an election map. Gov. Roy Cooper, to illustrate gerrymandering in North Carolina, recently compared the number of votes cast in the 2016 general election to the number of seats Democrats hold in the legislature. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling that N.C. General Assembly election maps drawn by state lawmakers were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. Judges recently told state legislators to redraw district maps by Sept. 1. In a July 28 email newsletter, Cooper’s campaign "Cooper for North Carolina" asked supporters for donations to help the governor’s push for fair maps. "Last year, Democrats won nearly 50% of the vote, yet they hold only 38% of the seats in the State House and 30% of the seats in the State Senate," the newsletter claims. The claim implies that some voters’ ballots count far more than others. But is it true? The second part of the claim is accurate.. In the state House, 46 of 120 members are Democrats. In the state Senate, 15 of the 50 members are Democrats. Those percentages check out. The first part of the quote doesn’t specify which Democrats Cooper is talking about, and the full newsletter doesn’t elaborate. A reader might assume it’s referring to the votes cast for the state House and Senate. But campaign spokesman Morgan Jackson says the Democrats who received nearly 50 percent of the vote were those in "all major 2016 races" – not just General Assembly elections. The campaign pointed out the low number of Democrats in the state House and state Senate "to illustrate that North Carolina is a true swing state and Republicans in the General Assembly have unconstitutionally gerrymandered the legislature," Jackson said. Jackson said the campaign looked at the races for president, U.S. Senate, U.S. Congress, state House, state Senate, governor and other Council of State races. Council of State races include the lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, state treasurer, state auditor, superintendent of public instruction, labor commissioner, insurance commissioner and agriculture commissioner. In the races identified by Cooper’s campaign, Democrats won 47.4 percent of the vote, according to the elections board. They garnered about 32.1 million out of 67.8 million total votes, while Republicans got about 35 million votes. Libertarians and unaffiliated candidates got the remaining 671,000 votes. Defining 'nearly' How close were Democrats to drawing 50 percent of the vote, or 33.9 million votes? About 1.7 million votes. Does that constitute "nearly" 50 percent? In the world of statistics, the word "nearly" isn’t well-defined, said Len Stefanski, head of the N.C. State University Department of Statistics. "What a statistician can do is say, when voters are behaving more or less like coin tosses, is 47 percent different from 50 percent when you have 60 million coins tossed? The answer would be yes," Stefanski said. In other words, 1.7 million votes is too many to gloss over. The margin of error for stats that large is 0.012 percent, Stefanski said. On the other hand, people aren’t coins. They can be influenced by current events or even the media, he said. A sign of gerrymandering? Then there’s the issue of whether Democrats’ performance in statewide races, compared with the number of seats they hold in the legislature, is evidence of gerrymandering. Opinions vary. Michael Li, senior redistricting counsel for the NYU School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, thinks the comparison is fair. "It’s on the right track," Li said. "The analysis might be a little more sophisticated than that or complicated than that." He said votes for, say, governor, don’t necessarily need to match representation of state legislative seats in order for election maps to be considered fair. "But you wouldn’t expect the disparities that you have," Li said, referring to North Carolina. Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, says people are better off determining redistricting bias by making apples-to-apples comparisons. "I don't think a discrepancy between partisan votes for higher office and seats held by a party in the legislature necessarily means anything," McGhee wrote in an email. "But a discrepancy between votes for the *legislature* and seats held in the legislature certainly can." There are 120 state House districts and 50 state Senate districts. More than 8.3 million votes were cast in those races. Democrats received a bit more than 3.7 million – 45 percent – and were 418,000 votes away from reaching 50 percent of the vote. When it comes to elections, 45 percent of the vote likely wouldn’t come close to qualifying for a recount. Whether it’s "nearly" 50 percent is subjective, said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. "But I probably wouldn’t use it if I was describing a 53/47 two-way split in the electorate," Murray said in an email. McGhee, the expert in California, said voters should also consider uncontested races when weighing the fairness of election maps. Fifteen of the state Senate’s 50 districts went uncontested, while 56 of the state House’s 120 districts were uncontested. That means 41 percent of legislators ran unopposed in the November elections. Our ruling Cooper’s claims about Democratic representation in the state House and state Senate are accurate. His claim that Democrats won close to 50 percent of votes is slightly exaggerated if only legislative races are considered, but is closer to the mark when it comes to broad support for Democratic candidates. We rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Roy Cooper	None	None	None	2017-08-09T16:24:06	2017-07-28	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-08353	Rick Perry is "taking money away from hurricane victims" and diverting it to "remodel the Governor's Mansion."	false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/27/back-basics/back-basics-group-says-rick-perry-diverting-hurric/	Back to Basics, the political committee that's poured money into ads critical of GOP Gov. Rick Perry, reminds Texans of Hurricane Ike in a TV spot linking hurricane aid to the reconstruction of the Governor's Mansion, which was heavily damaged in a 2008 arson fire. Perry, the narrator says, "doesn't want to explain why he took money away from hurricane victims." Say what? "Here's what he did," the narrator says in the ad that debuted online Oct. 13. "After begging for federal hurricane aid, Perry is taking millions of it to remodel the Governor's Mansion so he can move in faster. Diverting disaster funds for himself." In an online post, Back to Basics says the claim that Perry's taking millions in hurricane aid is based in part on a May 2009 news article in The Houston Chronicle and an Oct. 2, 2010, column by humorist John Kelso of the Austin American-Statesman. The Chronicle article said state lawmakers at that time were poised to spend $11 million in federal stimulus funds on mansion repairs. But stimulus money did not get allocated to the mansion project after all. Rather, as Kelso's recent column says, about "half of the money for the mansion project originated as money that the feds provided to Texas to reimburse the state for its upfront emergency expenses for Hurricane Ike. Follow the money: $11 million from the feds was shuffled from the Department of Public Safety to the State Preservation Board to help pay for the $22 million mansion remodel." The spending directive, House Bill 4586, was unanimously approved by the 2009 Legislature and signed into law by Perry. It authorizes up to $11 million in "reimbursements received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency" to be spent on "costs associated with the restoration of the Governor's Mansion." Separately, a Sept. 24 American-Statesman news article -- which Back to Basics refers to at the start of its ad -- quotes John Sneed, executive director of the State Preservation Board, saying that because the $11 million earmarked for mansion repair was federal aid, the mansion repair project wasn't hit by the 5 percent budget reduction state leaders (including Perry) have sought from agencies. (Sneed told us in an interview that he never termed the money federal aid; rather, he said, he said it was reimbursement money.) Takeaway: Legislators and Perry agreed to spend $11 million in federal reimbursements for hurricane assistance on mansion repairs. But is that Perry taking aid away from hurricane victims to hurry the mansion work? To gauge that, we followed the money. For starters, we learned, the Texas Department of Public Safety spent state dollars responding to Hurricane Ike, which lashed Texas in September 2008. It appears that its spending was later covered by a transfer of $145 million from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. In a February 2009 letter, leaders including Perry authorized the transfer of HHSC funds to the DPS "for the purpose of reimbursing emergency preparedness and response expenses incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike." The letter says the funds were available because the federal government failed to approve the state's waiver request for an effort to help low-income working Texans obtain private health coverage. DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange told us via e-mail that the DPS has spent nearly $106 million reimbursing vendors, cities and counties for Hurricane Ike expenses, while also returning $25 million to the HHSC. Mange said about $112 million has been set aside by FEMA to cover expenses the federal agency decides are eligible for reimbursement. Big picture: State spends more than $100 million in state money on hurricane. Federal government covers eligible expenditures--and state lawmakers earmark some of that reimbursement money for the mansion work. As we explored this history, we realized the ticklish issue for the Republican-led Legislature and Perry may have been the spectre of spending federal aid appropriated by the Democratic-controlled Congress with the support of the Democratic president, Barack Obama, on the mansion occupied by the Republican governor. Hence, Texas legislators dropped the idea of spending stimulus aid on the mansion project. State Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, recently acknowledged as much. In an Oct. 5 interview with the American-Statesman editorial board, Ogden said: "We didn't want to basically hard-wire (the mansion funding) in such a way that critics could say you used federal funds to rebuild the mansion. So we moved the money around." Allen Spelce, spokesman for the Texas state comptroller's office, told us the $11 million is considered state revenue because it made up for state-originated expenditures. Spelce pointed out too that the 2010-11 state budget shows no federal money going to the preservation board; its budget has two entries referring to the $11 million for the mansion work as general revenue, meaning state money. "It's different," Spelce told us, "than if this was some kind of federal grant, which is typically what you think of when you talk about federal funds." Katherine Cesinger, Perry's deputy press secretary, echoed Spelce, saying: "It's not being utilized for disasters, it's a reimbursement. You're splitting hairs here." We ran these interpretations past Back to Basics, whose executive director, Cliff Walker, insisted that the federal aid being used on the mansion was "originally intended to go toward reimbursement of those local communities and the public-assistance first responders" who helped victims of the hurricane. He also sent an e-mail stressing Sneed's September reference to the $11 million as federal aid. "As federal hurricane public assistance funds, then why have these dollars been used for the mansion? FEMA makes it clear that public assistance dollars are to be used to rebuild communities," Walker said. He referred us to a FEMA web page on the agency's Public Assistance Grant Program, which it says "provides supplemental federal disaster grant assistance for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned facilities and the facilities of certain Private Non-Profit (PNP) organizations." Our attempts to explore this with FEMA didn't yield an immediate interview. Our take: Whether the FEMA reimbursements to Texas amount to federal aid or not, the statement that Perry is "taking money away from hurricane victims" and diverting it to the mansion project is wrong on two fronts. First, FEMA set aside the money to cover agency costs already incurred in response to the hurricane; no victims are bereft as a result, far as we can tell. Secondly, the assignment of the funds to the mansion work was made by state lawmakers; Perry didn't earmark any money alone. We rate the statement False.

pomt-08518	In most Muslim countries, "We can't have a church. We're not able to build synagogues. It's forbidden."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/06/franklin-graham/rev-franklin-graham-says-churches-and-synagogues-a/	On ABC's This Week on Oct. 3, 2010, host Christiane Amanpour held a town hall debate on whether Americans should fear Islam. Naturally, the issue of the so-called Ground Zero mosque came up. Amanpour asked the Rev. Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, about his comments following 9-11 that Islam is a "very evil and very wicked" religion. "I understand what the Muslims want to do in America," said Graham, president of both the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) and the international Christian relief organization Samaritan's Purse. "They want to build as many mosques and cultural centers as they possibly can so they can convert as many Americans as they can to Islam. I understand that...I understand what they're doing. And I just don't have the freedom to do this in most Muslim countries. We can't have a church. We're not able to build synagogues. It's forbidden." Imam Osama Bahloul, leader of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, Tenn., and a panelist on the show, said Graham was incorrect. "For someone to say we are not allowed to build a church in a Muslim country, this is absolutely not right. You can Google this," Bahloul said. We spoke to several experts on religion and government in Muslim countries. And the consensus was clear: there are, in fact, Christian churches and/or synagogues in almost every Muslim country. "Reverend Graham is wrong," said Yvonne Haddad, Professor of History of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations at Georgetown University. "Churches are flourishing in Jordan and Syria. In Egypt, the Christians find restrictions on church construction which has recently been partially lifted." Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic relations, agreed that Graham was incorrect. "There are lots of Christian churches and synagogues in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Jordan, Indonesia, Qatar, Kuwait ... If you go to any number of so-called Muslim countries you will see thriving Christian and Jewish populations." One member of the Iranian parliament is Jewish, Hooper noted. "The only one where you don't see it, where you can't have a Christian church or synagogue is Saudi Arabia," Hooper said. "It's only an issue in Saudi Arabia." The cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia are considered the two holiest cities in Islam, explained Akbar S. Ahmed, chair of Islamic Studies at American University. And so, he said, no churches or synagogues are allowed there. "That is like the Vatican in terms of Catholicism," Ahmed said. But where he grew up in Pakistan, for example, Ahmed said, there is a huge Christian church. While there are now very few Christians left there, the building is deserted but remains untouched. After 1948, he said, most Jewish people living in Muslim countries migrated to Israel. But there are still many churches in Muslim countries, as well as synagogues. One of the top advisers to the king of Morocco is Jewish, he said. There may be periods of turmoil, or some narrow-minded leaders who have attacked churches over the years, Ahmed said, but there is nothing formalized in Islamic law that forbids the building of churches or synagogues. "Today, because of the general atmosphere in the air, there are many untruths being spread about Islam," Ahmed said. While the facts about whether most Muslim countries allow churches or synagogues is pretty cut-and-dried, there is another facet to this claim. Graham was speaking in the context of Muslims building mosques in order to convert people to Islam in the United States. And so we think it's fair to also look at whether it's possible to build a church or synagogue in most Muslim countries with the aim of converting people. And on that point, Graham is on firmer ground. According to a 2007 Council on Foreign Relations "backgrounder" on religious conversion and sharia law, authored by Lionel Beehner, "Conversion by Muslims to other faiths is forbidden under most interpretations of sharia and converts are considered apostates...Some Muslim clerics equate this apostasy to treason, a crime punishable by death." According to the report, while a vast majority of Muslim countries no longer prescribe death for apostates (instead opting for some lesser form of punishment), "some states, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, still do hand out death sentences." Shireen Hunter, visiting professor at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, said that Graham "cannot be more wrong," about there being a prohibition against churches or synagogues in most Muslim countries. But, she said, "conversion is a totally different thing." There is a great deal of debate in the Muslim community about Islamic law regarding conversions. Some argue Islam teaches there is no compulsion to faith. And while enforcement of religious laws against conversion is more aggressively applied by some Muslim countries than others, "this is an issue that is there." In many countries in the Middle East, religion dictates your legal status as well, explained Nathan Brown, an expert on Islamic law at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. While legal enforcement of bans against conversions from Islam are rare in most Muslim countries, "conversions are practically difficult," he said. We think a Catholic church recently built in Qatar is a good example of how this is handled. According to a March 2007 Al Jazeera story about the construction of a Catholic church: "Although the country's native inhabitants are entirely Muslim -- and are prohibited by law from converting to another faith -- the new Catholic church will cater to the large number of Christian migrants who have come to the Arabia Gulf state in search of work." Archbishop Paul Hinder, the Catholic Church's Bishop of Arabia, explained in the story that he oversees churches in Qatar, UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen and even in Saudi Arabia, "the birthplace of Islam, where Christianity is practiced behind closed doors." On the Christian communities in Saudi Arabia, Hinder clarified: "It's not an open church. Privately the Christians may gather in their houses in a very discreet manner." We think Graham erred when he said that in most Muslim countries, "We can't have a church. We're not able to build synagogues. It's forbidden." That's demonstrably false. The construction of churches is not forbidden in most Muslim countries, only Saudi Arabia. And so, on balance, we rate Graham's comment False.

pomt-08451	Says Scott Walker "eliminated his own office of economic development in the middle of this recession."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/15/tom-barrett/tom-barrett-says-gubernatorial-rival-scott-walker-/	In the wake of a major recession, and with state unemployment stubbornly high, there’s little surprise jobs have been a central focus in the Wisconsin governor’s race. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the Democratic nominee, is faulted by Republicans for job losses in the city. And Barrett is slamming Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, his GOP rival, for not doing enough from his office -- and even doing more harm than good. In a new television ad, titled "The Difference is Jobs," Barrett makes this claim: Scott Walker "eliminated his own office of economic development in the middle of this recession." That’s a pretty strong shot. But is it true? Let’s start with the recession piece of this: While economic times are still unquestionably tough, the official time frame for the Great Recession is December 2007 through June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The Barrett campaign is basing its claim on Walker’s two most recent budgets, for 2009 and 2010. In the 2009 budget, introduced in September 2008, Walker eliminated the county’s Economic Development Department, moved the seven staff members to other departments and downgraded the director position to a lower level bureaucrat. "We didn’t eliminate the office that office as much as reassign it," Walker said, when asked about the claim. He noted that the economic development activities already were limited -- such as handling real estate deals, low income housing and block grants. "It represents more of a realistic expectation of what the county is doing," Walker said at the time the office was moved. "We still very much want to play a role." In the fall of 2009, Walker switched gears and proposed creating a new county office of business development within his own office as part of the 2010 budget. He called for three staff members and a director. But the County Board approved only the position for the director, deleting the staffers. And it put the post in the Department of Transportation and Public Works. So, while the Barrett TV ad focuses on Walker’s action, it leaves out an important detail: the board’s involvement in approving -- or blocking -- the executive’s proposals. Additionally, the ad leaves the impression the county has played a large role in economic development. To be sure, there are economic development issues facing the county, from development of the County Grounds in Wauwatosa, to the sale of county land in the Park East Corridor in downtown Milwaukee, and increased interest in the area surrounding booming Mitchell International Airport. But the county has never placed as high a priority on economic development as the city, which has many more tools at its disposal to induce projects, including controls over zoning and the ability to create special tax financing districts. The Department of City Development is one of the most powerful -- and largest -- departments at City Hall. We turned to Bill Drew for a little insight. Drew is director of the Milwaukee County Research Park on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa. In the past, he served as commissioner of city development and also was director of administration for a time at the county, under former County Executive F. Thomas Ament’s administration. (He has contributed $1,000 to Walker’s gubernatorial campaign). What role should the county play? "The county has struggled to come up with an answer," Drew said. "We’ve been in and out of that business in one way or another since the early ’90s." The situation is exacerbated by fighting between the board and the executive. "It’s the culture of the institution that is causing a problem," Drew said. The board and executive have to agree "on the same vision and make a commitment that’s longer than one year." Drew said there hasn’t been a professional economic development specialist at the county since Tim Casey, now economic development coordinator in Brookfield, held the post in the 1990s. Under Walker, two of his recent selections to lead economic development efforts -- Bob Dennik and Tim Russell -- came from his campaign organization and didn’t last long. While Barrett’s claim is very specific -- on whether the department was eliminated -- it aims to make a broader point: That Walker has not done what he could have done when it comes to jobs. So we will delve a little deeper into how the position has been handled. After the battle over reinstating the office in 2010, Walker could have filled the position starting in January. In August, he hired Damon Dorsey. There was no official announcement of the hiring. It did not become public until it appeared on a County Board committee agenda. Most recently, Dorsey had worked for the administration of outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle on a proposed $810 million high-speed rail connection -- opposed by Walker -- between Milwaukee and Madison. He made $25 an hour, or $52,200 a year, to assist getting communities involved along the rail line. In the county job, he will make $80,500 a year. Dorsey is the former leader of the North Avenue Community Development Corp., which developed several apartment and retail buildings in the central city. In 2007, he developed a commercial building at N. 37th St. and W. North Ave. for a custard and burger stand called Scoopz that was publicly financed in part by the Milwaukee Economic Development Corp. and state Department of Commerce. The business closed after less than a year, and Dorsey and his wife, Maria, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2009. That case has since been closed. As part of the bankruptcy, Dorsey was required to take a personal financial management class, a routine hurdle required by federal law. Dorsey said the Scoopz experience shows that he understands the challenges facing businesses in this economic climate. "I’ve been on the front lines of the war," he said. "I’ve seen the blood." So, let’s return to the job -- and claim -- at hand. To draw a contrast on the critical issue of jobs, Tom Barrett says Scott Walker shut down his economic development office in the midst of a recession. The office did disappear, but in less than a year Walker was already trying to reinstate it -- though the County Board sliced back his plans. While the Barrett TV ad leaves the impression the county’s department was large, economic development has never been a major priority or function of the county. We rate Barrett’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-04735	Says Sherrod Brown voted "for the $1.17 trillion health care law that adds a new tax on Ohio manufacturers."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/30/crossroads-gps/crossroad-gps-says-117-trillion-health-care-law-sh/	Crossroads GPS, the conservative political advocacy group created by Karl Rove, is one of the top spenders among the third-party organizations targeting Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in his re-election battle with Republican Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel. A spin-off of the group American Crossroads, it has spent money most visibly on television ads attacking Brown's record. Among them is "Doing," a 30-second spot whose several claims include the assertion that Brown voted "for the 1.17 trillion dollar health care law that adds a new tax on Ohio manufacturers." PolitiFact Ohio wondered particularly about a tax aimed at manufacturing. We asked Crossroads how it supports its cost and tax claim. Crossroads pointed to a July report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The report says that the insurance coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act -- the healthcare law commonly known as Obamacare -- contains added costs of $1.17 trillion from 2012 to 2022, confirming the figure in the ad. The cost figures only paint part of the picture, however. The CBO report, and the staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, noted that the cost figures "do not include the budgetary impact of other provisions of the ACA, which in the aggregate reduce budget deficits." When assessing the overall cost of the health care law, the CBO said it could actually reduce budget deficits, because of its provisions that reduce net outlays and because of provisions that increase federal revenues. Those offset the added costs, and then some. One of those provisions is a 2.3-percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices. Crossroads GPS cites that as the "new tax on Ohio manufacturers," and notes that the Joint Committee on Taxation says it will generate $20 billion in revenue by 2020. The tax does not apply to devices made for export, or to eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids or other medical device "generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use," the law states. It applies to imported devices as well as those made domestically. In responding to our query, Crossroads GPS also pointed to a 2011 study financed by the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed. It said that the excise tax would cause 10 percent of device manufacturing to move offshore, leading to the loss of 43,000 U.S. jobs. An analysis by the research service Bloomberg Government, however, found that the trade group's study "is not credible." Bloomberg concluded that its assumptions conflict with economic research, overstate companies’ incentives to move jobs offshore, and ignore the positive effect of new demand created by the healthcare law. Crossroads GPS also cited an article in the Columbus Dispatch, "Medical-device makers fight tax," to show the tax's negative effects on jobs. But the same article notes that AdvaMed and industry officials "could not cite an example in Ohio of a company that has cut jobs or put growth plans on hold in anticipation of the tax." Where does that leave us? The ad's statement is partially accurate. The Crossroads ad puts an accurate figure on the 10-year net cost of the healthcare law. But the claim leaves out several important details. While there is a federal cost generated by the insurance requirements, overall the law would reduce federal deficits, according to the same reports that Crossroads cites. The law does include an excise tax on the sale of medical devices. Its impact is arguable. Dissenters say it could cost jobs and force business overseas. But portraying it broadly as "a new tax on Ohio manufacturers" over bills the scope of the tax. In Ohio, Crossroads said, about 20,000 workers are employed by makers of medical devices and equipment. Those jobs amout to about 3 percent of the more than 660,000 workers in Ohio that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says are employed in manufacturing. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.	None	Crossroads GPS	None	None	None	2012-08-30T06:00:00	2012-08-15	['Ohio']
