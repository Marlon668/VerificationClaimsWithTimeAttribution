pomt-05135	Says a national Coca-Cola study showed Texans love Texas more than residents of any other state love their state; Wisconsinites ranked second.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jun/22/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-national-coca-cola-study-showed-tex/	U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, keynoting the Republican Party of Texas convention in Fort Worth, linked pride in Texas and Wisconsin, his home state, telling delegates on June 9, 2012: "I remember reading a few years ago a story about how Coca-Cola did this big, exhaustive marketing study about how people love their states. First place: Texas. Second place: Wisconsin." We sought the skinny on that. By email, Ryan campaign spokesman Kevin Seifert replied: "Ryan's statement is fairly straightforward, Wisconsinites and Texans both love and are proud of their home states." Seifert also pointed us to an entry on the website of Worthpoint, which provides market data on art, antiques and collectibles including soda paraphernalia. The entry states that national focus groups run by Coca-Cola once found that Wisconsin and Texas natives most strongly identify with their states, and by a wide margin. Also, the entry says, Wisconsin and Texas were the only states the Coca-Cola company allowed to develop logos and advertising lines tying each state to the brand and the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Wisconsin "developed this program and used it for most of the decade of the nineties." Responding to our inquiry, a Worthpoint representative, Nathan Trapuzzano, pointed out by telephone that the online entry is a copy of a December 2006 eBay post related to the completed auction of a Coca-Cola jacket. "By putting it on our website, we’re not saying every word here is true," Trapuzzano said. We asked eBay to elaborate. By email, spokeswoman Kari Ramirez said eBay could not provide information on the person who posted that information. We also reached out to the Coca-Cola Company. Spokeswoman Kerry Tressler said that while the company's internal search for such a study came up dry, it is "likely possible that the study took place." In a follow-up email, Tressler said: "We launched a grassroots marketing effort in the early 1990s called ‘Coca-Cola Texas’ with a similar program in Wisconsin. Given the size and scope of that type of program, it is highly likely there was a marketing study at the time to validate the points of these campaigns." An online Nexis search led us to a Feb. 25, 1992, press release about Coca-Cola launching the Texas campaign, the "most comprehensive marketing initiative ever focusing on a single state." Separately, Seifert alerted us to a May 11, 1992, press release saying that up to 10 different radio spots would air in Wisconsin that year featuring a fictitious Coca-Cola truck driver touring the state to discover what "Wisconsin Proud" is all about. The release calls the campaign an extension of Coca-Cola’s "Wisconsin Proud" theme introduced, mainly on billboards, in 1989. We came up with nothing more potentially related to Ryan’s claim. You might say: That. Is. It. Our ruling We count on individuals who air claims to have factual backup. On this front, an unattributed eBay post about focus groups is insufficient. And while it’s believable that Coca-Cola ad campaigns launched 20 years ago drew on research, that does not demonstrate there was an exhaustive national study like the one described by Ryan. Ryan's claim still strikes us as having a touch of truth. As prideful Texans, we’re hat-in-hand sorry to rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-02985	"We’re 49th in the United States in new businesses created."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/20/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-second-last-business-for/	In her first extended TV interview, gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke downplayed the notion that Wisconsin’s tax climate is a roadblock to job growth that has lagged behind the national average. "We have to make sure we’re competitive with other states, but I’m not sure that’s a major factor," the Madison Democrat said Oct. 13, 2013 on WISN-TV’s Upfront with Mike Gousha show. "Companies look at qualified work force, being able to attract people to Wisconsin, the quality of life, the schools." One key to job growth, the former Trek Bicycle executive said, is to boost Wisconsin’s track record of developing new businesses. "Entrepreneurship is incredibly important to growing economies, and we’re 49th in the United States in new businesses created," Burke said. "So we have to make sure we’re supporting people starting their businesses, growing them and having the capital to do that." Is Wisconsin that close to scraping the bottom on business startups? It’s a particularly interesting question since Republican Gov. Scott Walker is emphasizing that more than 11,000 new business entities have formed since he took office in January 2011. That increase in net new formations, a 3 percent rise, is a positive economic sign but doesn’t say much about startups and new job creation because many of the new businesses are limited partnerships set up for legal or liability reasons and don’t employ anyone. That’s what we found in our recent Walk-O-Meter evaluation of Walker’s promise to create 10,000 new jobs. Digging into Burke’s numbers To back up her claim, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki pointed us to a study conducted annually by the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation. The foundation’s study, which is widely cited and known as the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, uses U.S. Census data to capture the number of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity. The 2013 study, based on 2012 data, found that Wisconsin had the third-lowest number of entrepreneurs per 100,000 people. It was ahead of only Nebraska and Minnesota, equivalent to a ranking of 48th. So Burke was very close to the mark based on the study. And Wisconsin’s recent history shows a similar performance -- rankings of 40, 49, 28 and 48 in the Kauffman Index from 2011 to 2008. Notably, back in 2000, only two states had better numbers than Wisconsin. "Entrepreneurial activity rates follow strong geographical patterns," the 2013 study said. "Entrepreneurial activity generally is highest in Western and Southern states and lowest in Midwestern and Northeastern states." We should note that the Kauffman Foundation warns that its study isn’t meant to provide a precise ranking of states. But its report in effect does that by reporting precise ratings and singling out states in the top five highest and lowest groups. To expand the picture, we spoke to Kauffman spokeswoman Barb Pruitt and two academic experts with deep experience in researching the rate of business startups. All agreed that the Kauffman index is just one way to measure entrepreneurship, and has some significant limitations. For instance, it counts a lot of part-time self-employed people who by definition don’t employ anyone else. Kauffman, it turns out, funds the U.S. Census Bureau program that produces a separate set of statistics that tally openings and closings at businesses with paid employees. The data is collected from business-registry statistics and employer payrolls. This data sheds more light on entrepreneurial activity, we were told by two leading researchers in this area, Scott Shane, professor of entrepreneurial studies and economics at Case Western Reserve University, and Zoltan Acs, director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Public Policy at George Mason University. Ian Hathaway, an economic advisor to Engine, a research and policy group for technology startups, analyzed 2011 data on openings and closings. He pointed us to a number that illustrates new business formation rate in each state. The results were identical to the Kauffman index report: Wisconsin was ahead of only two states. The same was true in 2010. An important note: Because of a time lag in Census reporting, the March 2011 snapshot is the latest available. That only covers a few months of Walker’s term. We asked Tom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, about Wisconsin’s track record on startups. "It’s an imperfect science but most indicators would confirm that Wisconsin ranks among the bottom 10 states for net company creation," Still said. "That may be explained, in part, because the recession started later in Wisconsin and ended later here, as well." Still said he’s optimistic the climate here is changing, but he added that future economic trends and public policy decisions on helping foster growth in startup-firms will play a big role. Finally, we found that Wisconsin looks better on a third measure: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures on the net number of "business establishments" in each state. In 2011, Wisconsin ranked 19th on its percentage increase over the year before, according to research by Economic Modeling Specialists Intl., a private firm that tracks labor-market trends. But EMSI and other experts say the BLS figures don’t reflect just new businesses; establishments can refer to new outlets or locations that existing businesses open up, for instance. Our rating In a discussion of how she would be different than Walker, Burke’s claim was that Wisconsin is "49th in the United States in new businesses created." Both the study she cited, as well as data seen as a better indicator of startup activity, put Wisconsin at 48th, not 49th. The data is somewhat dated, covering only part of Walker’s time, but is the latest available. With those clarifications, we rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-13733	Says Donald Trump "said a woman should be punished for exercising her right to choose."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/barbara-boxer/dnc-barbara-boxer-says-trump-said-women-should-be-/	Women’s issues were a major theme of the Democratic National Convention’s second day — the same day the party officially nominated Hillary Clinton, making her the first female presidential nominee from a major party. Convention speakers contrasted Clinton with her opponent, Donald Trump, whose comments about women have been widely noted. "Her opponent said a woman should be ‘punished’ for exercising her right to choose and then picked a running mate who believes Roe vs. Wade belongs, to quote him, ‘in the ash heap of history,' " said California Sen. Barbara Boxer, speaking of Trump and his vice presidential pick Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Trump’s position on abortion is hard to pin down. Throughout this election cycle, he has said he is against abortion, with exceptions. But in prior years, he has called himself "very pro-choice." So it’s easy for Trump’s opponents on either side of the issue to criticize his position. Along the same lines, Boxer’s claim that Trump said women should be "punished" for having an abortion is a selective reading of Trump’s comments, which have shifted. He did say that women should be punished for having an abortion, but he walked back his comments the very same day. "He said it, she heard it," said Boxer Press Secretary Peter True. What Trump said Trump made the comments at issue during a March 30, 2016, conversation with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. Here are two relevant portions of the conversation. (Read more here.) MATTHEWS: "No, should the woman be punished for having an abortion?" TRUMP: "Look..." MATTHEWS: "This is not something you can dodge." TRUMP: "It’s a — no, no..." MATTHEWS: "If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under law. Should abortion be punished?" TRUMP: "Well, people in certain parts of the Republican Party and conservative Republicans would say, ‘yes, they should be punished.’ " MATTHEWS: "How about you?" TRUMP: "I would say that it’s a very serious problem. And it’s a problem that we have to decide on. It’s very hard." … MATTHEWS: "Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no as a principle?" TRUMP: "The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment." MATTHEWS: "For the woman." TRUMP: "Yeah, there has to be some form." MATTHEWS: "Ten cents? Ten years? What?" TRUMP: "I don’t know. That I don’t know. That I don’t know." The gist is that Trump said he believed there should be "some form of punishment" for the woman. But he quickly walked back those comments. What Trump said later After an outcry about his remarks that same day, Trump’s campaign released a statement saying he meant that the person who performed the abortion would face consequences if Congress passed a law banning the procedure. The statement read: "If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb." In a March 31 Fox News interview, Trump said it’s possible he "misspoke" in his conversation with Matthews, adding that it had been a "convoluted discussion." "If, in fact, abortion was outlawed, the person performing the abortion, the doctor or whoever it may be that is really doing the act is responsible for the act, not the woman is responsible," Trump said. "So, that's the way I have always felt." As our friends at Snopes have noted, it’s not like Trump is or was a forceful advocate for punishing women for abortion who then flipped his position suddenly. Trump was responding to a hypothetical question that Matthews posed — a question he first tried to dodge — about laws banning abortion that don’t currently exist. He retracted the comment soon after. Our ruling Boxer said Trump "said a woman should be punished for exercising her right to choose." Trump did say something to this effect, but within a matter of hours, he clarified his comments. Trump said he meant doctors should be punished for providing abortions, not women who undergo the procedure. In rating this claim, we find Trump’s comments contradictory. Yes, he mentioned punishment, but his campaign retracted that statement. There’s no evidence this was a long-held position. Boxer’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6e3732c3-0674-40c9-b479-b615b7a35c81	None	Barbara Boxer	None	None	None	2016-07-26T23:02:12	2016-07-26	['None']
pomt-14559	"We bailed out" Johnson Controls when "we saved the auto industry" and "now they want to avoid paying taxes."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/11/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-johnson-controls-got-federal-/	In late 2015, Johnson Controls Inc. absorbed a wave of unwelcomed headlines after a federal prosecutor said its CEO offered to pay $20 million restitution on behalf of a notorious Ponzi schemer. The world's leading maker of car batteries, and a manufacturer of heating and cooling equipment and controls, wasn’t used to such sensational stuff. Then on Feb. 4, 2016 -- less than two weeks after Johnson Controls announced it would move its headquarters from suburban Milwaukee to Cork, Ireland, as part of a merger with Tyco International -- the typically low-key company was smacked again, on national television, by Hillary Clinton. At an MSNBC-hosted presidential debate in New Hampshire, Clinton criticized Johnson Controls as something of a pork barreling tax evader. Alluding to her rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton said: "Look at what I am proposing, and — we have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. "I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an auto parts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes." The next Democratic debate is Feb. 11, 2016 in Johnson Controls’ home territory, hosted by PBS at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. And it’s possible we’ll hear a repeat of Clinton’s attack. So let’s assess of both parts her claim. Bailbout background Clinton’s reference to a bailout was a bit muddled. Unlike big automakers, Johnson Controls wasn’t facing bankruptcy back in 2008. But it did benefit -- indirectly -- from a federal bailout of the auto industry. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported a week before Clinton made her claim: Johnson Controls Inc. was as patriotic as they come back in 2008, when the U.S. auto industry was teetering on bankruptcy and the company knew it desperately needed help from U.S. taxpayers. The company's president at the time, Keith Wandell, didn't hesitate to ask Congress to support the massive government bailout that ultimately rescued two major U.S. automakers, along with uncounted businesses that provide parts and services to them. "It saved a whole lot of suppliers that would have gone out of business," said Steve Roell, then Johnson Controls' chief executive. In 2008, of course, the entire auto industry was in very bad shape as the recession took hold. Layoffs at auto plants and among auto parts suppliers were on track to reach 250,000 workers. General Motors was virtually out of cash to pay its bills and Chrysler was not far behind. In December 2008, President George W. Bush used $17.6 billion in TARP money to keep GM and Chrysler afloat. And in 2009, President Barack Obama continued the rescue of the two automakers that was financed with about $80 billion in taxpayer money. Clinton’s campaign notes that the Obama White House has touted the importance of the auto bailout beyond General Motors and Chrysler. In a statement in 2011 that mentioned Johnson Controls, the White House said: GM and Chrysler were supported by a vast network of auto suppliers, which employed three times as many workers and depended on the auto companies business to survive. An uncontrolled liquidation of a major automaker would have had a cascading impact throughout the supply chain, causing failures and job loss on a larger scale. Johnson Controls, meanwhile, has acknowledged that Wandell had "encouraged the Congress to support the automakers, noting that failure of even one of them would have devastating consequences for many U.S. suppliers." But the company emphasized that it did not receive any of the auto bailout money. So, while the money went to the automakers, part of the intent was to help businesses that supply them, as well. The taxes As we noted, Johnson Controls itself has said that the move of its headquarters to Ireland will save $150 million per year in taxes. With the so-called inversion -- in this case, Johnson Controls relocating its headquarters outside the U.S. through being acquired by Tyco -- lets a company pay corporate income taxes on its overseas earnings at the tax rate of its new home country. At 35 percent, the United States’ statutory corporate rate -- that is, before deductions -- is the highest among developed countries. In Ireland, the corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent. Clinton, Sanders and others have decried inversions, while some Republicans, including Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, have said the moves are evidence that corporate tax rates in the United States are too high. New York Times commentator Andrew Ross Sorkin, while lamenting the inversions, has said: "Ultimately, the only way inversions will stop is when the corporate tax code changes so it becomes more attractive for American companies to be American companies. A Johnson Controls spokesman did not respond to our requests for comment. The company has said its move was not a tax-driven transaction, but was being done for strategic reasons, with the aim of the merger with Tyco being "to build the best industrial company we can." But the company hasn’t disputed the tax benefits. Our rating Clinton said "we bailed out" Johnson Controls when "we saved the auto industry" and "now they want to avoid paying taxes." Johnson Controls was not a direct recipient of the 2008-’09 federal bailouts of the auto industry, but it did push for the funds and, as an auto parts supplier, benefited indirectly. On federal taxes, the company has said it will save $150 million per year by moving its headquarters from suburban Milwaukee to Ireland. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-02-11T05:00:00	2016-02-04	['None']
pomt-08194	Since the Fed was created in 1913, "the U.S. Dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/24/virginia-tea-party-patriots/virginia-tea-party-says-dollar-has-lost-98-percent/	The Tea Party is no fan of the Fed. In a pointed letter to Virginia's Congressional delegation, the Virginia Tea Party Patriot Federation recently called for an audit of the Federal Reserve System, blaming the bank for pushing the nation further into debt and devaluing the dollar. The letter comes in response to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s plan to buy $600 billion in additional U.S. Treasury bonds. "The Fed, which was created and initially funded with taxpayer gold and monies by an Act of Congress, is opaque and operates in secrecy. It has done so since its inception in 1913," the letter reads. "Since that time, the U.S. Dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power. We believe that this alone is compelling reason enough to tear down the veil and audit the Fed. Chairman Bernanke's recent actions make the need for this audit all the more urgent." Upon hearing the 98 percent number we wondered two things: 1) Really? 2) And if so, is it all the Fed’s fault? Asked how they arrived at their conclusion, the letter’s co-authors said they used gold. "In 1913 the official price of an ounce of gold was $20.64. Today, an ounce of gold buys $1,370. That is an increase in the price of gold of some 6,530%; seen another way, the value of the dollar versus gold has fallen 98.5 percent," explained Jamie Jacoby with the Richmond Tea Party. Those numbers do check out. But they are meaningless, according to C. Barry Pfitzner, a professor of economics at Randolph-Macon College. Pfitzner noted that the U.S. is no longer on the gold standard, which ended in 1914. Even the gold "exchange" standard -- under which official holders of dollars like foreign banks and treasuries could convert dollar holdings to gold -- ended in 1971. "The current market gold price is nothing more than the equivalent of any other speculative commodity. Not unlike, say, silver, diamonds, platinum -- or for that matter, hog futures," Pfitzner said. "So one could argue that the dollar has lost 98 percent of its power to purchase gold. So what? Irrelevant. And the Fed is not to blame. It does not control the price of gold." Dean Croushore, chair of the economic department in University of Richmond’s Robins School of Business, agreed. "Economists generally think of purchasing power as the amount of goods that a person can buy with a dollar, not the amount of gold that a person can buy with a dollar," he said. "Measuring the amount of goods that one can buy with a dollar is best done using a price index, such as the consumer price index." Well, that’s easy enough. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, a dollar in 1913 had the same buying power as $22.09 today, about a 95 percent decline. Rather than the gold standard, the BLS calculator uses the average Consumer Price Index for a given calendar year. That data represents changes in prices of all goods and services purchased for consumption by urban households. Now, on to the next point. Is the Fed really responsible for the dollar's decline in value over 90-plus years? "That is not a great record and the blame does belong with the Federal Reserve, especially in the high inflation years from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s," Croushore said. He added that the Fed’s record "improved in the past 20 years, when the average annual inflation rate has been 2.5 percent." Pfitzner noted two problems with putting all the blame on the Fed: the change in what money is used for and the difference in incomes. "No economist would argue that the index from 1913 is comparable to the index in 2010," Pfitzner said. "The mix of goods that consumers purchase is entirely different." As to his second point, the annual income per person today is about $33,000 today, compared to about $400 in 1913. So while the dollar is worth far less today, we have far more of them to spend. "If we blame the Fed for inflation (and the taming of inflation in recent decades), seems they should also get some credit for growth in real incomes," Pfitzner said. Barry Bosworth, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, said the Federal Reserve isn't responsible for the U.S. dollar's value, which he called "pretty constant" relative to other currencies. "The decline in the value of the dollar is the result of inflation, but advocates of the gold standard may argue that it could have been avoided if the U.S. had stayed on the gold standard, so they blame the Federal Reserve Bank," Bosworth said. So let’s look back over the facts. No doubt, the value of a dollar has plummeted since 1913, when milk cost eight cents a quart. The Tea Party’s says the buck has dropped by 98 percent, but its use of the gold standard to measure the greenback is not a relevant gauge. Using the Consumer Price index, as many economists recommend, we find the dollar fell by 95 percent since 1913. So the Tea Party, despite its disputed methods, wound up with a figure that’s in the ballpark. But in bemoaning the drop in value of a dollar, the Tea Party omits a huge mitigating factor: salaries have grown enormously since 1913 and consumers have more to spend. If the Fed’s historic handling of inflation is to be blamed for the drop in the dollar, it must be credited for the rise in wages. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-06664	"When you look at what we have done over the last decade, we created 1 million jobs in the state of Texas. At the same time, (the rest of) America lost 2.5 million."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/11/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-due-what-weve-done-we-created-1-mi/	Gov. Rick Perry, who trumpets his job creation know-how, has a new favorite factoid about Texas job gains. He revisited it at the top of the Sept. 7 Republican presidential debate at the Reagan library in California after NBC News anchor Brian Williams asked whether Texas, with its poverty rates and highest-in-the-nation share of minimum-wage workers, is the "kind of answer Americans are looking for." "Actually, what Americans are looking for is someone who can get this country working again," Perry replied. "And we put the model in place in the state of Texas. When you look at what we have done over the last decade, we created 1 million jobs in the state of Texas. At the same time, America lost 2.5 million." Texas created 1 million jobs while the country shed 2.5 million—because of what "we" did? Granted, Texas has enjoyed phenomenal job growth over most of the time Perry has been governor, though how much came due to his leadership is debatable. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney hinted as much in the debate, saying: "Texas is a great state. Texas has zero income tax. Texas has a right to work state, a Republican Legislature, a Republican Supreme Court. Texas has a lot of oil and gas in the ground," Romney said. "Those are wonderful things, but Gov. Perry doesn't believe that he created those things." In a post-debate interview, economist Thomas Saving, director of Texas A&M University’s Private Enterprise Research Center, chimed in that Texas has relatively low state debt and endured less of a housing bubble than many states. Still, he said, the state’s economy might have been strong over the past decade regardless of who was governor. Pia Orrenius, an economist for the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve Bank, told us in a June interview that the Texas economy has been roaring since 1990. "Long before Rick Perry" became governor, she said, "we were talking about the great Texas economy. There are so many exciting things about the Texas economy that precede any political flavor of the month." She listed as favorable factors the state’s range of natural resources, its energy and high-tech sectors, its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China. Also, we recognize that job-gain claims can overreach. An example: Perry’s January 2009 claim that about 70 percent of the U.S. jobs created between November 2007 and November 2008 were in Texas. We rated that claim False because the percentage was based on comparing new jobs in Texas with new jobs in 13 other states and the District of Columbia where job gains outnumbered losses; it ignored jobs created in 36 states where job losses overall outnumbered gains. Back to the present: Perry debuted his latest Texas-versus-the nation jobs’ boast at an Iowa campaign stop in August. Afterward, Perry’s campaign told us it compared the total number of non-farm jobs in Texas versus the rest of the nation for December 2000, when Perry became governor, and July 2011. Such figures are tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In December 2000, Texas had 9,537,900 jobs, while the other 49 states and the District of Columbia had 123,032,200, Perry spokesman Mark Miner said. And in July 2011, Texas had 10,619,800 jobs while the rest of the county had 120,577,500. So, Miner said, Texas had 1,081,900 more jobs than it did in late 2000 while the rest of the country had 2,454,700 fewer jobs. By email, bureau economist Lindsay Davis told us those numbers are accurate. So, Texas ended up with a lot more jobs than before, and other states, together, accounted for even more net job losses. Specifically, Texas was among more than 20 states with net job gains in the period, while more than 25 states landed up with net job losses. In raw numbers, the net job losers were topped by California and Ohio, which together accounted for about 1.1 million fewer jobs. Michigan experienced the nation’s greatest percentage slide, more than 15 percent. Conversely, while Texas had the greatest raw job gain, its 11.3 percent growth rate for the period was less than the percentage increases for Utah, Alaska, Wyoming and North Dakota, which led the nation with a 21 percent increase. Side note: The number of full-time positions in Texas state government went up about 7 percent from 2000 to 2010, according to the Legislative Budget Board’s Fiscal Size-up reports, from 222,685 to more than 238,404. Providing out-of-state perspective on Perry’s comparison, Lee McPheters, director of the Economic Outlook Center at Arizona State University, said by email that it’s natural that the most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — also would generate big raw job gains and losses. It’s also crucial to notice the time period being analyzed, he said. For instance, Florida outpaced Texas in job growth from 2000 and 2007, he said, but then lost jobs for three years. Texas experienced steady job losses in a shorter period, from late 2008 through 2009. He wrote: "So the difference is in the recent years, where states such as Florida and California dropped out of the job growth derby while Texas continued to add jobs in 2010 and into 2011." So, how does Perry's comparison stand up? At a glance, it reflects the health of the Texas economy in his time as governor and the state’s perpetual outsize significance in terms of raw job counts. Yet there's also a meaningful weakness in such a comparison. The governor of any state with net job gains in the period over the past decade could make a similar declaration, leaving the misimpression that just their state gained jobs while the rest of the country lost jobs. In this vein, for instance, Alaska created 43,700 jobs while the rest of America lost 1.4 million. Left out of this formulation is that 20-plus other states also had job gains. Also, as experts note, the Texas economy was rocking before Perry became governor. Romney’s point sticks; most of each state’s economic circumstances—in Texas' case: no state income tax and vast natural resources, for starters—aren’t set by the governor.

Today, they pay 22 cents for every $1 by a worker."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/03/facebook-posts/facebook-post-compares-corporate-individual-tax-bu/	A reader recently forwarded us a Facebook post that sought to blame corporations for not carrying their fair share of the tax burden. It read, "According to the Office of Management and Budget, back in 1950, corporations paid $3 in taxes for every $1 by a worker. Today, they pay 22 cents for every $1 by a worker." We wondered whether that was true. The Facebook post was credited to an activist group called "The Other 98 Percent," which describes itself as at the forefront of a "new movement to kick corporate lobbyists out of D.C., hold our elected officials accountable, and fix our democracy to make Washington work for the other 98% of us." We tried to reach the group through its website but did not receive a response. The Facebook post cited the Office of Management and Budget -- the executive branch’s budget-policy arm -- but it didn’t get any more specific than that. When we went to OMB’s website, we found some historical data that addresses this claim. The simplest ratio to use is the ratio of corporate income taxes paid to individual income taxes paid. In 1950, corporations paid 66 cents in income taxes for every dollar of income taxes paid by individuals -- nowhere near the ratio claimed in the Facebook post. In 2011, corporations paid 17 cents in income taxes for every dollar in income taxes paid by individuals. That’s not exactly 22 cents, but it’s in the ballpark. By this measurement, then, the Facebook post is misleading. It’s true that the share of income taxes paid by corporations has declined over the years, but not as dramatically as the post suggests. In addition, it was never the case in 1950 that corporate income taxes even equaled the level of individual income tax revenues, much less tripled them. You can also use a more detailed ratio. Under this formula, total corporate taxes consists of corporate income taxes plus the employer’s share of payroll taxes. Individual taxes consist of individual income taxes, plus the employee’s share of the payroll tax, plus excise taxes (such as levies on alcohol, tobacco, telecommunications and gasoline), plus the estate tax. Using this formula, the ratio in 1950 was 48 cents paid by corporations for every dollar paid by workers -- even more incorrect than it was using our first calculation. In 2011, the ratio was 37 cents paid by corporations for every dollar by workers. So using these numbers, the Facebook post is misleading as well. "The assertion is plain wrong," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. "This seems to be a very flippant comment without any basis," agreed William McBride, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax issues. Part of the reason for the shift from corporate taxes to individual taxes is that a significant chunk of individual taxes are actually, in effect, business taxes, since more business owners have chosen to be taxed as individuals rather than as corporations, McBride said. If it were possible to reliably separate out such taxes and shift them from the individual column to the corporate column, the premise of the Facebook post would likely be further weakened. Our ruling The one thing the Facebook claim gets right is that corporations are carrying less of the burden for taxation now compared to 1950. But the difference is not nearly as dramatic as the Facebook post indicates, and its numbers are wide of the mark. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-10685	"When Pakistan erupted in crisis, I spoke to Musharraf before Bush did."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/12/joe-biden/yes-biden-spoke-first-/	A new TV ad from Joe Biden returns to the core theme of his campaign, that the Delaware senator has lots of experience with foreign policy. The no-frills ad features Biden in front of a dark curtain, talking into the camera. "Being president is not the same thing as running for president," he says. "When this campaign is over, political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing. The next president has to act. The Biden plan to end the war in Iraq has already won bipartisan support. When Pakistan erupted in crisis, I spoke to Musharraf before Bush did. You don't have to guess what I'll do as president. Just look at what I've done." We have previously explored Biden's claims about his Iraq plan, so here we will focus on his statement that when Pakistan erupted, he spoke with President Pervez Musharraf before Bush did. Indeed, Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke with Musharraf on Nov. 6, according to a statement from his office that day and wide news coverage of contacts with Musharraf. In the statement, Biden described it as "a very frank and detailed discussion. I told President Musharraf how critical it is for relations between our two countries that elections go forward as planned in January, that he follow through on his commitment to take off his uniform and that he restore the rule of law to Pakistan." President Bush spoke with Musharraf on Nov. 7, one day after Biden did. At a press availability that day at Mount Vernon, Bush's remarks were very similar to Biden's the day before. "My message was that we believe strongly in elections, and that you ought to have elections soon, and you need to take off your uniform," Bush said. "You can't be the president and the head of the military at the same time. So I had a very frank discussion with him." It's not clear why Bush didn't speak with Musharraf until after Biden, but the records indicate that Biden's claim is True.

pomt-06593	"In the past six years alone, changes to the pension formula … have saved over half a billion dollars."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/sep/25/rhode-island-retirement-security-coalition/ri-public-employee-unions-say-changes-states-pensi/	A coalition of Rhode Island’s public employees unions waging a campaign to protect its members’ pension benefits recently posted a YouTube video "tutorial’’ entitled "The Rhode Island Pension Problem And Why You Need To Fight For Your Pension Now." Among the more provocative takeaways of the 10-minute video is the claim that over the past six years, changes to the state’s pension plan "have saved over half a billion dollars." The video’s message -- that state employees have already given up over a half-billion dollars in benefits and are now being asked to give up a lot more -- is likely to make anyone with a state pension want to grab a picket sign and head for the State House rotunda. So we wanted to know: have changes to the state pension system already "saved" the state $500 million? First, some background. The cost to Rhode Island taxpayers of funding the state-run pensions for public employees has more than doubled during the last seven years, and actuaries say it could double again by 2013. The state hasn’t set aside enough money to pay for those pensions. The current shortfall -- or "unfunded liability" -- is estimated at more than $7 billion. Taxpayers face another $2 billion shortfall for municipal pension plans not run by the state. State General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, who has been leading the effort to address the problem, and Governor Chafee are expected to present a plan to the General Assembly, which is expected to reconvene to deal with the matter in October. In the video, a "teacher" (played by Providence actress Kate Lohman) scribbles her pension lesson on a giant white board. (Is it just a coincidence, we wondered, that Lohman’s short, dark hair and tailored blouse give her a passing resemblance to Raimondo?) The video was produced by consultant Brad Dufault for the Rhode Island Retirement Security Coalition, which represents nine public employees’ unions whose members include teachers, police officers, fire fighters, correctional officers, and state and municipal employees. Posted Sept. 9, the video coincided with the coalition’s launch of a "fight back" campaign over the effort to pull the state’s pension system back from the brink of insolvency. Among the solutions being floated for the state pension system -- which covers more than 50,000 employees and retirees -- are freezing cost of living increases and offering new employees a hybrid pension/401(k) plan. In the video, the actress at the white board makes her case that state employees have already sacrificed for the sake of savings. "In fact, in the past six years alone,’’ she says, "changes to the pension formula we told you about earlier have saved over half a billion dollars.’’ Indeed, the General Assembly has rolled back pension benefits three times since 2005. The changes include raising the retirement age, reducing the size of pensions, and trimming cost-of-living allowances, among other things. But did those changes save $500 million? To check, we started by contacting George Nee, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, to find out where the number came from. He sent us a screen shot from a Sept. 12, 2011, presentation to the state Senate from the actuary and consultant for the state’s pension system, Joseph P. Newton, of Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company. The screen shot shows a bullet point that reads: "Total estimated reduction in value as of June 30, 2010: $500 M (State Employees Only.)" To understand what that means we called Newton. He explained that the $500 million is an estimate as of June 30, 2010 of the projected savings from changes to the pension plan for state employees over the participants’ lifetime. In other words, the estimated $500 million savings wouldn’t be realized until every single one of the participants in the plan as of June 30, 2010, along with their beneficiaries, has died. (The projected savings, in this case, is only for the pension plan that covers state employees, not teachers, judges or municipal employees.) How much of the $500 million in projected savings has been realized to date? That figure hasn’t been calculated, Newton said. However, he said, it would no doubt be a "much smaller number." The irony is that the same unions which say in the video that their members have been "giving back" benefits worth over a half a billion dollars during the last six years also are suing the state to try to recoup some of those lost benefits. In their suit, filed last summer in Superior Court, Providence, the unions challenge reductions in pension benefits enacted by the General Assembly in 2009 and 2010, saying the changes are unconstitutional and infringe upon their members’ contractual rights. If the unions prevail, there’s no telling when, or if, the state would ever realize the half-billion dollars in savings. (The unions won an initial round in their challenge, but it’s far from over.) In summary, the union video accurately describes changes to the state pension plan which are projected to save the state more than a half-billion dollars over the lifetime of the beneficiaries. But the claim that the money has been "saved" misconstrues a projected savings as an actual savings. In reality, the total savings wouldn’t be realized for decades. For that reason, we rule the statement as Mostly False.	None	Rhode Island Retirement Security Coalition	None	None	None	2011-09-25T00:01:00	2011-09-09	['None']
pomt-03741	"Pasco County has the second highest population of homeless in all of Florida."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/apr/10/brian-anderson/pasco-county-has-states-second-highest-homeless-po/	For Tampa Bay residents, the state’s homeless crisis hits home harder than you may think. Discussion of a measure that would allow people applying for or renewing driver’s licenses or motor vehicle registrations to make $1 donations to homeless outreach programs sparked an interesting claim from a Pasco County resident. "Pasco County has the second highest population of homeless in all of Florida," said Brian Anderson, a homeless advocate from Hudson, on April 9, 2013, before the Senate Rules Committee. Anderson, 30, is a 10-year Army veteran who moved to Hudson in May 2012 to attend Saint Leo University and study social work. He said he just received approval from the Pasco County Commission to hold a "Stand Down" event for homeless veterans transitioning into civilian life at Veterans Memorial Park in September 2013. "We have an epidemic," he said of homelessness. PolitiFact Florida was skeptical of Pasco being the No. 2 county in Florida for homelessness. Wouldn’t the number of homeless people be higher in counties with substantially more people, such as Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach? To find out, we consulted the 2012 report of the Florida Council on Homelessness, which makes recommendations to the governor and Legislature for addressing the prevalence of homeless adults and children in Florida. The latest report, submitted June 2012, says families with children are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. In 2012, local homeless coalitions counted 54,300 homeless people living in shelters or on the street on one day and one night in January. Before we get into the data, we’ll stress that the totals are imperfect. Not every county, especially rural counties, has the resources to spread out and tally homeless residents. Still, the report offers the best snapshot we have of how to count the homeless. The homeless count is required every two years by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to receive grants for addressing the homeless problem. Using the 2012 report, we found the homeless counts for the biggest counties in the state. In the chart below, we added in the county’s estimated 2012 population as a point of comparison using U.S. Census Bureau data. 2009 2011 2012 Est. 2012 pop. Broward 4,154 3,801 3,801 1,815,137 Duval 3,244 4,284 2,533 879,602 Hillsborough 7,473 7,336 7,336 1,277,746 Miami-Dade 4,333 3,777 3,817 2,591,035 Orange 2,281 2,872 2,281 1,202,234 Palm Beach 2,147 2,148 2,148 1,356,545 Pasco 4,527 4,442 4,502 470,391 Pinellas 4,163 3,971 3,890 921,319 Statewide 57,687 56,771 54,972 19,317,568 Hillsborough County, by a large margin, has the most homeless residents. In second, over more populous counties, is Pasco, at 4,442 residents in 2011 and 4,502 residents in 2012. (Not all counties count the homeless in even years, so some 2012 numbers are repeated from 2011.) Count George Romagnoli, manager of Pasco County’s Community Development Division, as a skeptic. He can’t understand how counties five times bigger than Pasco have lower homeless populations. "It just doesn’t make sense for a county with a population under 500,000," he said. "It’s a hard statement to comprehend." For the most part, Pasco’s homeless live in the woods, Romagnoli said. Law enforcement advised volunteers not to go as far back into the woods to conduct their count in 2013 because of a couple recent murders, so Romagnoli expects the county’s 2013 total will be lower. Rep. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, said he has noticed an increase in people reaching out to his office in recent years because they lost their house. "It’s surprising to me," he said when told about the state’s high homeless count. The higher-than-expected figure may have more to do with how aggressive local coalitions and their volunteers are in getting accurate figures, said Tom Pierce, executive director of the state’s Office on Homelessness. The coalitions need to do the legwork to figure out where the homeless are in advance of the biennial count, he said. A more accurate way to describe the figure may be "reported homeless population." "It’s obviously fraught with its own limitations, but it’s the best we’ve got," Pierce said. As for Miami-Dade, the county has been effective getting more homeless people into permanent housing units. Miami-Dade gets more money from the federal government because it raises more money for homeless initiatives from a 1 percent sales tax on food and alcoholic beverage purchases at restaurants and bars. Miami-Dade passed the tax in 1993. "Our community has had no political will to advance that," said Lesa Weikel, Homeless Coalition of Hillsborough County spokeswoman. She wanted to dispute a myth that homeless people come to Florida from other states because of the warm weather. In 2009 and 2011, volunteers asked homeless people in what state did they become homeless. In 2009, 88 percent said Florida. In 2011, it was 90 percent. Pasco County has many programs aimed at curbing the homeless program, such as offering hotel vouchers for families, placing people in jobs suited for each person's abilities and criminal record, and offering bus rides to work, said Rev. Jim Campbell, president of the Coalition for the Homeless of Pasco County. Our ruling A homeless advocate named Brian Anderson came to Tallahassee to support a bill that would allow people at the DMV to check a box indicating they wanted to donate $1 to homeless programs. Anderson, of Hudson, evoked his home county in his plea, saying "Pasco County has the second highest population of homeless in all of Florida." Anderson accurately cites the state’s 2012 county-by-county homeless population report. However, there is enough skepticism about the count itself that we think it’s best to proceed with caution. As such, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Brian Anderson	None	None	None	2013-04-10T14:45:57	2013-04-09	['Pasco_County,_Florida']
pomt-06571	The Postal Service’s financial losses result from "a 2006 law that drains $5 billion a year from post office revenue, while the Postal Service is forced to overpay billions more into federal accounts."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/29/save-americas-postal-service/ad-save-americas-postal-service-claims-rule-congre/	The U.S. Postal Service is having financial problems, but "not for the reason you might think," says a new ad from unions representing postal workers. "The Postal Service is critical to our economy – delivering mail, medicine and packages," the ad says. "Yet they’re closing thousands of offices, slashing service, and want to lay off over 100,000 workers. The Postal Service is reporting financial losses but not for reasons you might think. The problem: a burden no other agency or company bears, a 2006 law that drains $5 billion a year from post office revenue, while the Postal Service is forced to overpay billions more into federal accounts. Congress created this problem, and Congress can fix it." The ad makes it sound so simple -- if only Congress would fix the unfair law making the post office pay the federal government. But our research showed the post office had more problems than just the financial requirements of a 2006 law. To begin with, the U.S. Postal Service is a unique agency. It's meant to be self-sustaining, paying for itself from the money it makes off postage and other mail services. But unlike a private business, it has to follow rules set by Congress that result in higher costs, such as universal delivery. In recent years, as Internet communication has increased, the number of pieces mailed has been in decline. For a few years, postal revenues were nevertheless stable, but then they too started to decline. Patrick Donahoe, the U.S. Postmaster, said recently that first-class mail is dropping at a rate of 7.5 percent a year. While the post office has made up for some losses through productivity increases, it hasn't been able to make up enough. That has the post office looking for ways to save money and increase revenues, and for most significant changes, it has to get permission from Congress. Just as the ad says, the post office has floated the idea of closing smaller post offices, cutting Saturday service and laying off workers. Others have suggested that the post office get into new lines of business, but again, the Postal Service would need permission from Congress. The ad is also largely correct that a 2006 law, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, requires the post office to make payments "into federal accounts." What the ad doesn't mention is the payments are meant to fund health benefits for future Postal Service retirees. The law requires that the Postal Service pay about $5 billion a year toward future health benefits for 10 years, until 2017. A 2009 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service determined that the payments were having a "considerable" impact on the post office's profitability. The ad also mentions "billions" that the Postal Service is "forced to overpay" into federal accounts. This claim has to do with whether the Postal Service is required to pay more than needed for future pension benefits, and there's a lively debate over the issue. Inspectors general -- one from the U.S. Postal Service and another from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management -- have issued conflicting reports over the obligations and how they should be handled. Finally, we found widespread agreement that the Postal Service's problems are greater than just the retirement rules. Here's what Donahoe, the postmaster general, told the PBS NewsHour on Sept. 6, 2011: "The problem is, when you start to look forward, even with the pre-funding money given back to us -- which there's not a lot of people coming forward telling us that they're going to give us that money -- the problem is, when you start to go forward, the volume and revenues continue to go down. We are losing first-class mail at the rate of 7.5 percent a year. That's not going to change." The postal unions themselves acknowledge in their press materials for the ad that changes to the retirement rules alone would not solve the Postal Service's financial problems. But changing the rules would buy time to come up with other ideas and solutions. "This cannot be done in the current panic mode, with congressional inaction forcing management to throw every possible cut against the wall to see what sticks, while anti-government ideologues exploit the situation," said the unions in a written statement. The postal unions' ad blames financial problems on "a 2006 law that drains $5 billion a year from post office revenue, while the Postal Service is forced to overpay billions more into federal accounts." The ad is right that the law did require payments of approximately that amount and that those payments have had a significant effect on the post office's bottom line. The additional overpayments are subject to debate. Even so, the law is hardly the only challenge the post office faces; it's also facing continuing declines in first-class mail. So we rate the ad's claim Half True.	None	Save America's Postal Service	None	None	None	2011-09-29T17:53:22	2011-09-29	['None']
pomt-11075	"I have always condemned … any of these white supremacists or bigots or anything like that."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/20/corey-stewart/corey-stewarts-history-far-right-explained/	A history with the fringe right has cast an early shadow over Republican Corey Stewart in his bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, despite efforts to deny past associations. In a fiery interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo on June 13, 2018, Stewart repeatedly denied that he had previously supported or accepted support from white supremacists and anti-Semites, calling Cuomo’s assertion a lie and an example of playing "the race card." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Stewart also hurled insults at both Kaine and Cuomo, telling the CNN host he should be fired for dishonesty and that Cuomo’s own late father was anti-Semitic. The exchange turned contentious when Cuomo asked about Stewart’s history with Paul Nehlen, a far-right conservative now making his second run for Congress in Wisconsin. "You have a well pronounced past of saying that you agree with and that you like people who push ugly, bigoted, intolerant and racist notions," Cuomo said, pointing to a fact sheet on Stewart’s relationship with Nehlen. "Hey, that’s a level of lie that’s just not true, Chris," Stewart responded. "Even for CNN, to go that far, that is not the case at all. I have always condemned … any of these white supremacists or bigots or anything like that. We want nothing to do with that." Stewart said he distanced himself from Nehlen after the far-right commentator began tweeting expressions of hatred toward Jews and Muslims, adding that "everybody supported Paul Nehlen" and that "back in the day he was not like that, at least as far as I knew." Cuomo said Nehlen had already sent anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim tweets in 2016, before Stewart first praised him. He also asked about Richard Hines, a prominent member of the neo-Confederate movement who endorsed Stewart during his campaign for governor in 2017. We decided to take a look at Stewart’s history with white supremacy and anti-Semitism and see how the claim that he has "always condemned" both checks out. Stewart and Paul Nehlen On Jan. 20, 2017, the night of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Stewart met with Nehlen at the Virginia Women for Trump ball. Stewart, who was running for governor at the time, called Nehlen "one of my personal heroes" and said he was "inspired" by him. Later that night, Stewart tweeted a photo with Nehlen, writing that he was "so honored" to receive his endorsement. Stewart has since deleted the post. Soon after, in February 2017, Nehlen wrote on Twitter that Islam was not a religion of peace and posted a photo of a plane striking the World Trade Center with the caption, "9/11 would’ve been a Wonderful #DayWithoutImmigrants." In the following months, Nehlen also tweeted that "Islam is not your friend," implied that Muslim no-go zones in Western countries should be bombed and retweeted posts saying Bill and Hillary Clinton were murdering associates. At the same time, he was tweeting out support for Stewart’s gubernatorial bid against Ed Gillespie, who eventually won the party’s nomination. Nehlen’s tweets escalated the next year. In January, he wrote on Twitter that most of his critics were Jewish, and in February, his account was banned after he targeted Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, with a racist tweet. (We accessed Nehlen’s tweets using a CNN archive). After Nick Freitas, Stewart’s primary opponent, helped resurface the video of Stewart and Nehlen on social media in June, Stewart disavowed the self-proclaimed "pro-white" candidate, telling the Washington Post he had praised Nehlen "before he went nuts and started spewing a bunch of stupid stuff" and tweeting, "Paul Nehlen has lost his marbles and needs serious help." But the condemnation was a long time coming, and Stewart was wrong to tell Cuomo he had separated himself from Nehlen as soon as he started "coming out with all those terrible things, those anti-Semitic things, those bigoted things." According to a June 2017 campaign finance filing with the Virginia Department of Elections, Stewart paid "Paul Nehlen Group" $759 as a "fundraising commission" in May 2017 — months after Nehlen had started posting problematic content to Twitter. Stewart spokesman Noel Fritsch told CNN the campaign had used the money to borrow Nehlen’s email list. And as Cuomo pointed out, Nehlen had retweeted anti-Muslim posts and tweets demanding that Twitter lift its ban on anti-Semite Ricky Vaughn’s account in 2016, before Stewart praised him at the inauguration-day ball. That same year, Nehlen also said he would be open to deporting all Muslims and monitoring all mosques, per The New York Times. Stewart and Jason Kessler Stewart received an endorsement for governor from Jason Kessler, organizer of the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in June 2017 after joining him at a February 2017 event sponsored by Unity and Security for America, Kessler’s organization. Kessler did not rise to prominence until the events at Charlottesville, but Stewart did cozy up to him in the months leading up to the rally. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com As with Nehlen, Stewart has distanced himself from Kessler. "Nobody knew who Kessler was back then," Stewart said, likely in reference to their February 2017 meeting, during a June 12, 2018, interview quoted in The New York Times. "Certainly I didn’t. I didn’t know he stood for all those horrible things. I want nothing to do with those things." Stewart and Richard Hines Richard Hines, a prominent member of the neo-Confederate movement who once called Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, South Carolina’s "Sikh-Hindu governor" and said a Richmond statue to black tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr. was offensive to his heritage, also endorsed Stewart’s gubernatorial campaign in a video posted to his Facebook page. In the video, Stewart addressed the crowd from in front of a wall-sized Confederate flag. We searched Google and Nexis and could not find any mention of Stewart disavowing Hines. Our ruling Stewart told Cuomo that he has "always condemned … any of these white supremacists or bigots or anything like that." Over the last several years, Stewart developed public relationships with Nehlen, Kessler and Hines. Although Stewart has distanced himself from Nehlen and Kessler during his campaign for the Senate, he has not always condemned their beliefs. It was only in the face of mounting public pressure that he spoke out against them, and even then it took him some time. We rate Stewart’s statement Mostly False. Clarification: This fact-check has been updated to more precisely refer to a previous Nehlen tweet. Our ruling remains the same. Correction: A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly said Stewart's donation to the Paul Nehlen Group occurred after Nehlen had been removed from Twitter. The donation occurred in May 2017, and Nehlen was removed in February 2018. Our ruling remains the same.

pomt-01752	Oregon’s "three largest employers, and 13 of the top 25, are health care providers."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/31/george-will/are-oregons-three-largest-employers-and-13-top-25-/	Syndicated newspaper columnist George Will weighed in recently on Oregon’s U.S. Senate race pitting incumbent Democrat Jeff Merkley against Republican challenger Monica Wehby. Will tossed a lot of numbers into his piece, including President Barack Obama’s approval rating in the state (43 percent), how many years Wehby has been a physician (17 out of her 52) and, curiously, how many X chromosomes the doctor has (2). The claim: Because the U.S. Senate has only three physicians, one of whom is retiring, Wehby’s knowledge of health care is sorely needed in that body, Will wrote. The same phenomenon is true in Oregon, he added, whose economy is dominated by large health care companies. The state’s "three largest employers, and 13 of the top 25, are health care providers," he wrote. PolitiFact Oregon checked those statistics. The analysis: We clicked the Internet link Will included in the column. It took us to a chart labeled, "State Profile: Largest Employers -- Oregon." The chart, according to information on the bottom of the page, was prepared by an Oklahoma-based company called Infogroup. The first part of Will’s claim asserted that Oregon’s three largest employers are health care providers, so we started there. The chart he relied on puts Doernbecher Children’s Hospital at the top with 14,000 employees. The second and third spots belong to Oregon Health & Science University (12,000) and "Cancer Center/OHSU Cancer" (10,000). We emailed Todd Murphy, OHSU’s senior communications specialist. The institution’s most recent monthly report, for June 2014, put total employment at 14,616, he wrote back. Importantly, he noted that Doernbecher and the Knight Cancer Institute "would be included in that number (both entities a fairly small portion of that 14,000)." So Will’s "top three" are just one employer -- and it’s not the state’s largest in any case. That distinction is usually given to chipmaker Intel, which the Infogroup chart lists at No. 5 with 6,300 employees. We emailed Chelsea Hossaini, Intel’s Northwest Region communications manager. "That claim is incorrect," she wrote of the chart. "Intel is Oregon’s largest private employer with 17,500." It should be noted that the chart Will highlighted included both public and private companies. Regardless, Intel far overshadows OHSU on total employment. Next, to check the second part of Will’s claim, we looked at some of the other "top 25" on the Infogroup chart to see if the listings were accurate. Many weren’t. The chart shows the University of Oregon at No. 11, for example, with 4,350 employees. However, the university’s information office wrote us that the correct figure, as of last fall, should be 5,105. The chart shows 4,000 employees at Lane Community College. But according to college spokeswoman Joan Aschim, LCC had only 1,128 contract employees as of Oct. 31. Numbers for other health care providers were also askew. Providence Portland Medical Center, at No. 18, has 3,408 employees, according to the chart. But Gary Walker, Providence Health & Service’s public affairs director, said that number gets close to employment at only one Providence facility in Oregon. Statewide, he said, the figure is closer to 18,500. (That figure puts Providence ahead of Intel, which calls itself the state’s largest private employer. However, Providence’s status as a nonprofit often puts the two companies on different lists.) St. Charles Health System in Bend has about 1,000 more employees than the 2,400 listed, hospital officials said. The 3,000 employees listed for Salem Hospital should be 3,949, said Mark Glyzewski, a hospital public relations consultant. Then there is Espresso PRN at No. 17, with 3,500 listed employees. In reality, Espresso PRN is a coffee shop with locations inside both of PeaceHealth’s Eugene-area hospitals, said Sonja Davis, the outfit’s general manager. It employs about two dozen, she said. The chart also lists 10,500 employees for PeaceHealth facilities in Oregon. The real number is 5,930, said Jim Godbold, a company spokesman. We talked to Jim Winner, vice president of Infogroup’s government section. "We obviously have some counts there that aren’t correct," Winner said. In instances such as the OHSU-Doernbecher-Knight Cancer Institute tallies, he added, "it looks like we double and tripled counted." He said he would send a note to his "data compilation folks" so they could revisit the statistics. Next we set out to find information on the true top 25 companies to glean how many are health care providers. As it turns out, no definitive list exists. Sometimes company sizes are tracked by revenue, sometimes by employment. Most lists track public or private employers, not both. Sometimes the state of Oregon is considered the top public employer; other times government jobs are listed by agency or not at all. The Oregon Business Journal has its own list of the top 25 companies, for example, but its scope is limited to privately held businesses in the Portland metro area. We emailed Nick Beleiciks, a state of Oregon employment economist, to see what figures he had. He sent us a list compiled in 2013 by Michael Meyers, the economist with Business Oregon, a state agency. The list has weaknesses: It doesn’t contain overall numbers for employment in Oregon by the state or federal governments, and it was drawn from several sources. In addition, on the lower end of the list, some Oregon businesses that should have been included, according to PolitiFact Oregon research, are absent. Still, the numbers it does have square with information available elsewhere, and it’s the most authoritative combined list of Oregon’s top public and private employers that we could find. Meyers’ top three businesses are Providence Health System (17,000), Intel (16,200) and Fred Meyer (14,000). Providence and Intel both say they have more employees than that now, and to be fair, the list is a year old. Still, those numbers are close to what our check found. Among Meyers’ top 25 are four health care providers, not the 13 Will cited. PolitiFact Oregon’s check of the Infogroup list found, once errors were eliminated, that nine of the 13 listed qualify. But big Oregon employers, such as Roseburg Forest Products, aren’t on the list. If they were, they would bump one or two of those out of the top 25. In the end, while we couldn’t compile a definitive list showing the number of health care providers among Oregon’s top 25 employers, our research did show that the Infogroup list is incorrect. Last, we emailed Will at his Washington, D.C., office to say we’d found significant errors in the chart he relied on for his Wehby column. "We do anticipate the running of an addendum in the near future to provide clarity about the employer information that was provided by Infogroup," came an unsigned reply from Will’s staff. The ruling: Will, in a column supporting the candidacy of Republican Senate candidate Monica Wehby, included a link purporting to show Oregon’s 25 largest employers. The chart, he wrote, indicated that the dominance of large health care providers in Oregon -- the three largest employers and 13 of the top 25 in the state fit that niche, according to the chart -- make Dr. Wehby the best choice for the job. Calls and emails to many of the companies listed, however, indicate that the chart’s numbers are way off, often wildly so. The top three employers on the list Will used are, in fact, a single entity. And by our count, the highest number of health care providers that can rank among Oregon’s top 25 employers is nine, not the 13 Will cited. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01109	"The difference over the (previous) four years between where things were headed and where we brought them to over the last four years is a total of $816 in saved property tax money."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-claims-credit-814-property-tax-saving/	In November 2013, Gov. Scott Walker earned the seventh of his eight Pants on Fire ratings by saying that because of actions taken during his first term, "the typical Wisconsin homeowner will save approximately $680" in property taxes over four years. We judged the statement to be not only inaccurate but ridiculous because the $680 wasn’t actual money saved. Rather, the figure was strictly based on a hypothetical scenario, which the governor didn’t disclose in making the claim. More than a year later, as his second term approached, Walker toured the state to tout his property tax relief measures. And he made a similar claim. "The difference over the last four years between where things were headed and where we brought them to over the last four years "is a total of $816 in saved property tax money," Walker said on Dec. 17, 2014, according to a La Crosse TV station. Though his wording may have been a bit hard to follow, the governor was claiming an even larger savings in property taxes. But he was more careful to say he was comparing his four years as governor to the previous four years. Let’s put that claim to the Truth-O-Meter. Median property tax bills Here are the annual property tax bills for a median-valued home, based on a statewide average tax rate, as estimated by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. We compared the change in the final four years of Democrat Jim Doyle’s term with the four years of Walker’s first term. Year Amount 2006 $2,733 2007 $2,836 2008 $2,856 2009 $2,919 2010 $2,963 Change during Doyle’s second term -- 2010 vs 2006 +$230 2011 $2,953 2012 $2,943 2013 $2,922 2014 $2,822 Change during Walker’s first term -- 2014 vs 2010 -$141 So, the median property tax bill increased in each of the final four years that Doyle was governor, and has decreased in each of the four years under Walker. But the total four-year savings under Walker is $141 -- not $816. To reach that figure, Walker again uses a hypothetical. Walker argues that had the median property tax bill continued to increase each year at the same pace it did under Doyle -- it would have been $69 larger in Walker’s first year, $140 larger in the second, $222 larger in the third and $385 in the fourth -- a total of $816 more, when the four years are combined. As a math problem, that works. But as we pointed out in rating Walker’s earlier property tax claim, he assumes that another governor, faced with the same state budget deficit he inherited, would have continued to allow local governments to raise property taxes at that 8 percent clip over an additional four years. Maybe that would have happened. And maybe not. Our rating Walker said: "The difference over the (previous) four years between where things were headed and where we brought them to over the last four years is a total of $816 in saved property tax money." But he is comparing real results -- property tax decreases during his four years as governor -- to hypothetical results -- how much higher property taxes would have been had they increased like they did during the previous four years under the previous governor. The property taxes on a median-value property "were headed" toward being $816 higher over four years -- if the pace of increases had continued. But that’s a big if. And the actual four-year savings under Walker is only $141. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-12845	Refugee "vetting was very haphazard," under the Obama Administration. "In many cases, we simply accepted the word of applicants."	mostly false	/california/statements/2017/feb/03/tom-mcclintock/americas-refugee-vetting-already-robust-not-haphaz/	Background checks on refugees seeking to enter the United States are among the most stringent in the world. California Congressman Tom McClintock recently claimed, however, those screenings were anything but strict under the Obama Administration. "The vetting was very haphazard," McClintock said in a Jan. 31, 2017, interview with Capital Public Radio. "In many cases, we simply accepted the word of applicants." McClintock is a Republican from the Sacramento area. In the interview, McClintock said he supports President Donald Trump’s immigration order, which temporarily bans all refugees from entering the country and indefinitely bars Syrian refugees. In addition to the refugee halt, Trump’s executive action also suspends immigration for citizens of seven majority Muslim countries for 90 days. They are: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. McClintock said Trump is rightly taking time to create a new vetting system because, as he put it, Obama’s was "very haphazard." Given the ongoing immigration debate, we decided to fact-check McClintock’s statement. Before we start, here’s some background on refugees: The federal government defines a refugee as any person outside of the U.S. that is of special humanitarian concern to the U.S. and "has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion," according to the Pew Research Center. Trump’s executive action affects many categories of immigrants from students to employees to refugees. Refugees, notably, have not been the primary perpetrators of any of the country’s major terror attacks that killed Americans in recent decades. Trump has said his order was necessary to ensure national security. Our research When asked about McClintock’s claim, Jennifer Cressy, a spokeswoman for the congressman said he was referring to testimony Congress received in 2015 from federal law enforcement that "the vetting process hinges on the word of the applicant due to lack of reliable documentary proof of identity." That testimony focused on Syrian refugees, which have accounted for a small but growing share of refugees admitted to the country. As our national partner PolitiFact has reported, there are undoubtedly challenges to vetting refugees. No system is foolproof. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress in October 2015 that the intelligence in Syria is "not as rich as we would like it to be," while FBI Director James Comey told Congress that there are "gaps" in data availability. The lack of U.S. relationships with Syrian government and law enforcement and the use of fake passports and fraudulent documents are also causes for concern, Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, told PolitiFact in November 2015. CIS advocates for limited immigration. There are examples of refugees accepted under Obama who joined, or attempted to join, terror networks in the Middle East after arriving in the United States. Cressy, McClintock’s spokeswoman, pointed to Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab, a refugee who after arriving in the U.S. traveled to Syria to fight for the Nusra Front, and then returned to settle in Sacramento. He is awaiting trial on terrorism charges. There are no examples, however, of any refugee committing fatal terror attacks on U.S. soil since the 1970s. More than three million refugees have arrived in the country since that time, making the odds of an American falling victim to a refugee in a terror attack miniscule, as PolitiFact California recently examined. McClintock’s claims about "very haphazard vetting" and that "we simply accepted the word of applicants" are overly broad and do not match up with how refugee screenings work. Refugee advocate responds Karen Ferguson is executive director of the Northern California International Rescue Committee, which helps resettle refugees in the United States. She responded to McClintock’s claim in an interview on Capital Public Radio’s Insight show early this month. "The idea that it would be haphazard is erroneous," Ferguson said. "The vetting system now takes anywhere from 16 to 36 months. It includes screenings from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, State Department, the National Counterterrorism Center, FBI, and the U.S. Intelligence Community." "There have always been multiple interviews, additional interviews," Ferguson added. "So, the vetting process is already there. And this statement that it’s been haphazard needs to be countered. It’s not true. And (refugee vetting) has been proven to be effective." For a fact-check in November 2015, PolitiFact spoke with experts and advocates who pushed back on the notion that the United States accepts refugees with no intelligence at all. In contrast to refugees worldwide, Syrians tend to have identity documents and the reasons they give for missing documents (i.e. a barrel bomb dropping on their house) can be verified, according to the State Department. Steps in vetting process The U.S. refugee admissions process has been in place since 1980 and was strengthened after 9/11. PolitiFact has outlined its many steps this way: Before refugees even face U.S. vetting, they must first clear an eligibility hurdle. The United Nations is the main authority that determines who counts as a refugee, who should be resettled (about 1 percent) and which countries would take them. This can take four to 10 months. Once the cases are referred to the United States, refugees are vetted through a process that involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Typically, about half of refugees are turned down, according to the State Department. Refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. For Syrian refugees, there’s one additional step. Their filings with the UN and initial documents submitted to the U.S. program are reviewed. Information about where they came from, what caused them to flee and what their experiences were like are cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information. McClintock’s claim about "haphazard vetting" comes as the U.S. grapples with how to ensure Syrian refugees are fully-vetted. Advocates for the stronger vetting, including the congressman, have described Syria as "a hot-bed for terrorism." Experts on this process, however, say the United States has successfully vetted refugees from similarly challenging countries in the past. "We’ve also resettled thousands in recent years from the Central African Republic, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all of which have faced similar terrorist threats and have unstable governments that present challenges for the vetting process. But we’ve done this successfully time and time again without incident," Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, told PolitiFact in 2015. Our ruling California Rep. Tom McClintock recently claimed refugee vetting was very haphazard," under the Obama Administration. "In many cases, we simply accepted the word of applicants." Federal law enforcement told Congress in 2015 that there are gaps in the available data for Syrian refugees, which represented a small but growing share of the refugees admitted to the United States under Obama. All sides in this debate acknowledge no vetting system is foolproof. McClintock’s claim about a "haphazard system," however, ignores the facts. The United Nations examines refugee applications and designates a small fraction as eligible. From there, refugees under consideration by the U.S. undergo a strict process that can last up to three years and involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. Of the more than 3 million refugees admitted to the country since 1980, none has carried out a fatal terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Advocates for the process say this is evidence the vetting works and is already robust. Given the challenges with Syrian refugee vetting, there’s an element of truth in McClintock’s statement. But his claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03128	"Soy ... el único official estatal quién es un hombre de negocios."	false	/texas/statements/2013/sep/16/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-not-sole-businessman-among-state-official/	As a businessman, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst claimed in an Aug. 19, 2013, interview, he knows how to keep Texas’ job growth going. "Soy un hombre de negocios, el único official estatal quién es un hombre de negocios," he said on the Houston Univision 45 show "Conexión Texas" – "I am a businessman, the only state official who is a businessman." Dewhurst, whose fluency in Spanish dates to his 1970-74 Central Intelligence Agency posting in Bolivia, phrased the same claim in a tighter way in another part of the interview, saying he is the only state elected official who is a businessman: "Yo soy el único hombre de negocios eligido estatal." Currently running to keep his job as lieutenant governor, a post he’s held since 2003, Dewhurst makes a similar statement on his campaign website, saying he’s "the only businessman elected to statewide office." D magazine quoted Dewhurst in a June 23, 2011, blog post, as saying, "Out of 29 elected state officials, I’m the only traditional businessman." Dewhurst built a multimillion-dollar fortune as an energy entrepreneur and investor in Houston after his service in the Air Force and CIA. According to Spanish-English dictionaries and consultation with our colleagues at the Austin American-Statesman’s weekly Spanish newspaper, ¡Ahora Sí!, the adjective "estatal" would translate simply as "state." By email, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine told us that a June 29, 2013, quotation in a Dallas Morning News news blog post represented what Dewhurst "typically says in English": "I’m the only traditional businessperson elected statewide." In the "Conexión" interview, Considine told us, Dewhurst was referring to Gov. Rick Perry, Attorney General Greg Abbott, Comptroller Susan Combs, Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, whose occupations Considine said were, respectively, rancher, lawyer, rancher, retired military and rancher. The Texas secretary of state’s office lists 27 statewide elected positions, and the Texas Legislature has 31 senators and 150 representatives, who are members of state government and make state law even though they are elected from regions rather than statewide. We pulled together information on Texas officials’ occupations from news stories, biographies on state websites and interviews with officeholders’ aides. A full list of sources is at right. Texas’ top statewide offices Among the five executive statewide elected officials Considine named, Staples describes himself as a "former rancher and businessman" on his campaign website. Staples, retired Marine Lt. Col. Patterson and state Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, a radio host and station owner, are each challenging Dewhurst for the 2014 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. Staples’ campaign manager, Cody McGregor, told us by phone that Staples started and owned a real estate firm from 1986 until 2007, was part owner of a plant nursery and started and ran a cattle-raising operation. Before entering public service, Perry farmed cotton and wheat, raised cattle and served in the Air Force, according to news stories from the Austin American-Statesman archives and NPR. Spokespeople told us by email that Abbott is a lawyer and Combs was a lawyer and rancher. All statewide offices in Texas Among the 27 state officials elected statewide, we spotted an accountant and an investment banker. That group includes the officials above plus the Texas Railroad Commission’s three members, the Texas Supreme Court’s nine justices and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals’ nine judges. Members of those courts are lawyers and judges, as required by state law -- specifically, each must have 10 years’ experience as a practicing lawyer or judge. Railroad Commission chairman Barry Smitherman, a candidate for attorney general, was an investment banker and briefly a prosecutor in the Harris County District Attorney’s office, according to a June 26, 2013, Texas Tribune news story. His colleagues are Christi Craddick, described in her biographical entry on the commission’s website and Statesman stories as an oil and gas lawyer and former advisor to her father, then-House Speaker Tom Craddick; and David Porter, an accountant whose biographical entry says he "built a successful small business around his CPA practice." Adding in Texas’ two U.S. senators, federal officials elected statewide, would bump the number up to 29, matching Dewhurst’s 2011 statement. Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz are lawyers. State legislators The Senate’s official guide to senators and the House Chief Clerk’s Office list of representatives’ biographical data give business as an occupation for dozens of members of the current (83rd) Legislature. Others are listed more specifically as owning companies, restaurants, agencies or firms. Here, too, "lawyer" is a common occupation, but there are also engineers, contractors, educators, insurance agents, ranchers and doctors. Our ruling Dewhurst said he’s "el único official estatal quién es un hombre de negocios," which his camp would translate as "the only statewide elected official who is a businessman." This claim falls down without going beyond the five executive offices that his spokesman said Dewhurst was referring to. Past that, the claim is incorrect in a commonsensical way, if one accepts, as we do, that legislators are elected state officials as well. Dozens of legislators are in business. Dewhurst isn’t "único" in this regard. We rate his statement as False. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-04641	Says Rush Limbaugh made it clear he’d rather see the country fail than President Barack Obama succeed.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/sep/13/mark-strama/mark-strama-says-rush-limbaugh-made-it-clear-hed-r/	Texas state Rep. Mark Strama brought up conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh while speaking over breakfast to Texas delegates at the Democratic National Convention, the Austin American-Statesman noted in a Sept. 5, 2012, news blog post. Strama, D-Austin, said Barack Obama’s success in turning out new voters in 2008 led to Republican operatives dedicating themselves to making sure that never recurs. "That’s why you have Rush Limbaugh making it clear he would rather see the country fail than this president succeed," Strama said. A reader suggested that Strama mangled Limbaugh’s statement. We decided to check. Given that Limbaugh is a conservative radio personality, it’s not surprising he would dart Obama. And he has repeatedly said he hopes Obama fails as president, though he also has indicated there were ways for Obama to succeed. Limbaugh’s original comment along these lines aired shortly before the Democrat’s January 2009 inauguration. During the Jan. 16, 2009, episode of his program, Limbaugh noted that other "people on our side of the aisle" had expressed hopes that Obama succeed. In contrast, Limbaugh said, "I've been listening to Barack Obama for a year and a half. I know what his politics are. I know what his plans are, as he has stated them. I don't want them to succeed. If I wanted Obama to succeed, I'd be happy the Republicans have laid down. And I would be encouraging Republicans to lay down and support him. "Look, what he's talking about is the absorption of as much of the private sector by the U.S. government as possible, from the banking business, to the mortgage industry, the automobile business, to health care. I do not want the government in charge of all of these things. I don't want this to work." Limbaugh then said that in response to a request that he write about his hopes for Obama, he was thinking of replying: "I hope he fails," words he repeated later in the segment after talking about how liberals treated Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush. "Were the liberals out there hoping Bush succeeded or were they out there trying to destroy him before he was even inaugurated? Why do we have to play the game by their rules? Why do we have to accept the premise here that because of the historical nature of his presidency, that we want him to succeed?" Limbaugh said. Web searches led us to additional instances of Limbaugh saying he hoped Obama -- and his policies -- would fail. For a Fox News program aired Jan. 21, 2009, Limbaugh was asked by commentator Sean Hannity if he wanted Obama to succeed. Limbaugh replied that while he was hearing many Republicans say so, he had suspicions about Obama’s plans. Limbaugh: "Now if he turns out to be a Reagan, if he adds Reagan to his recipe of FDR and Lincoln, and if he does cut some taxes," references to Ronald Reagan, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. Hannity: "Yes." Limbaugh: "If he does not eliminate the Bush tax cuts, I would call that success. So yes, I would hope he would succeed if he acts like Reagan, but if he's going to do FDR, if he's going to do the new New Deal all over, which we will call here the Raw Deal, why would I want him to succeed?" Limbaugh then said that if Obama was going to implement a "far-left" agenda -- including "nationalized" health care -- that would be the "end of America as we have known it because that's then going to set the stage for everything being government owned, operated or provided. Why would I want that to succeed? I don't believe in that. I know that's not how this country is going to be great in the future, it's not what made this country great. "So I shamelessly say, no, I want him to fail, if his agenda is a far-left collectivism, some people say socialism, as a conservative heartfelt, deeply, why would I want socialism to succeed?" Limbaugh revisited his hope that Obama fail in a Feb. 13, 2009, segment of his program about the Democratic-steered economic stimulus plan; a February 2009 appearance before the Conservative Political Action Conference; a May 10, 2011, segment focused on Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels; and a June 4, 2012, segment in which he suggested a critical listener was distorting his original point. Limbaugh said at the CPAC meeting: "What is so strange about being honest about saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation? Why would I want that to succeed?" Nowhere did we find an instance of Limbaugh saying he’d rather see the country fail than the president succeed. By email and in a telephone interview, Strama told us he deliberately has not said that Limbaugh used those precise words. But the conclusion that Limbaugh wanted the country to fail is self-evident, Strama said, especially because Limbaugh initially piped up before Obama had even been sworn in at a time the economy was in freefall. Saying that this analysis is his inference, Strama said: "If you get 100 people who share my view of politics, they would all agree with me." By email, Strama said: "Limbaugh's remarks must be judged in this context. It is one thing to disagree with the president's policies. It is another thing altogether to root for the failure of those policies -- with all the associated misery that such failure would cause -- so that your party can win an election that is four years away. If a Democrat had hoped Bush's Iraq policy failed, with the consequences such failure would hold for our troops, it would be reprehensible, almost treasonous. Given the economic conditions in January 2009, hoping for the failure of the American government's policies at that time was also reprehensible and almost treasonous." More broadly, Strama wrote, unless "you believe that policy has no consequence to the well-being of our people and our country, it is logically impossible to hope a president's policies fail while hoping the best for our country." In a follow-up email, Strama said it is possible to oppose a policy and still wish the country to succeed, but Limbaugh’s focus on Obama failing so Republicans could recapture power -- at the expense of national difficulties -- crosses a line. We emailed Limbaugh and did not hear back. Our ruling Strama said Limbaugh made it clear he’d rather see the country fail than Obama succeed. Limbaugh has been clear about hoping Obama and his policies fail. Far as we can tell, though, he has not said he would prefer that the country fails, though Strama openly infers as much. Our sense is this statement contains an element of truth, but it's otherwise speculative. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Mark Strama	None	None	None	2012-09-13T11:46:02	2012-09-05	['None']
pomt-07673	Says Rick Scott's proposed budget "would lay off 20,000 teachers."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/09/rod-smith/democratic-party-chairman-rod-smith-says-rick-scot/	In his first State of the State address, Florida Gov. Rick Scott boldly told legislators that he has created the "most fiscally conservative state budget in the country." "Our jobs budget is targeted to create private-sector jobs, increase accountability and reduce the size of government," Scott told a joint session of the Legislature on March 8, 2011. Moments after Scott finished his 27-minute address, Florida Democratic Party Chairman Rod Smith offered a dramatically different interpretation of Scott's spending plan. "Since he took office, Floridians have seen that Rick Scott only cares about imposing his rigid and extreme philosophy on our state, rather than working to implement common-sense solutions for Florida," Smith said in a statement. "Whether he is killing high-speed rail, proposing his spending plan that would lay off 20,000 teachers, or putting communities at risk by ending critical law enforcement tools to stop pill-mills, Rick Scott's agenda is doing real harm to our state." The thing that jumped out at us in Smith's claim is that Scott's budget "would lay off 20,000 teachers" -- a huge amount. We'll explain how huge in a minute. Budget cuts don't spare education To balance the state budget as required in the Constitution, lawmakers must trim at least $3.62 billion from this year's $70.5 billion budget. Scott's proposal goes further -- reducing the budget by $4.6 billion to $65.9 billion. PreK-12 education funding is hardly spared as part of Scott's proposed cuts. Scott's budget proposal for 2011-12 reduces the total amount of state PreK-12 education funding from $18.2 billion, to $16.5 billion -- a total cut of about $1.7 billion. That number includes local property taxes the state mandates school boards collect (the required local effort), the state contribution from sales tax revenues and trust funds, and federal dollars passed through the state. The cuts break down this way (we're rounding a bit, so everything might not add up exactly): • The state's contribution would remain the same at about $8.9 billion. • Required local education taxes would shrink by about $660 million, and discretionary local taxes would shrink an additional $200 million -- shrinking the local contribution from about $8.4 billion to nearly $7.5 billion. • And the state also would not replace about $873 million in federal stimulus funds. In total, Scott's budget proposals would reduce the amount of per-student funding by 10.19 percent, from about $6,900 per student to nearly $6,200 per student. (Some of that reduction could be offset for one year, Scott says, by requiring teachers to pay 5 percent of their salary toward their retirement and by using temporary federal funds given to school districts in 2010.) Scott budget chief Jerry McDaniel has told lawmakers that the proposed budget would result in some teacher layoffs, though he did not offer a hard estimate. The budget document itself -- while cutting funding -- also does not explicitly say school districts should lay off 20,000 teachers. So we turned to Smith's spokesman, Eric Jotkoff, to understand where the figure came from. Basis of Smith's 20,000 teacher-layoff claim Jotkoff said the figure originated from an article that appeared in the Gainesville Sun on Feb. 21, 2011, aptly titled "Worst-case scenario for education is 20,000 layoffs in Florida." The article itself doesn't cite the origin of the 20,000-teacher layoff number; rather, it details Scott's proposed cuts, including a nearly 10 percent reduction in per-pupil education spending. "While promising to create a world-class education system, Gov. Rick Scott has simultaneously proposed the deepest cuts for Florida public schools by any governor in recent history," the article states. "In a worst-case scenario, they would lead to more than 20,000 layoffs of teachers and other personnel in the state's 67 school districts." The article does acknowledge that Scott's complementary proposal to make teachers contribute to their retirement could free up local school district dollars to offset some of the proposed education funding cuts. Jotkoff referenced numbers presented in the article to help make his case. • $1.75 billion -- the total of PreK-12 education funding cuts (we say $1.7 billion because of the way we rounded the numbers). • 80 percent -- the percentage of education funds that the article says goes to personnel costs (we're not stating that number as fact and the Sun article didn't cite a source). • $46,708 -- the average salary of a Florida teacher (a figure generated by the National Education Association). Jotkoff said that if 80 percent of education spending is for personnel costs, that represents $1.4 billion of the overall proposed cuts. Divide those cuts by the average salary of a teacher and that equates to the salaries of 29,973 teachers -- even more than cited in the Sun article. We found two issues with that calculation, however. First, the salary figure does not include teacher benefits. Second, while Education Week has reported that about 80 percent of school districts' budgets are personnel costs, that is a broad estimate that could vary depending on the school district, and also includes school district employees who are not teachers. On top of that, there's a much simpler way to measure the impact of Scott's proposed cuts on teachers. The Florida Department of Education said that at the start of the 2010 school year, school districts employed 169,540 teachers and 22,924 additional workers classified as instructional staff, a group that includes guidance counselors, school social workers, librarians. That's 192,464 people classified as "instructional staff." Using that number, Scott's 10.19 percent per-pupil funding cut would be the equivalent cut of 19,612 teachers and instructional staff. That's pretty close to the 20,000 teachers Smith is claiming would be fired under Scott's budget. But you need to read the fine print. More than just the numbers As we've already said, Scott's budget cuts funding, not teachers. Specific cuts would be left to individual school districts. But there are also two impediments to the large-scale teacher cuts Smith is warning of. The first is rooted in the state Constitution. In November 2002, Florida's voters approved an amendment to the Constitution that sets limits for the maximum number of students in a classroom starting with the 2010-11 school year. The Legislature tried to loosen the restriction through a second constitutional amendment in 2010, but the amendment failed to receive the needed 60 percent of voter approval. Since 2003, the state has spent about $16 billion to implement the amendment, mainly by hiring some 30,000 additional teachers. It would be virtually impossible to cut 20,000 teacher jobs and still comply with the constitutional mandate. Second, Scott proposes making school district employees contribute 5 percent of their salary toward their retirement. He says employee contributions would free up local school district funding to brace against some of the other education cuts. If that proposal were to pass, school districts would effectively see a per-pupil funding cut of about $505, Scott says, a 7.36 percent reduction. That would be the equivalent of 14,165 teachers and instructional staff. But again, that doesn't mean that will be how many get laid off if Scott's education plan passes. Our ruling In offering a counter to Scott's budget message of fiscal restraint, Smith says Scott wants to recklessly lay off 20,000 teachers. Scott is proposing major cuts to education funding. And even Scott's budget chief acknowledges layoffs will occur. But trying to estimate a number is tricky. Yes, you can divide the number of teachers and instructional staff by proposed per-pupil cuts to reach a figure, but that ignores the Florida Constitution, which requires small class sizes, and local school district decisions, in how they will spend their money. Also, Scott's proposal to make school district employees contribute to their retirement could dilute some of the cuts being pushed by Scott. That said, Scott's budget plan would strip a significant chunk of funding out of school districts, equivalent to the amount of around 20,000 teachers. Balancing it all, we rate Smith's claim Half True.	None	Rod Smith	None	None	None	2011-03-09T17:29:30	2011-03-08	['None']
pomt-09817	"We waterboard, incidentally, hundreds of our own military personnel. They waterboard themselves in training to toughen themselves up."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/04/duncan-hunter/duncan-hunter-says-we-have-waterboarded-our-own-mi/	In a discussion on MSNBC's Hardball program about whether the government ought to consider prosecuting people involved in enhanced interrogation techniques used on some terror suspects, former U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California, argued that the issue really comes down to waterboarding. "And," he said, "waterboarding is not torture." In fact, said Hunter, a Vietnam veteran and former candidate for president, "We waterboard, incidentally, hundreds of our own military personnel. They waterboard themselves in training to toughen themselves up." He added, "The Geneva Convention .. .was analyzed by the lawyers in place, and they came to the conclusion, especially about waterboarding, because that's the primary thing, that, since we do it to our own soldiers, by the hundreds, incidentally, and it doesn't hurt them, and they — and it makes them tougher, and it doesn't hurt anybody — Khalid Sheikh Mohammed gained weight after he was waterboarded — we decided that, since we do that to our own soldiers in training... we‘re not going to consider that torture. " Hunter later challenged host Chris Matthews saying, "But the point is, if we do it, are we torturing American soldiers? You have to answer yes if you consider waterboarding to be torture." Matthews said the difference is that U.S. service people know they are in training. They know they aren't going to be killed. "That captured person who is one of our enemies has no idea what we‘re doing when we submit him to water torture." Said Hunter: "If we use it with our own soldiers in training, as we do waterboarding, then it should be allowed with people who have killed thousands of Americans." We decided to examine Hunter's claim about waterboarding our service personnel as part of their training and found that he is right. U.S. special operations troops have, in the past, sometimes used a form of waterboarding as part of survival exercises, called Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training. The idea is to prepare them in the event they are ever captured and interrogated with such means. According to reports in the New York Times and Vanity Fair, the CIA adopted some of the interrogation techniques used on terror suspects from that SERE training, including the use of waterboarding. According to the Vanity Fair story, three-week SERE training for the U.S. soldiers included waterboarding, forced nudity, extreme temperatures, sexual and religious ridicule, agonizing stress positions, and starvation-level rations. The story quotes Michael Rolince, former section chief of the FBI's International Terrorism Operations: "You're not going to die, but you think you are." But while the techniques may have been derived from SERE training, a different, more intense brand of waterboarding was used on terror suspects, according to recently released CIA documents. According to a May 7, 2004, CIA Inspector General special report on interrogation techniques used on terror suspects, which has some parts redacted, "OIG’s (Office of the Inspector General's) review of the videotapes revealed that the waterboard technique employed at (redacted) was different from the technique as described in the DoJ (Department of Justice) opinion and used in the SERE training. The difference was in the manner in which the detainee’s breathing was obstructed. At the SERE School and in the DoJ opinion, the subject’s airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passages; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contest, the Agency interrogator (redacted) continuously applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee’s mouth and nose. One of the psychologists/interrogators acknowledged that the Agency’s use of the technique differed from that used in SERE training and explained that the Agency’s technique is different because it is 'for real' and is more poignant and convincing." The report also says the CIA's Office of Medical Services has characterized the SERE waterboarding as "so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant." The office said its frequency and intensity raised questions about whether it was effective or medically safe. So we think Hunter misleads a bit by equating waterboarding in training of military personnel with the technique used on terror suspects. According to the CIA inspector general's report, the technique used on the suspects was more powerful and convincing. And in the case of one terror suspect, it was used 183 times, often in rapid succession. So to argue the technique isn't torture because it is used on American servicemen as part of training ignores that it was not used in the same way. Still, Hunter is correct that the U.S. military has waterboarded servicemen as part of survival training. And so we rule his statement Mostly True.

pomt-07230	The city’s 30 percent set aside for affordable housing in urban renewal areas is calculated citywide -- not district by district	false	/oregon/statements/2011/jun/02/sam-adams/portland-mayor-sam-adams-says-affordable-housing-c/	A recent proposal to spend some $20 million to renovate the Memorial Coliseum would, according to the Portland Development Commission, draw private investment to Portland’s Rose Quarter. It would also drive down the amount of money being spent on affordable housing in the Oregon Convention Center urban renewal district, which includes the Coliseum, to 16 percent -- 10 percentage points short of the city’s previously planned 26 percent. It’s that last bit that got some attention in a recent article in The Oregonian, which asserted that the Coliseum upgrades "would be funded by sidestepping Portland policy that a certain percent of urban renewal money be spent on affordable housing within specific districts." The same day the newspaper published the article, Mayor Sam Adams, who had included the Coliseum upgrades in his latest spending plan, pushed back. "I raise this as we get into the general discussion because I think there's been some recent news coverage that would lead one to believe that the requirement was 30 percent in all districts," Adams said during a council meeting that night. "It's a 30 percent citywide average. We specifically debated at that time the differences between the two. We knew that some districts would be more conducive, better cost benefit for subsidizing affordable housing expenditures, and others would be less." So is Adams right? PolitiFact Oregon delved into the historical record to find out. The concept of setting aside a certain amount for affordable housing stretches back to a resolution passed by the Portland City Council on April 20, 2006. Back then, Adams -- along with three other council members, including the mayor at the time -- voted to pass Resolution No. 36403. That resolution, in part, committed the council to establishing "a policy to dedicate a percentage of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) revenues from all Urban Renewal Districts citywide to an affordable housing set aside fund." The resolution, however, didn’t specify what the policy should look like. It didn’t even specify the 30 percent figure. For those details, we need to fast-forward a few months to October 2006. We also need to introduce another player in all of this: the Portland Development Commission. At the time all of this was being hashed out, the PDC set its own budget and was the final word in development issues. These days, the agency looks to the City Council for its budget, though it still maintains a certain amount of independence. Anyhow, on Oct. 16, 2006, the PDC approved Resolution No. 6398 titled "Adopting a tax increment financing for affordable housing policy and implementation plan to the City Council." Appended to the resolution was an action plan for designing just such a policy. And in that action plan was this: "policy will establish a requirement that a minimum of 30 percent of all tax increment resources averaged across all URA (urban renewal areas) …. be spent on Affordable Housing." Now, that bit only applied to "new districts," not the Convention Center. The policy addressed the Convention Center area specifically, stating "PDC will establish policy for the Oregon Convention Center Urban Renewal Area to spend a minimum of 26 percent … on Affordable Housing." In any case, the big takeaway here is the phrase "averaged across all URA," which would seem to back up Adams. If only things had ended there. While the Development Commission was doing its thing, on Oct, 25, 2006, the Portland City Council passed its own related ordinance that stated: "It is the policy of the City of Portland that 30 percent of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) over the life of an Urban Renewal District shall be dedicated to the development, preservation and rehabilitation of housing affordable to households …" That wording passed with yeas from all five council members -- including Adams. Now, that ordinance isn’t super clear as to whether the policy was on a per-district basis or whether it was averaged. Thankfully, there’s some evidence to help us interpret the intent of the council at the time. At the council meeting, then-Commissioner Erik Sten seemed to be under the impression that the City Council wanted a per-district commitment while the Development Commission had legislated a general 30 percent commitment. He wanted the two reconciled. The same day, the Portland Development Commission amended its plan. The revised plan said: "Policy will establish a requirement that a minimum of 30 percent of all tax increment resources in each URA … be spent on Affordable Housing." Again, the plan put a 26 percent goal on the Convention Center separately. See that? "In each URA …" About a year later, the Portland City Council took this plan and added it to its own ordinance calling it "binding" city policy. That seemed like a closed case to us. But we called Adams’ office to see if we were missing anything. Here’s what Amy Ruiz, the mayor’s spokeswoman, had to say on the issue: "We have a trio of City documents that all set city policy, and that all have slightly different wording on this topic, which makes it useful to look at the overall legislative history, including the council discussion when these votes were taken. Our city attorney's office did this, and notes that there is ‘clear legislative history to support the conclusion that the 30% policy was meant to apply citywide, and there were statements by Commissioner Sten opposite that.’ "Ultimately, as noted by the city attorney's office, these are all council policies. They are not state statutes. Where there's any ambiguity, it's up to the council to clarify if they want to. City policy is subject to change at any time by the council, while a state statute, as you know, is not." We asked her for a little more of the legislative history she mentioned given that the history we’d seen seemed to indicate the council was deliberate in asking for the "in each URA" language. Ruiz referred back to the Oct. 18, 2006, meeting of the Portland City Council, specifically to the following remarks by PDC Chairman Mark Rosenbaum: "In an unexpected circumstance, which we're not budgeted for at this point, in order to be true to our commitment of 30%, we would say, well [if we] didn't spend it in Lents, we'd have the opportunity to make up for it in the other four areas so we were consistent with our commitment. … We made it very clear that it is our policy to spend 30% in each district and only under an extreme circumstance would we vary and then if we did, we would be forced to make up for it elsewhere." If anything, though, that seemed to us to contradict the mayor’s statement that the policy was 30 percent averaged across the city. It does allow for that as a bare minimum in case of extenuating circumstances, but as far as we can tell, that doesn’t mean Adams was right when he said "it’s a 30 percent citywide average." The evidence at the time seems to clearly indicate that the goal and the aspiration of both the City Council and the Development Commission was to set aside 30 percent in each district and 26 percent specifically in the Coliseum area. It’s also clear that the city officials knew there could be certain cases when that might be easier said than done and, as a result, gave themselves the cushion of 30 percent averaged across all districts. But that cushion was not the rule -- it was the exception. The PDC chairman’s statement sums it up: We'll try for 30 in each and if we absolutely can't, then we'll make it up elsewhere. Adams, however, is asserting the the rule was always a 30 percent average. It’s within his right to go that direction, but it seems off-base to claim now that his rule was the rule along. The city attorney's office can tell him that what he wants to do is legal, but that's not the same as the historical intent. We’ll rate this one False. Comment on this item.

pomt-10506	"I remember landing under sniper fire."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/25/hillary-clinton/video-shows-tarmac-welcome-no-snipers/	(Published March 25, 2008) During an introduction to a foreign policy speech on Iraq on March 17, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, she made in March 1996. "I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base." But that's not what happened, as demonstrated by CBS News video that shows Clinton arriving on the tarmac under no visible duress, and greeting a child who offers her a copy of a poem. The Washington Post Factchecker also turned a skeptical eye on Clinton's comments, reporting that a review of more than 100 news stories from the time documented no security threats to the First Lady. CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, who covered Clinton on the Bosnia visit, wrote of her memories of the trip : "To be sure, it was not the 'safest' trip for a first lady to take: there were serious risks in traveling to Bosnia, even for the president's wife under the vigilant protection of the U.S. military. It took some guts for her to go. But I don't recall, and did not note, any close calls on this trip with sniper fire or any other dangers. " Immediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. "There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened," she said. But she retracted the remarks a week later, telling the Philadelphia Daily News editorial board on March 24, 2008, that she "misspoke," correcting herself to say she had been told there was a threat of sniper fire in the area. The next day she told reporters, "So I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I'm human, which for some people is a revelation." On the campaign trail, Clinton has discussed the danger of the trip before and how it gave her important foreign policy experience. The Des Moines Register reported her saying on Dec. 30, 2007, "We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac there." Interestingly, Clinton's memoir Living History depicts an arrival that, though dangerous, included neither actual sniper fire nor running. It matches the CBS footage and appears to contradict Clinton's later retelling: "Security conditions were constantly changing in the former Yugoslavia, and they had recently deteriorated again. Due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip, we were forced to cut short an event on the tarmac with local children, though we did have time to meet them and their teachers and to learn how hard they had worked during the war to continue classes in any safe spot they could find. One eight-year-old girl gave me a copy of a poem she had written entitled 'Peace.'" We have questioned Clinton's previous remarks about her foreign policy experience. We found her statements that she helped bring peace to Northern Ireland and that she stood up to the Chinese government on women's rights to be Half True. We found her statement that she negotiated open borders for Kosovars to be Barely True. There's no doubt flying into Bosnia was dangerous back in 1996, but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire, and hustling off the tarmac is not the same as running with your head down. Yes, Clinton later acknowledged that she was mistaken, but it's hard to understand how she could err on something so significant as whether she did or didn't dodge sniper bullets. Quite simply, this kind of hyperbole deserves our harshest assessment. We rule Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/01fc6c19-18f2-4a90-8ed3-d4fdc2b7fe48	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-03-25T00:00:00	2008-03-17	['None']
pomt-00676	"On my last trip to New Hampshire, I think I met the guy who founded the first and only bank since Dodd-Frank passed, since the financial crisis. One bank in the country."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/may/08/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-he-met-nh-man-who-founded-only-us-ba/	At an appearance in Concord in mid-April, former Florida governor Jeb Bush talked banking -- and the legislation meant to reform it. "On my last trip to New Hampshire I think I met the guy who founded the first and only bank since Dodd-Frank passed, since the financial crisis," Bush said at his speech at Saint Anselm College’s Politics and Eggs event April 17. "One bank in the country." The banking reform legislation known as Dodd-Frank became law on July 21, 2010, nearly five years ago. We decided to look into Bush’s statement that only one bank had been founded since that time. We checked with Bush’s camp and according to spokesman Matt Gorman, Bush met with businessman Bill Grenier when he was in the state March 14. Greiner, of Bedford, filed last year with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to charter an entirely new bank named Primary Bank. "We’re going against the grain, and we’re okay with that because we see a need," he told the Wall Street Journal in December. So would Primary Bank be the nation’s "first and only" since Dodd-Frank? Not exactly. Depending on the data set you choose, it’s either the second, fourth, ninth or 20th. The Journal and other media sources have said the first bank founded after the law’s passage is in fact the Bank of Bird-in-Hand, Pa. It mainly serves the area’s Amish community. And yes, it includes a drive-through window for horse-and-buggy. This was included in the information forwarded to us by Bush’s spokesman. But we decided to ask the FDIC itself. Greg Hernandez, an agency spokesman, offered further details. First, off, when Bush and others talk about new banks, they’re referring to de novo banks, or banks issued a new charter by the agency. Not counting Grenier’s startup, the FDIC actually lists three banks issued charters since 2010. The oldest, Lakeside Bank of Lake Charles, La., had its charter approved in October 2009, before Dodd-Frank’s passage. But the charter wasn’t consummated until late July 2010, after the bill was signed into law. The next bank on the FDIC’s list is Start Community Bank of New Haven, Conn. While its charter was approved in December 2010, the bank itself says its origins date to 2004, with the founding of its parent company. The Bird-in-Hand bank’s charter was both approved and consummated in November 2013. It seems fair to call Primary Bank the second of all-new bank approved by the FDIC since Dodd Frank’s passage. But if you include the two others that the agency itself lists, Primary Bank would come in fourth. The FDIC lists five other banks as having been established since mid-2010, including one in Kansas City, Mo.; Brockton, Mass,; and Easley, S.C., according to Hernandez. These banks, however, didn’t apply for new charters. "Other banks can be established through a shelf charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency," Hernandez wrote in an e-mail. "That would be when a private equity group purchases a failed bank. Also, (newly) established banks can be the result of a merger or acquisition." If you use that criteria, and include the five other banks mentioned, Primary Bank would be the ninth bank started after Dodd-Frank. And finally, while they’re not called banks and are regulated by a different agency, consumers generally see credit unions as the equivalent of banks (and credit unions are affected by the law, too). According to John Fairbanks of the National Credit Union Administration, there have been at least 11 credit union charters approved since the start of 2011. That would make Primary Bank at least the 14th and at most the 20th such institution started since Dodd Frank overhauled the banking industry. None of these different contexts would make Grenier’s bank the first one established since the passage of Dodd-Frank. And there’s the implication that new banks aren’t being created because of Dodd-Frank, which raises the question: What does the law actually do, and why is it important? The full name of the law is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and it passed on July 15, 2010. President Obama signed it into law on July 21. While the financial crisis mentioned by Bush predated the law by a couple of years, Dodd-Frank itself has been fiercely criticized by Republicans, who say it stifles growth in the financial sector. The law itself was meant to prevent another financial meltdown like that of 2008-9. According to an overview from CNBC, the law was meant to avoid banks becoming "too big to fail," regulate risky trading and created new oversight bodies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The banking industry blames the law, in part, for the lack of new banks. Frank Keating, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, criticized government regulations on the financial sector in a recent column for The Hill. After mentioning the New Hampshire bank, he gets down to business. "Investors are reluctant to shoulder the cumulative regulatory burdens -- both from new laws and from a more stringent approach by regulators themselves -- and the rising legal risks associated with running a bank these days." Keating doesn’t mention Dodd-Frank by name, but the implication is clear. He also highlights the dropoff of bank creation post-2010, pointing out that "the average from 2002 to 2008 was closer to 100" per year. According to a Motley Fool explainer piece, "between 1990 and 2006, the FDIC approved an average of 152 bank and thrift charters a year." That being said, there isn’t universal agreement that regulation is behind the drop in new bank creation. Keating acknowledges that in his column, noting toward the end that "the low interest rate environment is challenging for bank startups. And the number of banks has been steadily falling for decades due to a wave of mergers and acquisitions." According to a report from the Richmond Federal Reserve bank, there could be several factors at work. One is the Federal Reserve’s policy of keeping interest rates low. That lowers interest rates overall, making it harder for banks to earn money. (The Motley Fool suggests that’s the main reason for the drop.) The research raises the possibility that the cost of complying with regulations has gone up, but says "it is unclear" whether that is driving down the creation of new banks. Finally, though, it mentions that the FDIC itself has changed its policies for new banks, in a move that predates the passage of Dodd-Frank. "In 2009 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation increased the length of time -- from three to seven years -- during which newly insured depository institutions are subject to higher capital requirements and more frequent examinations," the paper’s authors write. Our ruling Former Florida governor Jeb Bush said "I met the guy who founded the first and only bank since Dodd-Frank passed, since the financial crisis. One bank in the country." He’s certainly got a point that there has been a sharp dropoff of newly chartered banks since Dodd-Frank became law in the summer of 2010, but it’s incorrect to say Primary Bank would be the first in the country. There is at least one other in the nation, and possibly several more. It is certainly the first bank chartered in New Hampshire during that time. The suggestion that Dodd-Frank has caused the drop-off in new bank formation is also debatable. While regulation has perhaps played a role, FDIC policies set before the law’s passage may have had a more direct effect. And the overall economic picture, with incredibly low interest rates, has simply made it difficult for banks to make money. We rate Bush’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-15335	Says Chris Christie "vetoed equal pay for women 3 times. He only let the bill pass once it became a damaging campaign issue."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/13/ultraviolet/did-chris-christie-veto-equal-pay-women-ultraviole/	As part of a message that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is hostile to women’s issues, a political group claimed that he vetoed legislation that was intended to give women equal pay. Ultraviolet, a women’s rights group, posted an image on Facebook on June 30, 2015, titled "4 facts about Chris Christie." The second item read, "Vetoed equal pay for women 3 times. He only let the bill pass once it became a damaging campaign issue." We checked into all four of the claims listed on the image and found this one was misleading and only gives half the story. (Read our story on the rest here.) The bills In September 2012, the New Jersey Legislature passed four bills designed to narrow the gender pay gap. Christie signed one of the bills, gave one an absolute veto, and the other two conditional vetoes. Here is a breakdown of each bill and Christie’s actions: • A-2647: Mandated a statewide requirement for employers to notify employees of the right to be free from benefits and pay discrimination. This bill was signed by Christie. • A-2649: This bill called for government contractors to report employee gender and compensation information to the New Jersey Department of Labor. It got an absolute veto from Christie, who said of the bill, "These new reporting requirements fail to advance sound policy over senseless bureaucracy." • A-2648: This bill extended protections for employees who reveal discriminatory actions in their workplaces. Christie conditionally vetoed this bill, saying in his veto message that he would pass it if the Legislature would "incorporate it into LAD (New Jersey Law Against Discrimination Act)." It was eventually signed by Christie in August 2013 after his recommended changes were made. • A-2650: This bill would have granted back pay to victims of pay discrimination and was modeled on the federal Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. It also was conditionally vetoed by Christie, but it was never revived. Despite initially vetoing three bills intended to narrow the wage gap by increasing transparency and protections against discriminatory practices, two of the four bills in the legislative package sent to Christie were eventually signed. The timing of the signing Ultraviolet’s claim that Christie only passed one of the bills, A-2648, once it became a "damaging campaign issue," is inaccurate. The timing of the bill’s signing in August 2013, just before the Nov. 5, 2013, gubernatorial election, seems to be coincidental at best. Christie spokesman Brian Murray noted that Christie offered his recommendations through a conditional veto almost a year before his re-election. "He has absolutely no control over when the legislative branch, controlled in both houses by Democrat majorities, may choose to adopt his recommendations," Murray said. Also, the New Jersey governor is given a deadline of 10 days to sign a bill once the Legislature votes to implement the governor’s recommendations. Though the bill did pass only months before the election, we confirmed that Christie had given it a conditional veto more than a year prior. Effectiveness One final note: When we ran this claim by people who study pay discrimination in New Jersey, they said that Christie approved the bills that were less aggressive in addressing pay disparity. Compared to other states, New Jersey was in the middle of the pack with an earning ratio of 79 percent. Women had a median annual earning of $47,878, while men earned $60,878. Since the two bills (A-2647 and A-2648) became law in 2012 and 2013, New Jersey has seen little improvement in the gender wage gap. Our ruling Ultraviolet said Chris Christie "vetoed equal pay for women 3 times. He only let the bill pass once it became a damaging campaign issue." Christie did veto three bills that were intended to narrow the gender wage gap, but it was out of a legislative package of four bills, and he eventually signed two of them into law. Additionally, It is unlikely that Christie only let one of the bills pass because it became a damaging campaign issue, considering Christie gave a conditional veto and recommended changes to the bill over a year before his re-election. The claim has an element of truth, so we rate it Mostly False.	None	Ultraviolet	None	None	None	2015-07-13T16:27:29	2015-06-30	['None']
pomt-12115	Says there is proof Democrats hired actors to plan violence in Charlottesville.	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/18/blog-posting/blog-posts-wrongly-say-theres-proof-democrats-hire/	An Internet post that claimed Democrats planned the demonstrations against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., tracks back to a Craigslist ad calling for people to be paid for filler crowds in North Carolina. "Internet sleuths just found the smoking gun on Dems planning violence in Charlottesville," declared the headline on an Aug. 14, 2017, post on NewsUpToday.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook’s efforts to curb fake news on the site. The post, which we also saw on other websites, said that violent clashes Aug. 12 between white nationalists and people demonstrating against their Unite the Right rally were possibly the result of a coordinated protest. "The media flurry after the confusing happenings in Charlottesville yesterday is fueling violence in this country and it appears that this is exactly what the Dems want," the post read. "Users on Reddit found a potential smoking gun Craigslist post seeking to hire protesters in Charlotte, North Carolina for ‘rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes.’" The post included an image of a Craigslist ad for a company called Crowds On Demand, "a Los Angeles-based Public Relations firm specializing in innovative events." The ad, which said it had been posted a week prior, was "looking for enthusiastic actors and photographers in the Charlotte, NC area to participate in our events." Note that said Charlotte, N.C., and not Charlottesville, Va. Both cities were named for King George III’s wife, Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, but that’s about all the two places share. Online detectives focused on a portion of the ad that read, "Our events include everything from rallies to protests to corporate PR stunts to celebrity scenes." It said the pay was typically $25 per hour, plus travel expenses to an event. The Craigslist ad asked interested people to reply to the ad, which has been repeatedly flagged for removal and then restored by Craigslist. During the research for this fact-check, it had been flagged and restored twice, but is unavailable as of this writing. "This is highly suspicious and almost suggests that these people were being hired for the rally in Charlottesville this weekend to impersonate ‘white nationalists’ and incite violence so it would look like they were at fault for the chaos," the NewsUpToday.com post read. That’s hardly a "smoking gun" implicating Democrats in faking protests and causing violence. The Craiglist ad proves nothing at all, beyond the fact that Crowds On Demand is a real company. Crowds On Demand hires crowds for events, including political rallies. It’s run by a UCLA political science graduate named Adam Swart, who started the company in 2012. Swart has said that his company has been hired by political campaigns before, and that Crowds On Demand will work with any political party. Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., for example, had paid Crowds On Demand $15 a head for people to attend events during his 2013 New York City mayoral run, the New York Post reported. Donald Trump’s presidential campaign also used crowd-hiring services, although they denied it at first. Trump used a different crowd-filling company. Swart did not return multiple phone calls and emails from PolitiFact asking for comment. He did provide a statement to Snopes.com saying Crowds On Demand didn’t work with either the Unite the Right rally or the counter-protesters. "We were not involved in any capacity with the recent tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those impacted by the violence," the statement read. Some liberal event organizers we contacted denied using any service to hire protesters. Walter Heinecke, an associate professor of educational research, statistics and evaluation at the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education, had obtained permits for liberal counter-demonstrations in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. (Trump had falsely claimed protesters on the left hadn’t gotten permits.) "As far as I know, and I am very connected to various protest groups involved, there was no use of this kind of company," Heinecke told us. Scott Huffman, who heads the anti-Trump group Indivisible Charlotte in North Carolina, said he had quickly coordinated a candlelight vigil in Charlotte the evening after the attack in Charlottesville. He said close to 400 people attended after he posted a Facebook event inviting people to gather the evening of Aug. 13. Crowds On Demand was in no way affiliated with that vigil, he said. "At no time has Indivisible Charlotte hired any actors to attend any of our rallies," Huffman said. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Bloggers said there is proof Democrats hired actors to plan violence in Charlottesville. Several websites implied that left-leaning protesters hired crowds to impersonate white supremacists to incite violence. They pointed to a Craigslist ad for California-based Crowds On Demand hiring paid actors in Charlotte, N.C., to join crowds at unspecified events as evidence. But wild suspicions and allegations aren’t enough to serve as proof. Crowds On Demand denied being involved, and we found no confirmation of the accusations the bloggers made. It requires a big leap in logic to presume an ad in North Carolina has anything to do with protesters clashing in Virginia. We rate this statement False.

pomt-08853	"In my attorney general's office, we've cut the budget 18 percent."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/06/bill-mccollum/bill-mccollum-says-he-slashed-attorney-generals-bu/	In a spirited hour-long FOX 13 debate broadcast on Aug. 5, 2010, Republican candidates for governor Bill McCollum and Rick Scott flung a series of accusations about each others' pasts. McCollum continued to press Scott about his time running hospital giant Columbia/HCA, saying it's hard to believe Scott didn't know the hospital chain was taking part in a massive and coordinated Medicare and Medicaid fraud scheme. Scott, meanwhile, bashed McCollum's decades of public service, saying he voted to raise taxes and fees 42 times, and wants to create an anti-business climate if elected. If you missed the debate, which is likely the last before the Aug. 24 primary, you can watch most of it in segments on Fox 13's website. If you don't have a hour, we'll just sum it up by saying the two men clearly don't like each other. We plan to check a few items from the debate. In this fact check, we wanted to focus on one exchange dealing with McCollum's government credentials as the state's attorney general. During one of the more heated moments, Scott accused McCollum of failing to control state spending. "If you look at history, when state budgets grow versus the size of the private sector, jobs go away," Scott said. "While you've been attorney general it's exploded. You've done nothing to stop it." "I'm going to reduce the size of government." McCollum responded, "In my attorney general's office, we've cut the budget by 18 percent. I do know how to run a business. I have run the attorney general's office. It has 12 offices around the state. It has 1,400 employees." McCollum's facts about the offices and employees are close enough and noncontroversial (it's about 1,300 employees in 12 offices) that we're not going to check them. But we do want to explore the claim that McCollum has cut his budget 18 percent. The governor's Office of Policy and Budget suggested we turned to the state's fiscal website, http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us. The site tracks budget figures by agency starting with the year 2000. For our purposes, we wanted to check the attorney general's budget figures starting in fiscal year 2006-2007, which was the budget passed the year before McCollum took office. That way, we'd track all the budget changes McCollum made. What we found shows that the total budget for the attorney general's office actually grew since McCollum took office, from about $173 million in 2006 to about $186 million this year. That's a 7.5 percent increase, not an 18 percent cut. We turned to the attorney general's office for an explanation. What we got is another lesson in why government is, well, government. (Now entering the bureaucratic mess of state budgeting.) While the attorney general's office has a budget of $186 million, lots of that budget is carved out into pieces that head in directions outside of McCollum's control. McCollum's office provided us with a spreadsheet that attempts to make sense of things. Click here to read it yourself, if you can make sense of it. Of the AG's $186 million budget, just about 20 percent comes from general revenues, and therefore is available to spent as McCollum sees fit. That money funds the statewide prosecutor, pays for criminal appellate division of the attorney general's office, funds McCollum's cyber crimes task force, etc. The rest of the money is tied up in trust funds that have a specific purpose, and often simply pass through the attorney general's office. A couple of examples: The attorney general's budget this year includes almost $37 million in federal money for victims' funds. That's money allocated to states based on a federal formula and is paid out to victims of a crime. Another $14.6 million in federal dollars are allocated specifically to fight against Medicaid fraud. Under that program, for every $1 the state spends through its general revenue fund, the federal government will kick in $3. Money to fund the Florida Elections Commission is included in McCollum's budget, though he has no control over it. Pass-through funding, as the AG's office calls it, accounts for more than $60 million this year alone. The rest of the attorney general's budget is paid for, ostensibly, by other state agencies who hire McCollum's lawyers. If the Department of Children and Families, for instance, pays for the equivalent of 20 lawyers, they would get 20 lawyers. If they pay for 10, they get 10. If they pay for zero, you get the point. Excluding the pass-through trust funds and the money spent on AG lawyers by other agencies, the attorney general's operational budget shrunk from $48.6 million in 2007 to $42.9 million this year, a dip of about $5.7 million, according to the AG's office. But we think using the 2006 number is more fair, because that accounts for any increase in the budget McCollum made in his first year in office. Using the 2006 number, $47.4 million, McCollum has trimmed the attorney general's operational budget about $4.5 million. Translated into a percentage, that comes to about 9.5 percent. So what gives? (Now going deeper into the bureaucratic mess of state budgeting.) The attorney general's most recent budget includes a special one-time $3.5 million allocation for Crime Stoppers. The money will be used to pay for enhancing public awareness of crime prevention methods and to train the public in personal safety principles. Typically Crime Stoppers had been funded by a $20 fine tacked on to criminal convictions, money that is then put into a trust fund. But the Legislature zeroed out the trust fund to pay for other costs. So the money was reinserted into the attorney general's operational fund for 2010 only, in order to allow time for the trust fund to be rebuilt. That shifts the budgeted amount McCollum controls down again, to $39.4 million in 2010. That's $8 million less than what was budgeted in 2006, or a 16.9 percent decrease. McCollum said matter-of-factly that he has cut the attorney general's budget 18 percent since he took office. The line leaves viewers, pretty clearly in our minds, the impression that McCollum cut the entire attorney general's budget. In fact, we know now, that he's just talking about a small portion of AG spending. We acknowledge and agree that there are lots of dollars tucked in the $186 million spending plan that McCollum cannot control, and we also note that McCollum has lowered spending in the core areas of the AG's office he oversees. But we think he missed an opportunity to be more clear with voters. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Bill McCollum	None	None	None	2010-08-06T18:57:46	2010-08-05	['None']
pomt-07409	President Obama was "raised Muslim."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/28/gordon-robertson/gordon-robertson-says-obama-was-raised-muslim/	Now that President Obama has produced a U.S. birth certificate, it’s time to move on to more pressing issues. Was the president really raised as a Muslim? Gordon Robertson, the chief executive officer of the Christian Broadcast Network in Virginia Beach, made just that statement in a recent interview with Newsmax.com. Robertson, the son of televangelist Pat Robertson, said this about the president’s religious background: "He was raised Muslim, father Muslim, went through a Muslim school and went through all of that and has come out and said ‘I want to be a Christian,’" Robertson said. Rumors that Obama was brought up Muslim were extensively explored and debunked when he was running for president in 2007. But some perceptions linger. Robertson brought up the president's religious background in the context of a broader statement on how Obama embraced Christianity after what Robertson said was a Muslim upbringing. That suggests Robertson sees this as a positive story of how the nation’s leader came to embrace Christianity over Islam. We asked Chris Roslan, a spokesman for the Christian Broadcasting Network, where Robertson got his information about Obama. Roslan sent us an e-mail with Robertson’s response. The CBN executive cited a passage from Obama’s 2006 autobiography, "The Audacity of Hope" in which Obama noted he first went to a Catholic school and then to a predominantly Muslim school while living in Indonesia from ages 6 to 10. Robertson also pointed to an excerpt from a 2009 speech Obama made at Cairo University in which the president said his father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims. Robertson also said that Obama’s biological father was raised Muslim. None of what Robertson cited proves that Obama himself was "raised Muslim," which implies the president was raised in the faith and actively practiced. So what’s the story behind Obama’s religious background? Some conservatives have argued that simply having Muslim ancestors means Obama himself was Muslim before embracing Christianity. The evangelical minister Franklin Graham made that argument in an Aug. 19, 2010 interview on CNN when he said the "seed of Islam" passes from the father to Obama. An Aug. 26, 2010 a PolitiFact national article critiqued Graham’s comments, saying while it’s true Islam scholars say that in Muslim cultures children of Muslims are generally assumed to be Muslim themselves, what really makes one an adherent to Islam is their own beliefs and practices. PolitiFact national also found that family accounts suggest Obama’s biological father, Barack Hussein Obama, Sr. was an atheist who had little influence on his son because he and Obama’s mother split shortly after the president was born in 1961. So was Obama ever a practicing Muslim in his early years? His presidential campaign said he never was and that he was not raised in any religion. Various news articles and biographies -- including the president’s own writings -- indicate he had a secular upbringing. Articles interviewing Obama’s neighbors while he was in Indonesia indicate he sometimes attended a mosque with his stepfather. Some of the web commentary has focused on the fact that Obama was listed in his Catholic school records as a Muslim as evidence that was his faith while in Indonesia. But a number of stories suggested he may have been listed as Muslim simply because Obama’s stepfather was Muslim, though press accounts suggest Lolo Soetoro was not particularly devout. Officials at the predominantly Muslim school that Obama attended has said the public academy is open to people of all faiths. A March, 2007 story in the Chicago Tribune said that when Obama was attending 4th grade, Muslim children would spend two hours a week studying Islam while Christian children would spend that time studying Christianity. Even the passage from "Audacity of Hope" that Robertson cited in his e-mail shows the president’s upbringing included some ambivalence towards religion. "My mother was less concerned with me learning the catechism or puzzling out the meaning of the muezzin’s call to evening prayer than she was with whether I was properly learning my multiplication tables," Obama wrote. The president has said he became a Christian in his 20s while a community organizer in Chicago. To sum up: Robertson said Obama was raised Muslim. Obama’s own writings, independent biographies and news articles show he had a secular childhood. Sure, he went to an Indonesian school where most of the children were Muslim and there are accounts that he sometimes attended a mosque with his Islamic stepfather. But there is no evidence that the president was a practicing Muslim raised in the faith. By saying Obama was raised Muslim, Robertson is repeating a debunked claim.

pomt-00954	ISIS sends out "90,000 social (media) messages a day."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/19/hillary-mann-leverett/cnn-expert-islamic-state-posts-90000-social-media-/	The Islamic State group, or ISIS, has fused two things that until now were separated by centuries -- medieval brutality and the hyperactive use of social media. And while tweeted images of beheadings and immolations draw the biggest headlines, the pro-ISIS propaganda stream is much broader, full of visions of a resurgent Islam seeking soldiers in its cause. Former National Security Council staffer Hillary Mann Leverett focused on this part of the ISIS recruiting machine during a Feb. 17, 2015, interview on CNN’s New Day. Leverett said American military operations since the Iraq War have given ISIS plenty of material to exploit. "This is what the Islamic State, and al-Qaida before it, has been able to use in their rhetoric," Leverett said. "There are 90,000 social messages a day. All they have to do is put real footage of what the United States has done in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya." The huge use of social media by ISIS is not in question. We were curious though about the source of the 90,000 figure. That seems like a lot of tweets and Facebook posts for a single organization to crank out. Leverett pointed to us a New York Times article about the expansion of the State Department’s Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications to thwart the Islamic State message machine. "With the Islamic State and its supporters producing as many as 90,000 tweets and other social media responses every day, American officials acknowledge they have a tough job ahead to blunt the group’s digital momentum," the reporters wrote. That doesn’t exactly say where the number originated, but other news organizations certainly have repeated the stat in the past few days. The earliest use we could find was in a report from the British House of Commons Defence Committee on Feb. 5, 2015. In a section focused on the threat of ISIS in Iraq, the report said, "They have proved themselves adept in the use of social media, sending 90,000 messages a day." (We asked the Defence Committee where it got that number, but Parliament is in recess and key staff are on vacation. We will update this item if we hear from them.) Independently, we discovered two separate research groups that track the social media activity of the Islamic State. J.M. Berger is a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution who recently testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives about terrorists’ use of social media. With funding from Google, Berger and his technologist colleague Jonathon Morgan set up a system to capture the scope of pro-ISIS messaging. They found that in the fall of 2014, there were at least 45,000 Twitter accounts used by ISIS supporters. With that as a starting point, Berger told PunditFact that 90,000 messages a day is likely a conservative number. "My best estimate is something over 200,000 a day, including retweets, but that comes with a lot of caveats," Berger said. Berger said the figure includes supporters as well as actual members of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. "It is not entirely possible to break down members vs. fanboys and the bulk of accounts don't visibly differentiate," Berger said. "But a plurality of the accounts we examined for the study appeared to be based in Iraq and Syria." Berger offered two other cautionary notes: • The numbers are driven by a small number of high over-performers, probably fewer than 2,000 accounts that often tweet in bursts of 50 or more tweets per day as part of a deliberate strategy. • There are also deceptive techniques such as the use of bots and purchased retweets to inflate these numbers. Berger said his analysis took steps to eliminate as much of this noise as possible but very probably didn't get it all. Voices from the Blogs, a research service based in Milan, Italy, tracks tweets written in Arabic. This is a subset of the total number of tweets related to the Islamic State, since tweets are sent in many different languages. One of the lead researchers is Luigi Curini, an associate professor of political science at the University of Milan. Curini told PunditFact that while he and his colleagues Stefano Iacus and Andrea Ceron saw between 100,000 and 150,000 Arabic language tweets each day from October to January, many were judged to take no clear stance on ISIS and of the remainder, only about 20 to 25 percent favored the extremist group. After taking those factors into account, the high-end estimate of pro-ISIS Arabic language tweets averaged about 38,000 per day. Daily events will shape the Twitter traffic. Curini was struck by the impact of the murders of the Charlie Hebdo journalists. "The sentiment pro-ISIS actually decreased soon after the Paris attack, especially in the European community writing in Arabic language," Curini said. "But this drop lasted just a few days." Still, right after the violence in Paris, two media groups with ties to ISIS, Al-Battar and Al-Ghuraba, launched a campaign to inspire copycat killings. According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, a private media surveillance firm, they fired off tweets and circulated images like these for others to share. Berger’s analysis included all languages and, like Curini’s work, tallied only the pro-ISIS messages. The efforts of both groups show a high volume of tweeting, although some significant fraction of that comes from fans of ISIS, rather than the group itself. Nevertheless, regardless of the source, whether insider, fan, or computer-generated, Berger said these messages reach a shared audience for whom the source might be irrelevant. This makes targeting a counter message very difficult. Our ruling Leverett said the Islamic State group sends out 90,000 social media messages each day. While the exact source of that figure is a bit unclear, one independent researcher has data that point to much a higher number. There could be as many as 200,000 pro-ISIS tweets a day. That includes re-tweets and some generated by computer programs. A lower figure from an Italian-based group looked only at Arabic language tweets. However, while it is difficult to know for sure, a large share of these messages come from outside the ISIS organization itself. To that extent, the data undercut the idea that the Islamic State group dictates the precise propaganda message in all of the social media posts. With that caveat in mind, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Hillary Mann Leverett	None	None	None	2015-02-19T14:37:16	2015-02-17	['None']
pomt-05311	Taxpayers subsidize 80 percent of each MARTA trip	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/may/18/brett-bittner/marta-subsidy-claim-derailed-facts/	In a recent Marietta Daily Journal story about opposition to the July 31 regional transportation referendum, the executive director of the Libertarian Party of Georgia took a swipe at MARTA for relying too heavily on taxpayers. "When you take a look at what MARTA costs to operate, the taxpayers are subsidizing about 80 percent of it for each trip that’s taken, so there are a lot of opportunities there with the money that’s being proposed especially in the transit perspective," Brett Bittner said in an article published May 2. Bittner told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he came to his conclusion by visiting the MARTA website, looking at the per-trip costs, subtracting the cost of a fare and attributing the rest to the taxpayer. Transit systems across the nation rely on tax subsidies to operate. But do taxpayers foot the bill for MARTA to that great of an extent? First, let’s look at what MARTA’s ridership pays into the system. MARTA has one of the highest fare rates in the nation following a fare hike from $2 to $2.50 per ride last fall. Helped by a recent fare increase, the agency projects fare revenue this year of $130.3 million – 31 percent of its operating costs. Last year, fares covered 29 percent of operating costs. Simple math says Bittner’s figures are askew. If riders are paying almost a third, taxpayers can’t be subsidizing 80 percent. "Our Libertarian friend is dead wrong," MARTA spokesman Lyle Harris concluded. But how far off is he? Let’s look at the taxpayer side of the MARTA coin. The largest part of MARTA’s current $413.8 million in transit costs is paid by local sales tax. MARTA gets $201.2 million from the penny tax collected in Fulton and DeKalb counties and the city of Atlanta. On top of this, the federal government kicks in $37.8 million. A sore point for MARTA backers is that the state of Georgia makes no direct contribution to operate the city’s transit service. In all, MARTA is paying for bus, rail and other services with $239 million in local and federal taxpayer money. The service rounds out its revenue pie with some other sources of income. Advertising on buses, parking fees and land leases bring the non-taxpayer funds to $152.1 million. MARTA tapped its reserve fund to plug a $22.7 million hole in its operating budget. Officials say the reserve fund is "mixed" with taxes and other revenue, but they said the money pulled for this year’s operating budget comes from the sale of real estate decades ago and some other non-tax sources. If the deficit persists, MARTA may end up pulling more tax money out of reserves to fund transit in coming years. With figures in hand, the rest is just math: Taxpayers subsidize 57.8 percent of MARTA’s operating costs. Ten years ago, fares made up more than a third of MARTA’s budget, and while ridership is down from 2002, that’s not why taxpayers are being asked to foot more of the bill. Fares increased 13 percent in actual dollars from 2002 to 2011, but the service’s operating expenses increased 38 percent. That gap has to be made up somewhere, and Bittner is right about where, even if the exact percentage is off. "I only looked at the cost per trip and the fare per trip. I didn’t use the ancillary figures in the budget," he said. "We’re still subsidizing over half as taxpayers, especially those of us who live and work in Fulton and DeKalb." In rebuttal, Harris points out every mode of transportation – including road building – is subsidized by taxes to some extent. That argument aside, Bittner was significantly off in assigning 80 percent of the costs of a MARTA trip to the taxpayer, even if he stands by the larger point. We rate his claim as Mostly False.

pomt-12547	"Tampa man loses testicles after trying to 'fill scuba tank with weed smoke.'"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/18/blog-posting/tale-intoxicated-diver-losing-his-testicles-explos/	An Internet post claimed that an explosion blew off a Tampa man’s testicles while he was trying to puff marijuana smoke into a scuba tank. A lot of weird things happen in Florida. This isn’t one of them. The story is fake. "Tampa man loses testicles after trying to 'fill scuba tank with weed smoke'," read the headline on an April 13, 2017, article on FloridaSunPost.com. The story was flagged by Facebook users who suspected the story may be fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curtail fake news. The story said a Tampa man named Darren Winters "had consumed a copious amount of alcohol" when he decided to invite friends over to witness him use a contraption he dubbed a "scuba bong." The recreational diver had planned to blow smoke into a scuba tank with a compressor, then inhale it through a regulator, the story read. Winters reportedly knocked the tank off a workbench and it exploded, with shrapnel severing his genitals. While those details are graphic, they’re also completely fabricated. FloridaSunPost.com is a fake news website designed to look like a traditional news outlet. The exact same story appeared on BostonLeader.com on Sept. 16, 2016, with the location changed to Boston. The name of the victim was changed to Michael Fitzpatrick — although the surname Palmer was cited once, too. Where did Palmer come from? Another version of the same story was posted on Sept. 3 at IsThatLegit.com, but this time in Calgary, Canada. The victim in that story was named Robert Palmer. These sites and others, such as the MississippiHerald.com, AlabamaObserver.com and DenverInquirer.com, certainly appear related. The sites we found all were privately registered through a domain service in Toronto.

pomt-04340	"Connecticut's take on slot machines is 25 cents on the dollar. And the state's take on table games: zero."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/25/diane-hurley/ceo-newport-grand-slot-parlor-says-connecticut-get/	On Election Day, Rhode Islanders will decide whether they want to allow Newport Grand and Twin River, in Lincoln, to offer table games such as roulette and blackjack in addition to their video slot machines. The two gambling businesses say they need the table games to compete with up to three casinos expected to open in Massachusetts as early as 2017. If voters approve the expansion, the state would get up to 18 percent of revenue from those new games. (The state already gets 61 percent from slot machines at Twin River and Newport Grand -- a projected $336 million this year.) During an Oct. 14, 2012, appearance on WJAR’s "10 News Conference," Newport Grand Chief Executive Officer Diane Hurley said that the 18-percent cut would be a good deal for Rhode Island. She compared it to what Connecticut gets from table games in that state’s two casinos, Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods. "Connecticut's take on slot machines is 25 cents on the dollar. And the state's take on table games: zero," she said. We decided to see if she was bluffing or if she had the cards. We quickly confirmed that Hurley’s numbers were correct. Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun, are both operated by Native American tribes.The tribes negotiated identical agreements with the state that give Connecticut 25 percent share of slot machine revenue at the casinos. That revenue is defined as the amount of money gamblers put into the machines minus the prize money paid out. And, as Hurley correctly noted, neither Foxwoods nor Mohegan Sun pays any share of their table game revenue to the state. Here’s how that arrangement came about. The Mashantucket Pequots won federal recognition as a sovereign tribe in 1983. The status was significant because under federal law, any form of gambling a state allows can be conducted by a tribe, but without any state regulation. Connecticut allowed churches and similar charitable organizations to hold bingo nights. In 1986, the tribe used that exemption to open a high-stakes bingo hall on its reservation in Ledyard, Connecticut, with none of the limits on prizes or hours that state law required. Then, in 1992, the Pequots used a law that allowed charitable casino night events to offer table games like blackjack, roulette and poker, but also free from state regulation. Foxwoods was born. The federal laws that made the tribe immune from state gambling laws also meant the tribe didn’t have to share its table-game revenues with the state. But that wasn’t the case with slot machines. Because no state law allowed them under any circumstances, the tribe needed the state’s approval. The result was a 1993 agreement that let the Pequots add slot machines, and gave the state a 25 percent cut of the revenue. In 1996 the Mohegan tribe opened its casino, Mohegan Sun, in Uncasville under the same arrangement. Last year, according to the Connecticut gambling division, gamblers dropped $15.7 billion into the approximately 12,500 slot machines at Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods. About 92 percent of that was paid out in jackpots. The rest went to the house, with 25 percent to the state. Hurley’s accounting of Connecticut’s cut is accurate. We rate her claim True.

pomt-08195	Says President Obama has grown the federal government payroll by 141,000 workers and wants to add 125,000 more.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/24/reince-priebus/wisconsin-republican-party-chairman-reince-priebus/	Eager to ridicule the economic stimulus package, Republicans long have pounded President Barack Obama for overseeing a rise in federal government employees even while private-sector payrolls have shriveled. It started over the summer, when two Ohio congressmen -- including soon-to-be U.S. House Speaker John Boehner -- separately claimed the federal payroll had jumped by 400,000 or 590,000 since Obama took office in January 2009. Those claims were greatly inflated by including temporary U.S. Census workers, PolitiFact National found. Now the GOP is back with a new set of numbers. In the wake of election victories, officials are working them into interviews and even social-networking messages, such as this Nov. 16, 2010 Twitter post from Reince Priebus (@ReincePriebus), chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin: "Obama has grown fed. payroll by 141k workers-not counting Census, postal, & uniformed military. Wants to add 125k more." Priebus weighed in on this national topic -- coincidentally we assume -- about a week after his name came up in speculation about succeeding Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele at some point. Priebus’ tweet linked to a Fox News.com story that quoted U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who is in line to run a House subcommittee on federal employment. Chaffetz was pushing a 10 percent across-the-board pay cut for federal employees. He told Fox that Obama had added 141,000 federal workers. The Fox story, without attribution, added: The president wants to hire 125,000 more workers." Since the numbers had changed from the summer, we wondered how the new ones added up. First some context and history. Federal employment figures are cyclical. They are lower now than 20 years ago. The federal payroll began a dive in the 1990s, rose again after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, held pretty steady for much of the last decade -- then began a sharp climb up in 2008, the last year of George W. Bush’s presidency. The White House and private analysts attribute much of the rise this decade to homeland security and civilian defense positions related to fighting two wars and international terrorism. Let’s start with how much the federal work force has gone up. During Obama’s tenure, the number of federal workers has increased by about 141,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics -- though it is in large part a product of Bush’s last budget. Priebus and Chaffetz did not include census workers, avoiding the misleading approach taken by Boehner and others. They also excluded U.S. Postal Service workers in their count, which tallies some 2.19 million civilian federal workers. That makes the increase much larger than it otherwise would be, since the postal workforce is shrinking. Got that? If the postal workers cuts were included, the overall increase in employees under Obama would be about 40,000, or a modest 1.4 percent increase in the workforce. By leaving the postal service out, as the GOP does, the increase is 141,000 jobs, or almost 7 percent. That’s a huge difference. Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, says postal workers are federal employees and should be included. But government statisticians, the White House and some private watchdog groups routinely exclude postal workers in their reports. So Chaffetz and Priebus are not off base -- and both were careful to note which workers they meant. A second caveat is more important. Obama was elected in November of 2008 and took office in January of 2009. An analysis by Cato, the libertarian think tank, said the vast majority of spending for the 2008-’09 year -- which began a month before the election -- was from Bush-implemented changes. If you start counting with the first full fiscal year under Obama, the job increase under Obama is half of the 141,000. But it’s also true that Obama picked up the ball from Bush and ran with it. Let’s look at part two of the Priebus claim: that Obama wants to add 125,000 more workers. It’s based on the Fox story, which did not attribute that number to anyone. The 125,000 figure is an apparent reference to fiscal year 2011. But the 125,000 figure is not the projected job growth in fiscal year 2011 -- it’s just new hires, according to an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, which provides research for The Washington Post. Priebus’ tweet makes it sound as if that 125,000 would come on top of the 141,000 increase. But two-thirds of the 125,000 hires will replace departing federal workers, the Partnership estimated. So those positions won’t grow the number of federal jobs. We won’t know until next fall, when the 2011 fiscal year ends, how many net jobs were added across the government. But like any good charge, a pointed tweet doesn’t wait. So, our evaluation won’t wait either. Like others in his party, state GOP chairman Reince Priebus’ claim on federal hiring takes a statistical approach that makes the 2009-’10 trend more dramatic than under another method. And the claim pins the entire growth on Obama, while ignoring the budget implemented by Bush. But it’s a legitimate number, commonly used, and clearly defined. The second claim is off base, using a new-hire number as a proxy for job growth to suggest that Obama would nearly double the two-year job growth in one year. The mixed message earns Priebus a Half True.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2010-11-24T09:00:00	2010-11-16	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-11065	A Chinese proverb says, "Those who say it can not be done, should not interrupt those doing it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/22/ivanka-trump/no-evidence-link-ivanka-trump-quote-chinese-prover/	Ivanka Trump tweeted a subtle dig at critics of her father before he became the first sitting president to meet with a North Korean leader. "Those who say it can not be done, should not interrupt those doing it," she wrote, referencing a "Chinese proverb" as the source of the quote. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We noticed a lot of confusion on American and Chinese social media platforms about whether there really is a Chinese proverb that says this. One user on Weibo, China’s most popular social media website, proposed genuine Chinese proverbs resembling Ivanka Trump’s tweet, such as "Those who can’t eat the grapes will call them sour," and the Confucian saying, "That which you would not do yourself, do not force upon others." The official account of Sina, the tech company responsible for the making of Weibo, posted a translation of Ivanka Trump’s tweet on the platform, followed by a call for assistance: "We really can’t think of what proverb this is. Please help!" After seeing all the disbelief from netizens around the world, we were curious whether there was any truth to Trump’s attribution of the quote. After some digging, we found no evidence that the saying is of Chinese origin. The White House did not return a request for clarification. Questing on Quote Investigator We started by searching the quote on Google, and found a website that tracks the origin of memorable quotations named Quote Investigator. (We came across the website in our last report on a misattributed quote by Ivanka Trump.) Garson O’Toole, the founder of Quote Investigator (and whose real name is Gregory F. Sullivan) is a former teacher and research scientist in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. (He told us prefers to use the "distinctive pseudonym" Garson O’Toole in all matters pertaining to quotation tracing.) O’Toole told us that he works to find "early instances of variations of a quotation which are syntactically distinct but semantically similar" from databases of books, magazines and newspapers. O’Toole traced the first appearance of one iteration of Ivanka Trump’s tweet back to 1902, when the quotation, "Things move along so rapidly nowadays that people saying ‘It can’t be done’ are always being interrupted by somebody doing it" appeared in the New York-based humor magazine Puck. According to Quote Investigator, it was reprinted by newspapers for the next few decades. Then, a 1962 periodical about adult education included the expression, "Confucius say: Man who say it cannot be done, should not interrupt man doing it." That’s pretty similar to Ivanka Trump’s tweet, but one expert noted that the template "Confucius say" is a format that is frequently used for jokes and witticisms. "Calling it a Chinese proverb is like a century ago when the fashion was to say ‘Confucius said…’ in front of a stupid remark or a weak joke," said Willard J. Peterson, professor of East Asian studies and history at Princeton University. The quote showed up again in 1974, when advocates for solar energy sent a letter that was eventually published in a record of a U.S. Senate hearing. The letter also credited Confucius for the saying. The quote was again ascribed to Confucius in different outlets in 1977 and 1996, suggesting that the belief that the saying is Chinese in origin may have stemmed from a misunderstood joke. That’s where our trail ran cold. So we turned to experts. Experts question origins of Ivanka Trump tweet No expert we spoke to could confirm that it was a Chinese proverb. "As far as I know, there is no way for this quote to be reasonably attributed to anyone in the Chinese intellectual tradition," said Isaac Stone Fish, a senior fellow at the Asia Society’s Center on U.S.-China Relations. Stone Fish said the quote sounded like an American’s take on Chinese wisdom. O’Toole wrote to us that "the precise phrasing of statements often evolves over time." In this case, he believes that the modern iteration of the statement that Ivanka Trump quoted "evolved from the 1902 statement" that was included in Puck. As for why the misattribution of quotes to Chinese origin is commonplace, Paul R. Goldin, professor of East Asian languages and civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania, told us that his guess is that "people tend to say such-and-such is a Chinese proverb because (at least until recently) few Westerners were in any position to challenge such claims." Goldin also said that "China isn't the only false source that is invoked for phony quotations and proverbs," noting that there’s also a tendency for speakers to misattribute "nonsense" to sources like Oscar Wilde and Mark Twain. Meanwhile, Peterson told us that he thinks using the established words of others can be "a way of not taking responsibility for what you are saying," especially if those words are likely to offend the listener. This wasn’t the first time Trump has confused her Chinese proverbs. Quote Investigator considers the linkage of the saying "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life" to Confucius to be "spurious." But she previously attributed the saying to the Chinese philosopher twice, once in 2013 and once in 2014. Our ruling Ivanka Trump tweeted, "Those who say it can not be done, should not interrupt those doing it" and attributed the quote to a "Chinese proverb." We found no evidence that links her quote to a Chinese proverb. Similar versions of the quote have been circulating for over 100 years and have been attributed to Confucius, possibly as a joke. Experts also could not speak to the quote’s origins, but said it was unlikely of Chinese origin. We rate this claim False.	None	Ivanka Trump	None	None	None	2018-06-22T09:00:00	2018-06-11	['China']
pomt-14918	"If you look at the three people on the (debate) stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/01/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-rubio-cruz-and-paul-have-combined-tw/	Three senators running for the Republican presidential nomination have slim records in Congress, said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. On NBC’s Meet the Press Nov. 1, Bush said that he, on the other hand, "got to be governor of a state and accomplish big things." "This is about public service, about solving problems. If you look at the three people on the stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored. If you look at Hillary Clinton, in 10 years, three bills she sponsored that became law. This is the gridlock that I'm running to try to break up." We wondered if Bush was right that the three sitting senators he debated against Oct. 28 -- Rand Paul, R-Ky., Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- have only had a combined two bills become law so far. (Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is also a sitting senator running for the Republican nomination, but Bush did not include Graham in his count, as he appeared in an earlier debate for candidates with the lowest poll numbers.) (In March, we looked into Cruz’s track record, and we looked at Clinton’s in June.) We evaluated Cruz, Rubio and Paul’s legislative records using Congressional Quarterly’s BillTrack database and GovTrack’s advanced legislation search. We found that Bush’s statement is accurate in that the three senators have sponsored just two bills that eventually became law. But the claim leaves out some important context, such as outside factors working against the senators and the fact that this is an incomplete measure of a senator’s impact in Congress. Put another way, it’s unclear how much you should read into what Bush said. Serving since 2013, Cruz has been the primary sponsor on 57 bills, one of which has become law. Rubio and Paul both joined the Senate in 2011. Rubio has sponsored 106 bills, and President Barack Obama signed one of them into law. Paul has sponsored 141 bills but none has yet to become law. Cruz’s bill, enacted in 2014, denied admission to the United States any United Nations representative who poses a national security threat (a response to Iran’s chosen U.N. representative). The bill was uncontroversial and passed unanimously in both the Senate and the House. Obama signed Rubio’s bill in 2015. This law, which authorized the State Department to support women’s rights in developing countries, was also uncontroversial and passed both chambers unanimously. All three also have their names on laws as cosponsors: Cruz has three, Rubio has 18 and Paul has four. The caveats to Bush’s claim So it’s true that Cruz, Rubio and Paul haven’t had many of their ideas signed into law. But there are several caveats to Bush’s claims. Seniority matters. Cruz has only been in Congress for 2.5 years; Paul and Rubio have been there for 4.5. In 2014, National Journal analyzed which senators have sponsored or cosponsored the most bills that eventually became law and found that the longer a senator had been in office, the more bills they passed. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has passed more than 740 bills and has been in the Senate since 1977. At the time of National Journal’s report, the median was 78 bills passed and belonged to Sen. David Vitter, R-La., who has been a senator since 2005. Who’s in control matters. Until this year, Republicans were the minority party in the Senate, putting Cruz, Rubio and Paul at a disadvantage. It’s expected that the majority leader will schedule bills for his own party more frequently than for the minority, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. Even within their own party, more junior members’ priorities are at the back of the line. "First-term senators have a lot of headwinds, particularly when in the minority," Huder told PolitiFact when we wrote about Cruz’s record back in March. That said, the Senate’s design allows for individual members to make a difference, even if they’re not in the majority, said Sarah Binder, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in legislative politics. They make a difference in ways other than just passing laws. They can sponsor amendments to bills, for example, or their bills can get absorbed into broad omnibus legislation. Cruz successfully sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that will give Purple Hearts to those killed or wounded in the shooting at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009. They can also use their platform to shape the national conversation, such as Paul’s efforts to raise awareness of privacy issues and National Security Agency surveillance of citizens' phone and other records. Or, they can put a plug in the opposing party’s agenda, like when Cruz spearheaded efforts to block presidential appointments to push his priorities. "That's not quite the same as shepherding a bill into law, but it's an example of the ways in which merely counting bills enacted gives short shrift to other ways in which senators can make a difference," Binder said. Effectiveness outside of sponsorship. Another problem with simply counting the number of bills passed is that it doesn’t account for individual bills’ political salience. Binder noted that Rubio played a major role in crafting the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration reform bill, and even though that bill did not become law, it was an important piece of legislation that continues to be relevant. And the Senate is only one-third of the lawmaking process (the other parts being the House and the president), so many factors that go into passing a law is out of the sponsor’s hands, Huder said. A Cruz spokesperson told us that his impact in Congress is demonstrated through more actions than just the number of laws passed. We also reached out to the campaigns for Rubio and Paul, and we'll update this post if we hear back. Looking at Clinton, Sanders Because Bush mentioned her, we wanted to briefly touch on Clinton’s record, too. Serving as the Democratic senator from New York for eight years (not 10, as Bush said), 2001 through January 2009, Clinton sponsored 416 bills, and three became law. She also co-sponsored 74 bills that were eventually enacted into law. There’s one more senator running for president: Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Of the 190 bills Sanders has sponsored since joining the Senate in 2007, two have become law. He has cosponsored 33 that were enacted. Our ruling Bush said that the three Republican senators running for president "have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored." Bush has his numbers right: Of all the bills Cruz, Rubio and Paul have sponsored combined, only two bills have been signed into law. But experts told us that this isn’t a great measurement of a legislator’s effectiveness, and there are other ways to show impact in Congress. All three senators have their fingerprints on numerous laws as cosponsors or amendment authors. We rate Bush’s claim Mostly True. Editor's note: This post has been updated to include a response from the Cruz campaign that we received after publishing the article and to clarify the senators identified by Bush in his claim.

pomt-00738	"The United States invented the community college. Nobody else had ever done anything like it."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-us-was-first-create-community/	In her bid for the White House, Hillary Clinton is lavishing attention on community colleges. She met with groups of community college students in both of the early caucus and primary states -- Iowa and New Hampshire -- and during those roundtables, Clinton sang the praises of how community colleges give a new generation of students skills to succeed in a changing job market. At a session with students and teachers at NHTI-Concord’s Community College on April 21, 2015, she said, "The United States invented the community college. Nobody else had ever done anything like it." She added, "I really support President Obama's effort to try to raise the visibility and to try to make it even more affordable for more people" to go to community college. This echoed comments she made in a visit a few days earlier to Kirkwood Community College in Monticello, Iowa. In a roundtable event with students, Clinton told her Iowa audience that "community colleges" are a "uniquely American invention ... something nobody else in the world did." We wondered if Clinton was correct that the United States was a trailblazer in this regard. So we checked with a number of historians of American education, and, despite a few quibbles, they agreed that Clinton was basically right. The experts we checked with said the idea for community colleges first emerged in 1901, when Central High School in Joliet, Ill., established a program to academically parallel the first two years of a four-year college or university. It was geared toward students who had graduated from high school and who wished to pursue a college education but didn’t want to leave their hometown. The program in Joliet was officially renamed Joliet Junior College in 1916 (and it still exists). While some of this new class of institutions were private, community colleges are largely public today. "It's fair to say that the U.S. was the first place to try to combine terminal vocational training with education intended to lead to transfer to a four-year school," said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. "It wasn't exactly invented out of thin air, and it evolved in part from vocational high schools, but it was a self-consciously distinctive institutional development." We heard two quibbles with Clinton’s comment, and they are minor. • Clinton’s terminology is slightly off. For a half century or more, the institutions in question were called "junior colleges," rather than "community colleges" -- the term Clinton used at both events. The term "community college" emerged from a 1947 report by President Harry Truman’s Commission on Higher Education. The commission’s report said, "The name used does not matter, though community college seems to describe these schools best; the important thing is that the services they perform be recognized and vastly extended." While some institutions still call themselves "junior colleges," the name "community college" gained widespread use beginning in the 1960s, said Roger L. Geiger, education professor at Penn State and author of The History of American Higher Education: Learning and Culture from the Founding to World War II. "It was the junior college, especially the public junior college, that was the distinctive American institutional invention," rather than the "community college" per se, said John R. Thelin, a professor at the University of Kentucky and author of A History of American Higher Education. • Other types of institutions, both in the United States and in other countries, shared aspects of the community college. The best example is the system of vocational education that’s common in parts of Europe, especially Germany. This system "has a much, much longer history, since it comes out of the apprenticeship system of the trade guilds from medieval times on forward," said Margaret O'Mara, historian at the University of Washington and author of Cities of Knowledge: Cold War Science and the Search for the Next Silicon Valley. A key difference between the two, Geiger said, is that community colleges in the United States bestowed university credits and encouraged students to enroll in traditional universities for their third and fourth years. Despite some similarities with European systems, "the U.S. community college system is basically a unique organizational structure — part of the nation’s rich mix of postsecondary institutions," said Christopher Loss, a public policy and higher education professor at Vanderbilt University. Our ruling Clinton said "the United States invented the community college. Nobody else had ever done anything like it." This is largely correct, though Clinton’s terminology could have been more precise. Also, other types of institutions in Europe share characteristics of community colleges. Still, the specific U.S. system is was an innovation. On balance, we rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-04-21T17:04:52	2015-04-21	['United_States']
pomt-15383	"We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/29/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-us-only-major-country-doesnt-guaran/	The U.S. Supreme Court’s recent ruling on Obamacare subsidies kept the program rolling, and Sen. Bernie Sanders was totally celebrating. Still, the independent from Vermont who is running as a Democrat for president told ABC News host George Stephanopoulos that the nation was far from out of the woods on health care. "We still have 35 million Americans without insurance," Sanders said on June 28, 2015, during an interview on This Week. "We need to join the rest of the industrialized world. We are the only major country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people as a right." We wanted to check Sanders’ claim that the United States is "the only major country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people as a right." This is a common theme for Sanders but the words he used this time muddied his message on two fronts -- which countries and what guarantee? A spokesman for Sanders, Michael Briggs, said Sanders was referring to nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We’re not sure Sanders made that entirely clear (for instance the OECD doesn’t include China or Russia, which many people would consider a major country), but we’ll put that aside for the moment. Anyway, Briggs directed us to a 2014 OECD report that found only two member countries, the United States and Mexico, lack universal health care coverage. "However, Mexico passed a law in 2004 with the goal of establishing universal coverage, and they're currently at 90 percent," Briggs said. "The ACA was never intended to establish universal coverage, and according to the January CBO estimate, 90 percent is about as good as it's going to get." We checked and Briggs is close on his numbers. In Mexico, as of 2013, public insurance reached about 86.7 percent of the people. That’s actually not much different from where America stood, if you combine public and private coverage. The figure in the United States was 84.9 percent. However, in 2015, the CBO estimated that 89 percent of American residents -- excluding undocumented immigrants -- have coverage. The number drops to 87 percent if you include undocumented residents. The median income in Mexico is so low, about a third that in the United States, that some would not group it with the stronger OECD countries. In fact, Mexico is often referred to as an emerging or developing economy as opposed to an industrialized or developed one. But since Sanders’ spokesman included it, we thought it only fair to include it, too. Beyond the raw numbers, Sanders statement highlights the tricky questions that come up when you start talking about a right to health care. Is it defined as universal coverage, or a legal right to care? The two are not identical. The gold standard Europe covers both bases. Nearly every European nation has signed and ratified the European Social Charter. That treaty’s section on health care casts health care as a right. "The system of health care must be accessible to the entire population. To that end, states should take as their main criterion for judging the success of health system reforms effective access to health care for all, without discrimination, as a basic human right." Countries follow different paths to make good on that promise. Great Britain has its national health service where the government runs the hospitals and pays the doctors and nurses. Germany and France have a more complicated mix of highly regulated public and private insurance companies, and, as in America, a law that makes insurance mandatory for everyone. Those European nations score 100 when it comes to universal coverage. But so does Australia, and Australia operates under no legal claim that health care is a right. The government’s Attorney General’s Department posted on its website "there is no Commonwealth legislation explicitly enshrining the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health." That doesn’t stop the Aussies from running an extensive system of public hospitals and a robust public health insurance program. Japan uses a different mix of tools to achieve the same results, and it too lacks a formal legal right to health care. There is a substantial body of Japanese health care law, but it has to do with creating various government programs and setting the rules of the game. A weak guarantee There are several international treaties and conventions that speak of the obligation of countries to provide for the health of their residents. The list includes the World Health Organization constitution and the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The United States signed and ratified the former, but is literally one of a handful of countries that has not ratified the latter. For some, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a landmark document that comes very close to asserting health care as a right. The treaty’s language is ambitious. It speaks of "the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health." Countries that get behind it promise that they will aim to create the "conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness." But the convention’s legal heft is considerably less than its stated goals. It pushes no country to spend beyond its "available resources," a quantity that could be whatever the leaders say it is. Lawrence Gostin is the director of Georgetown University’s O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Gostin said the convention lacks teeth. "These international obligations are vague and unenforceable so really don’t translate into a ‘right’ in all states," Gostin said. For Gostin, the test of a nation’s commitment should be measured by the facts on the ground. "Does it provide even reasonably fair access to the entire population, and is there a way to enforce or implement the right," Gostin said. "By those measures, the U.S. has many entitlements to health care, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and ACA subsidies. Yes there are many left out but that is true in lots of countries, including China that provides a minuscule amount of health dollars to rural residents." Whether China is an industrialized country of the sort Sanders mentioned is a matter of debate, but China helps illustrate the difference between a right in law and a right in practice. China has ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. On top of that, its Constitution commits the state to provide health services and facilities "all for the protection of the people's health." But the record of the world’s most populous nation is checkered to say the least. David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a Boston-based health policy group, wrote about the evolution of health care in China. In an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Blumenthal wrote that about 95 percent of the population has access to modest coverage. "The government has decided to provide all Chinese some protection against the cost of illness, not necessarily as a matter of right, but as a matter of fact," Blumenthal told PolitiFact. Ake Blomqvist, a health care economist at Carleton University in Canada, has a dimmer view of the connection between China’s legal promises and what it delivers. China might have signed that UN convention but that has had limited effect. "In reality the majority of people in China are at risk of not being able to receive even urgently needed health care if they are unlucky enough to require something that is expensive," Blomqvist said. Our ruling Sanders said that the United States is the only major country that doesn’t guarantee health care to everyone as a right. Sanders was a bit vague about which countries he was comparing to America, but his office clarified that he was thinking of the group that belongs to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Among the wealthy OECD nations, America stands out as the only one that lacks universal coverage. Mexico also has not achieved universal coverage, but Mexico is also a much poorer country and not always considered an industrialized or advanced economy. As for a guaranteed right to health care, Sanders spoke as though every advanced economy had it. In reality, some do and some don’t. He should have talked about universal coverage, but he didn’t. Sanders’ statement lacked some much needed clarity. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2015-06-29T17:49:44	2015-06-28	['None']
pomt-02042	Says he never wanted to raise the debt ceiling.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/02/mike-collins/candidates-debt-ceiling-defense-turns-troublesome/	Mike Collins says some folks don’t have their facts right concerning his position on one issue. His critics say he’s talking out of both sides of his mouth and "already acting like a Washington politician." Collins, a Republican candidate in Georgia’s 10th Congressional District race, is trying to explain some remarks he made six months ago about his position on whether to raise the federal debt ceiling. In a December interview with Roll Call, a news site that extensively reports about the ways of Washington, Collins offered a 15-second clip concerning his thoughts about the proposed debt- ceiling increase that Congress approved in February. "I think we need to raise the debt ceiling at a certain point that we can get business done and start working on a budget to start paying that down and get this economy back rolling," he said. A few days before the May 20 Republican primary, Collins put together a flier in response to criticism about what he said in the interview. Collins said, in part, that he "has never said he wanted to raise the debt ceiling." Is this a contradiction with Collins’ Roll Call interview? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Collins was one of seven Republicans vying for the House seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens. Broun ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Collins finished a very close second in the May 20 primary and is in a runoff in July with Jody Hice for the GOP nomination. The winner will face Democrat Kenneth Dious in the November general election. Collins is the son of former U.S. Rep. Mac Collins. Raising the debt ceiling was not a popular position among most conservatives. The U.S. Treasury Department said the United States would reach its borrowing limit by the end of February. Broun, like every other Republican House member from Georgia, voted against raising the debt ceiling. At least one of Collins’ opponents thought his remarks in the Roll Call interview could mean trouble for him. Less than a week before the primary, candidate Donna Sheldon posted the Collins interview on YouTube. "Mike Collins couldn't be more wrong about raising the debt limit. I will refuse to raise the debt ceiling, and I will fight to cut spending and balance our budget," she wrote. "Elections have consequences. Which position do you think is right for Georgia?" Collins responded with his flier. "Fact: Mike has never said he wanted to raise the debt ceiling and will never say he wants to raise the debt ceiling. He had the first written plan to reduce the debt." Sheldon accused Collins in a press release of "a whopper of a provable untruth." Collins said in a telephone interview with us that he never said he wanted to raise the debt ceiling. "The debt ceiling was going up whether or not I wanted it to," he said. "Did I want to (raise the debt ceiling)? No. We have to have a plan to start bringing it down." Collins explained in more detail a few days later via email. The candidate said he was not in favor of the legislation that passed to raise the debt ceiling in February. Collins said he would only support a debt-ceiling increase with "deep spending concessions and a path to pay the debt down." In November, Collins articulated his position on many issues on his campaign website. On federal spending, Collins wrote: "I am the only business professional in this race, and will work to ensure Congress passes an annual budget without raising the debt limit." In January, Collins put together a written plan that said "our national debt is out of control" and Congress needs to pass a balanced budget amendment. Collins wrote that he would support a budget plan similar to those proposed by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that would cut federal spending by $5 trillion over the next decade. "Saying that I want to raise the debt ceiling, implying that I support increasing our debt willy-nilly, is a false representation of what I believe, and I don’t think it’s a fair characterization of my stance on the issue," Collins said. In a follow-up telephone interview, Collins said the questions in the Roll Call interview came in rapid fire, and he conceded "I could have given a more detailed answer." To sum up, Collins said in an interview in December that he thought the debt ceiling needed to be increased when it was scheduled to reach its limit in February. Collins recently sent a flier claiming that he "has never said he wanted to raise the debt ceiling." Collins said his position was that he would only support a debt-ceiling increase in accordance with deep spending cuts. The debt-ceiling bill that passed in February did not include spending cuts. A month before the Roll Call interview, Collins had written that he would work to pass a budget without raising the debt ceiling. Collins said in one interview with PolitiFact Georgia that he could have given a more detailed answer in the Roll Call interview. Collins also could have been more detailed in the flier he sent out to defend himself. He might not have meant what he said, but his opponents have a point. He did say it. Our team had a lot of debate about this one. We believe Collins is somewhat accurate, but the claim in his flier omits some critical facts. Under our rating system, we rate Collins’ claim as Mostly False.	None	Mike Collins	None	None	None	2014-06-02T06:00:00	2014-05-16	['None']
pomt-06965	Says Texas is the only state that exempts jet fuel from its state motor fuels tax.	false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/15/eddie-rodriguez/eddie-rodriguez-says-texas-only-state-exempts-jet-/	Speaking to the tightened state budget passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature, state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez said outnumbered Democrats tried to illuminate tax loopholes and exemptions that, if closed, would yield badly needed state revenue. The Austin Democrat told the Central Texas Democratic Forum on June 22: "You all would be very, very surprised to know what we exempt in the state of Texas." For example, he said, "jet fuel is exempt. We are the only state, I think, that exempts that." For real? Rodriguez’s chief of staff, Nate Walker, later said Rodriguez was referring to the fact Texas does not levy a motor fuels tax on jet fuel. Indeed, R.J. DeSilva, spokesman for the state comptroller’s office, pointed us to sections of the motor fuels tax code that exempt all gas for aircraft delivered into or sold from a storage facility of a licensed aviation fuel dealer from the state’s gas or motor fuels tax. A February report by State Comptroller Susan Combs pegs the value of the gas tax exemption for aviation at $4.5 million for the fiscal year that ends Aug. 31. DeSilva said the value of the exemption for diesel fuel used in airplanes is not calculated. DeSilva said he didn’t know if Texas is the only state with such provisions. Researching that aspect, we turned to the Washington-based Federation of Tax Administrators, which guided us to the Maryland-based Airline Owners and Pilots Association, which pointed us to a Phoenix expert on aviation costs. Nel Stubbs of Conklin & de Decker, which describes itself as enabling customers to make more informed decisions when dealing with the purchase and operation of aircraft, told us by email that Texas and three other states — Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island — exempt jet fuel from their respective motor fuels taxes. Other states, she said, refund some or all of an airline’s motor fuels’ tax payments. Stubbs defined jet fuel as a type of aviation fuel designed for aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines. Rodriguez’s office, which we alerted to Stubbs’ analysis, passed along a 2008 report by Stubbs illuminating variations in jet-fuel taxation. California, for instance, levies a jet-fuel tax of two cents per gallon, though airlines are exempt. Similarly, commercial aircraft may qualify for partial exemptions from Florida’s tax of 6.9 cents per gallon, according to the report, while airlines fueling in New York are entitled to refunds of their payments of 6.5 cents a gallon. Stubbs, saying she’s tracked state-by-state differences since the late 1980s, added in an interview: "We’re 50 little kingdoms out there. You can never say, ‘We’re the only state that does this,’ because you’d be wrong. You can never say, ‘All states do something (either).’ They’re all different." Finally, she forwarded a chart showing variations in tax methods showing too that 11 states charge a sales tax, yet no motor fuels tax, on jet fuel. We circled back to Rodriguez, who said he had assumed Texas was the only state that doesn’t levy the motor fuels tax on jet fuel because the exemption struck him as weird. Besides, he reminded, Texas still is one of the few states with the exemption. We rate his statement False.	None	Eddie Rodriguez	None	None	None	2011-07-15T06:00:00	2011-06-22	['None']

"BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi to resign after new revelations," read the headline on NrtOnline, a website that claims to provide unique business news. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The post is not based in fact. First, a relatively minor point: The article referred to Pelosi, D-Calif., as the Senate majority leader when she is actually the House minority leader. The reported "revelations" are salacious but made up, saying Pelosi is accused of "unwanted advances" toward several staffers. The article claims that Senate insiders told military publication Army Times that there may soon be an opening for a new Minority Leader because of the suggested allegations. However, we didn’t find any articles from the Army Times regarding this information. According to the fake news article, the allegations consist of at least five men and one woman complaining about Pelosi previously making unwanted advances that got swept under the rug. NrtOnline cited the right-wing publication Breitbart for breaking this news, but we found no reports by Breitbart regarding this story, either. The story includes more fictional details about cash payments and promotions, but they aren’t worth repeating. We found no evidence by credible news outlets or other sources regarding the truth behind this story. Pelosi’s office also confirmed that she is not resigning and that nothing in the story is accurate. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-04814	"Thirty percent of [Sheldon Whitehouse' campaign] money is coming from special interests."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/19/barry-hinckley/us-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says-incumbent-/	U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, has been making headlines in the last month pushing for Senate passage of the DISCLOSE Act, which would -- with some exceptions -- require special-interest groups to reveal the identities of their large donors. His Republican opponent, Barry Hinckley, has criticized Whitehouse, saying it's hypocritical to rail against the influence of special-interest groups such as political action committees (PACs) while taking their money. During a news conference in front of Whitehouse's Providence office, Hinckley wondered aloud "how someone can take $2 million from the special interests when he's crying out against special-interest money in politics?" "I agree [that] special-interest money is polluting politics," Hinckley said. "Thirty percent of his money is coming from special interests. I've taken 1 percent." We wondered if the 30-percent figure was accurate. Hinckley’s campaign told The Journal that the percentage came from OpenSecrets.org, the website of the nonprofit nonpartisan Center for Responsible Politics, which tracks political donations. We checked the website. It lists Whitehouse as getting 29 percent of the $4.3 million he has raised for the current campaign from political action committees. That's where Hinckley got his figure. But Hinckley said 30 percent is special-interest money, a category that includes more than just donations from PACs. Top officials from a variety of businesses, professionals (such as lawyers), labor unions and other groups also give money as individuals, hoping to foster their agendas. The Hinckley campaign knows this. It released a YouTube video in conjunction with the news conference, citing examples of "Special Interest Money Given to Sheldon Whitehouse." The amounts in that ad total $4 million, not $2 million. But defining special-interest money isn't easy. Under federal law, anyone who gives more than $200 in a federal race is asked to reveal his or her occupation and employer. OpenSecrets puts those donations in various donor categories, listed by "industry." According to the website, during Whitehouse's two Senate runs, he has collected more than $1.5 million from the "lawyers and law firms" industry; 91 percent of that money came from individuals. It's impossible to know which individual donors were pushing an agenda and which donors simply thought that Whitehouse, a fellow attorney, was a great guy to give money to. Robert Biersack, senior fellow with the Center for Responsive Politics, argued that virtually all campaign donations might be considered special-interest money. Only a tiny fraction of the public contributes to political campaigns and, he said, even with a small donor, "they're looking for some policy outcome" by supporting one particular candidate over another. "It may not be on an economic question. It may be on a social issue. And the opportunity to get the ear of a member of the Senate is a pretty helpful thing whatever interest you may be pursuing." Wendy Schiller, a professor of political science and public policy at Brown University, had a slightly less-strict assessment, saying that leeway should be given to smaller donors. "Most, if not all, campaign money comes from special interests," including large donations from people who say they are retired, she said. "I think anything over $250 is more orchestrated and typically more professional," she said. So how much special-interest money has Whitehouse been getting? If you want to think of all PAC and large donations ($200 or more according to the way the feds classify them) as being special-interest money, 84 percent of the $4.3 million Whitehouse has raised for his campaign committee has come from special interests. (For Hinckley, it's 78 percent of the $1 million he has raised.) Alternatively, OpenSecrets categorizes all donations of $200 or more -- from PACs and individuals -- by "industry" and lists the top 20. Overall, as of June 30, 2012, Whitehouse had raised $4.3 million for his campaign committee. His top 20 "industries" gave him $3.1 million, or 72 percent. If all of that is special-interest money, that's much more than 30 percent. (The vast majority of the money -- 89 percent -- came from individuals.) That percentage could be higher because the list doesn't include smaller industry-related donations and some donations couldn't be placed into an "industry" category by OpenSecrets. The percentage could be lower if some of the donors don't have a special-interest agenda. But there's no way to determine that. Our ruling Republican Senate candidate Barry Hinckley said, "30 percent of [Sheldon Whitehouse's campaign] money is coming from special interests." If Hinckley was referring exclusively to political action committees, we would rate his statement True. But "special-interest group" is a broader -- if ill-defined -- category that includes lots of individual donors. By one rough estimate the amount could be 84 percent. By an even rougher estimate it could be 72 percent. Hinckley's 30 percent figure is way off the mark, which makes him ineligible for a True reading on the Truth-O-Meter. But our judges felt that, in this case, the data back up his point that Whitehouse is getting a significant amount of money from special interests. We will note, for the record, that while Hinckley is saying he has only gotten 1 percent of his money from special interests, the fact that 78 percent of his funds come from larger donors (not much different from Whitehouse's 84 percent) argues otherwise. A list of his donors by industry, we suspect, would also show a significant special-interest pattern, based on how Hinckley's campaign is defining special-interest money. However, OpenSecrets has not complied that list for Hinckley's donors because it doesn't have the resources to do every challenger, according to the organization. Because his statement has a significant element of truth but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-10974	Says Adam Putnam "backed a water bill that gutted water quality regulations."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/jul/18/democratic-governors-association/did-adam-putnam-endorse-bill-gutted-water-quality-/	The toxic green algae bloom spreading across Lake Okeechobee has seeped into the state’s political races, including Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam's quest for Florida governor. The Democratic Governors Association slammed Putnam, a Republican, in a July 10 press release, saying he cheered on weakened water quality regulations and lax oversight that they say contributed to the mess in Lake Okeechobee. The Democrats further pushed the point on "Algae Adam" in a Medium post-July 13: "As Agriculture Commissioner, Putnam backed a water bill that gutted water quality regulations." Did Putnam back a bill that "gutted" water regulations, and what does that have to do with the toxic situation in Lake Okeechobee? Putnam backed a bill in 2016 that changed the oversight of water quality conditions across the state. Supporters of the measure say the law was crafted to try and reduce pollution and improve water quality. Environmentalists say the law ended up doing the opposite. What a bill did for water quality For years, pollutants such as fertilizers, pesticides and human and animal waste have been pumped into Florida’s springs and water resources. SB 552, signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott in 2016, came about as a way to address the pollution and over-pumping, including at Lake Okeechobee, though whether it helps the situation is debated. The measure, among other things, required the Department of Environmental Protection to define the standard for what counts as "harmful to the water resources;" revised Florida statutes so that there would be stricter requirements for certain sized wells; and required that water management districts adopt recovery and prevention policies. It also established water-flow levels for springs. The bill overwhelmingly passed both chambers of the Legislature with just two dissenting votes from House Democrats. Putnam did not have a vote, but he did vouch for the bill. (Putnam also supported a very similar piece of legislation, HB 7003, in 2015.) "This builds on Florida's strong tradition of water policy that dates back to the early '70s," Putnam told reporters at the time. "And it won't be the end. I think there are things we need to continue to do but in that march toward progress. This appears to be moving and I hope it goes all the way, unlike last year." One of the primary concerns with the new law is that it did not create clear-cut standards for water quality monitoring. Under the new law, polluting farms can meet standards by adhering to Best Management Practices, such as building fences to keep animals out waterways. But environmentalists said that there are steps the bill could have taken when it comes to monitoring these farms, like involving the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Instead of giving more power to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to cut back on pollution, the bill put more oversight into the hands of Putnam's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Environmentalists said this amounts to voluntary pollution control strategies, rather than the concrete monitoring program they wanted to see. This provision impacts Lake Okeechobee water quality because the algae bloom covering the lake is in part caused by excess nitrates in agricultural run-off. "The 2016 water bill did effectively ‘gut water regulations,’ " said Kimberly Mitchell, the executive director of the Everglades Trust. "Before that, water management districts were allowed to implement pollution controls more broadly." More than 100 environmental organizations and businesses wrote to legislators, outlining criticisms and proposing 13 amendments. As an example, they singled out a provision for monitoring consumptive water permits. The law requires consumptive use permits for pipes with an "inside diameter of 8 inches or more." Before this, utilities had to have a consumptive use permit for more pipes under 8 inches, too. Our ruling The Democratic Governors Association said Putnam "backed a water bill that gutted water quality regulations." There's no doubt that Putnam supported a bipartisan law that made changes to state water policy. But the group's attack ignores the regulations and procedures that remain in place.

pomt-02701	"Obamacare Medical Codes Confirm: Execution by Beheading To Be Implemented in America."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/02/blog-posting/bloggers-say-obamacare-coding-system-could-usher-b/	We’ve heard people give lots of reasons for opposing Obamacare. But until a reader sent us some Internet links recently, we hadn’t realized that one of the fears being spawned by Obamacare was that it could usher in legal beheadings across America. The reader pointed us to a variety of blog posts, such as one headlined, "Obamacare Medical Codes Confirm: Execution by Beheading To Be Implemented in America." As if this wasn’t scary enough, this post was accompanied by a photograph of a masked executioner swinging a curved sword downward, just inches from the neck of the condemned. What’s going on here? The idea appears to trace back to a Nov. 18, 2013, post by Lorri Anderson on the blog Freedom Outpost. Anderson’s piece was later reposted, excerpted or promoted uncritically on a range of other blogs. (It also received a thorough takedown by blogger David W. Thornton of the Atlanta Conservative Examiner.) Anderson cites a document known as ICD-9, which refers to the ninth update of the "International Classification of Diseases." ICD-9 is a lengthy list of medical conditions and causes of death published by the World Health Organization and used in the United States by medical professionals for billing purposes and by health statisticians who study causes of death. One of the categories in ICD-9 is this one: "Legal execution: All executions performed at the behest of the judiciary or ruling authority (whether permanent or temporary) as: asphyxiation by gas, beheading, decapitation (by guillotine), capital punishment, electrocution, hanging, poisoning, shooting, other specified means." Anderson wrote that the connection between the coding system, Obamacare and legal execution would "make any American’s hair stand up on the back of their neck." But if anything, subsequent posts on other websites destroyed any nuances she included. One even accompanied a blog post with a drawing of Uncle Sam with his head in a guillotine. The WHO’s coding system Here’s the reality about what the World Health Organization’s coding system does and doesn’t do. As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check, the United States medical system currently uses ICD-9 and is in the process of transitioning to ICD-10. Doctors’ offices use the codes to fill out Medicare and Medicaid claims, among other things. Their billing and practice management software is based on them. Their employees are trained to use them. The transition to ICD-10 is somewhat controversial, though not because of beheading. The American Medical Association says that depending on the size of the medical practice, it’ll cost $83,290 to more than $2.7 million to switch. Doctors are dealing with so many other expensive regulatory changes, the association has begged since 2011 to delay or give up on the switch altogether. But the federal government is requiring American doctors, and any organization covered by the 1996 health care law known as HIPAA, to switch to ICD-10 by Oct. 1, 2014. That’s because because ICD-9 has outdated medical terms and not enough detail for accurate claims processing, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In fact, the rest of the world began switching to the new codes 20 years ago, and now most developed countries now use it. Why Obamacare isn’t implementing beheading So one can make a reasoned argument over details of how, or whether, the United States should transition to the new coding system. But the possibility of beheadings is just scare talk. Here are some of the problems: • A doctor can’t bill an insurer for a beheading. Obamacare -- a program that addresses health care for the living -- doesn’t have anything to do with beheading. The "beheading" category in the code is for the purposes of compiling death statistics, something the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention handles. The CDC uses the codes to make apples-to-apples comparisons with other countries. "These coding rules improve the usefulness of mortality statistics by giving preference to certain categories, by consolidating conditions, and by systematically selecting a single cause of death from a reported sequence of conditions," the CDC says. • The "beheading" coding category long predates Obama. The coding for "beheading" has been standard in the U.S. since at least 1979, when the CDC adopted ICD-9 for the purposes of compiling death statistics. At that time, Obama was graduating high school. • There is no legal beheading in the United States today, and the president couldn’t change that even if he wanted to. The military uses only lethal injection, and the federal government essentially does as well. Lethal injections are also used in 35 states, with a dwindling number of states using electrocution, the gas chamber, hanging or a firing squad. Most of the methods other than lethal injection are secondary methods, either by choice or necessity. No state uses beheading. More importantly, as this summary makes clear, each state chooses its own method of execution, making the decision of what method to use beyond the reach for the federal government. The reason beheading is in the code at all is because it is a common method of execution in Saudi Arabia and some other countries, and is practiced by some militant and terrorist groups. So for an international coding system, beheading, for better or for worse, is needed. Our ruling Bloggers have recently offered posts headlined like this one: "Obamacare Medical Codes Confirm: Execution by Beheading To Be Implemented in America." But the coding system in question long predates Obama, and the "beheading" classification is only relevant for death statistics, not for insurance billing that would be under Obamacare’s purview. Finally, the beheading code is for statistical purposes, not for setting policy. Any change in legal execution methods would have to be approved by the states, not by the federal government.

pomt-07719	Says Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget "roadmap … doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and … adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt between now and then."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/03/matt-miller/matt-miller-blasts-deficit-debt-implications-paul-/	In a Feb. 24, 2011, column in the Washington Post, Matt Miller, a senior fellow with the liberal Center for American Progress, criticized Republican plans for the federal budget. Miller specifically took aim at a "roadmap" put forth by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the chairman of the House Budget Committee. "We're so accustomed to political flimflam that, as (the late Democratic Sen.) Daniel Patrick Moynihan might have put it, we're defining truth-telling down," Miller wrote. He charged that leading Republicans have so far only offered "half-truths" about the long-term budget realities. "Thanks to House budget chief Paul Ryan, it's possible to measure the size of this fraud. And it's colossal," Miller wrote. "As can never be said often enough, Ryan is absurdly hailed as a fiscal ‘conservative’ for a ‘roadmap’ that doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and that adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt between now and then." Miller said that Ryan "pretends we can keep federal taxes at their recent historic levels of 19 percent of gross domestic product as the boomers age. No can do. The math doesn't work. Ryan's endless red ink proves this." As Congressional leaders and the White House negotiate over the next federal budget, we thought we’d check whether Miller fairly characterizes Ryan’s proposal -- specifically whether it’s true that Ryan’s roadmap "doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and … adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt." First, we turned to Ryan’s roadmap itself. In a summary table, Ryan provided the amounts for outlays, revenues, deficits or surpluses, and debt for every year of the plan through 2083. (Yes, through 2083 -- more on that in a moment.) Ryan’s table offers these figures as a percentage of gross domestic product rather than as dollar amounts. For the question of when the budget reaches balance, Miller is correct. The percentage of GDP shifts from negative (representing a deficit) to positive (a surplus) in 2063. From that point on, the percentage stays in positive territory -- that is, in surplus -- through 2083. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’s non-partisan arbiter of budgetary figures -- doesn’t list the exact year that surpluses first occur under Ryan’s plan, but it agrees that it will happen sometime between 2060 and 2080. So on this point Miller appears to be correct. How about Miller’s claim that Ryan would add $62 trillion to the debt? We couldn’t find a $62 trillion figure in either Ryan’s roadmap or in the CBO analysis. We looked back at a previous column and discovered that Miller had also mentioned the figure there. Here’s what he wrote: "According to the Congressional Budget Office, Ryan's plan would result in annual deficits of between 3.5 and 4.5 percent of GDP between now and somewhere after 2040, with a balanced budget coming only around 2063," Miller wrote. "This would add at least $62 trillion to the national debt over the period. (My estimate is conservative mostly because the independent Tax Policy Center says Ryan's tax reforms would produce far less revenue than Ryan required the CBO to assume.)" In other words, the $62 trillion figure is an estimate that Miller -- not Ryan or CBO -- produced, and it doesn’t cover the debt added by Ryan’s plan through either 2080 (the final year of CBO’s analysis) or 2083 (the final year of Ryan’s projection). Miller told PolitiFact that his $62 trillion estimate was conservative, stopping the count at 2050 rather than the deficit/surplus tipping point of 2063, and using lower annual debt estimates than CBO did. Whether or not Miller's figure is right -- and the number is certainly in the trillions of dollars -- it's important to note that he was selective in choosing his time frame. That’s because between 2063 and 2080, the federal debt under Ryan’s plan is projected to disappear. In fact, by 2083, the debt under Ryan’s plan would actually turn into a surplus -- a surplus equal to one-sixth of the nation’s GDP. These numbers come from Ryan’s proposal, but CBO’s analysis essentially backs them up, agreeing that the national debt would fall to between negative 0.5 percent and positive 0.5 percent of GDP in 2080. In other words, CBO reckons that the debt would be either small, zero, or in a modest surplus by then. So while Miller has a point that it would take Ryan 52 years to balance the budget -- and that perhaps trillions of dollars in debt will be added between now and then -- the columnist leaves out the counterpoint that Ryan’s plan would eliminate the federal debt after an additional 17 to 20 years. There’s also another bit of missing context: Under the status quo, it would take even longer to reach a surplus, and the U.S. would acquire even more debt. There aren’t many budgetary projections that look 69 years into the future. But CBO does produce long-term budget analyses, including one under a scenario in which the current baseline budget numbers are adjusted to include changes to those policies that are widely expected to be enacted. Under this status-quo scenario, CBO sees the deficit growing consistently as a percentage of GDP, from 7.4 percent of GDP in 2020 to 17.2 percent in 2040, 28 percent in 2060 and 42.8 percent in 2080. So under this model there isn’t a surplus in sight at all, at least through 2080. As for debt, the situation is similar. According to CBO, the status-quo model produces debt levels that reach 433 percent of GDP by 2060 and 716 percent of GDP by 2080. The comparable numbers for Ryan’s plan are 77 percent of GDP by 2060 and essentially zero by 2080. By glossing over what happens to the debt under Ryan’s plan between 2063 and 2083, Miller does give a misleading impression of its projected full fiscal impact. Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, calls Miller’s debt assertion "ridiculous. Yes, Ryan's plan may allow $62 trillion of debt, but that is far, far, far less than what would happen under current law." But Miller makes two counter-arguments. First, Miller isn’t advocating the status-quo plan CBO used. To the contrary, his point is that while some of Ryan’s proposed policies are admirable, the lawmaker should be more aggressive about deficits and the debt by proposing tax increases. Such increases, which are anathema to most Republicans, could help reduce the deficit and the debt much more quickly than Ryan’s plan would. Second, 70-year budgetary estimates ought to be taken with a big grain of salt. On the one hand, economists use the tools they have available, and because much of the federal budget is dictated by long-term demographics -- including Social Security and Medicare -- experts in the field say that the numbers are reasonable approximations. Still, 2083 is as long in the future as 1939 is in the past. Any estimates made in 1939 about what the nation’s economy would look like in 2011 would not have accounted for factors that were unimaginable then, from the baby boom to free trade policies to computerization and the Internet. "Ryan is the one who claims his plan is ‘conservative,’" Miller told PolitiFact. "The idea that he runs 62 or 80 or 100 trillion in debt but then pledges to do better when all of us are long dead is silly." So where does this leave us? On the one hand, Miller’s statement fails to mention the fact that Ryan’s plan does eventually eliminate the debt, according to CBO -- a sizable achievement when one realizes that under status quo policies, the debt would be more than seven times the size of the nation’s economy. Still, an outcome 70 years from now is subject to a lot of uncertainty, and Miller’s actual statement was phrased carefully. It’s true, as he says, that Ryan’s plan "doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s," and before it gets there, it will probably add trillions of dollars in debt. It’s a close call, but we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Matt Miller	None	None	None	2011-03-03T14:19:24	2011-02-24	['None']
pomt-06838	"When Nancy Nusbaum was Brown County executive, spending went up nearly 50 percent."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/05/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wisconsin-manufacturers-commerce-says-brown-county/	As she campaigns to upend GOP state Sen. Robert Cowles in one of the closely watched Wisconsin recall campaigns, Democrat Nancy Nusbaum is talking up her long record of public service. Now an ally of Cowles, the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, is trying to use that record against Nusbaum. In a television ad paid for by its issues fund, the heavyweight business group is ripping Nusbaum’s fiscal record during her eight years as Brown County executive, which ended in 2003. "Spending went up, taxes went up," the ad says in part. "Everything Nancy Nusbaum touches goes up. When Nusbaum was Brown County executive, spending went up nearly 50 percent. Tell Nancy Nusbaum we expect fiscal responsibility to be real, not a lot of hot air." In the ad, hot air balloons and rockets rise to underline the point. When we sought backup from WMC, the group did not return calls. So we checked the record. Brown County officials looked up the budget numbers for us, focusing on the seven budgets Nusbaum signed from late 1995 to early 2003. Operating spending went up 53 percent over those seven years. That works out to an average increase of 6.3 percent per year. State, local and federal funds contribute to the budget. So the ad is on target numerically. Indeed, Nusbaum does not dispute the numbers in it and did not criticize the ad as unfair but noted the County Board had a role in the budgets. By contrast, the spending increase over the seven years following Nusbaum’s tenure was 34 percent, which is 4.2 percent per year on average. The ad pulls the statistic out without any context for what was behind it. Why the dramatic difference in spending? Nusbaum pointed to replacement of an overcrowded jail, the cost of state-mandated services, increasing urbanization and associated social service costs, and the costs of caring for an aging population, among other reasons. Property values and state aid to counties were rising, welfare and jail spending grew rapidly, and counties saw big increases in administrative costs for things such as information technology, said John Reinemann, legislative director for the Wisconsin Counties Association. Levy limits on counties were minimal compared with today, Reinemann noted. Reinemann told us that 7 percent to 8 percent annual spending increases such as those in Brown County were not uncommon in the late 1990s among Wisconsin counties. His view is backed up by a ranking of counties that shows Brown in the middle of the pack in growth of spending per capita from 1993-2001. That is from the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization. Spending in six key categories went up 6.3 percent annually during that time, the group found. Nusbaum, a retired teacher and former mayor of De Pere, said she prefers to point to the property tax rate instead of the total tax levy and kept it stable as executive. Brown County records show she did that. But the rate does not reflect the true cost of government, especially when it comes to property taxes. The rate can stay steady or decline, but tax bills can rise if the property tax levy (an indicator of spending) goes up. In Brown County, as elsewhere, increasing property values in the 1990s helped hold down the tax rate even as total tax levy collections rose. Statewide values jumped up 7.7 percent a year from 1993-2002, WTA found. In fact, statewide, net property tax rates actually dropped during the decade as property values soared. Let’s conclude. A business group spotlighted the budget increases during Nusbaum’s term, suggesting through words and graphics that they were sky high. They certainly were large compared with the years that followed, for reasons related to decisions by Nusbaum, county supervisors, the state, and local residents -- as well as demographics and sociological trends. The number -- 50 percent -- is on target. But the ad leaves out information about the other factors that went into the spending. Indeed, Brown County’s spending was not atypical for the time and by at least one group’s measure was in the middle of the pack. We rate the WMC claim Mostly True.

pomt-03154	"CBO reports that delaying the Obamacare individual mandate will reduce the deficit by $35 billion over ten years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/09/grover-norquist/grover-norquist-says-delaying-obamacare-year-would/	Grover Norquist, who heads the conservative, anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform, is no fan of President Barack Obama’s health care law. In a tweet sent on Sept. 8, 2013, Norquist cites research by the Congressional Budget Office -- the independent budget-analysis arm of Congress -- to quantify how much money the federal government could save by delaying some of the health care law’s key provisions. "CBO reports that delaying the Obamacare individual mandate will reduce the deficit by $35 billion over 10 years. Another good reason," Norquist tweeted. Is Norquist right? The tweet refers to a CBO analysis released on Sept. 6, 2013. The agency looked at the potential impact on the federal budget if a bill that has already passed the House were to become law. The bill includes a one-year delay of the start of the requirement that individuals secure health insurance coverage, as well as a similar delay of the tax penalties assessed for not complying with that "individual mandate." (The bill would also delay by a year the imposition of penalties on employers who do not offer health insurance, though the Obama administration has already implemented that change, so we will not focus on that provision in this article.) The measure passed the House on July 17 by a 264-161 vote, with a minority of Democrats -- 35 in all -- siding with all but one of the Republicans who voted to support the bill. It now awaits action in the Senate, though that is considered unlikely since the Senate is controlled by the Democrats. CBO determined that over 10 years -- its typical time frame from analyzing the fiscal impact of bills -- passing the measure would save $35.4 billion. Here’s where the bulk of that money comes from (a small share comes from other areas): • Fewer uninsured Americans signing up for government health care programs such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, because the mandate wouldn’t be pushing people to do so. Savings: $16.9 billion over 10 years. • Fewer uninsured Americans receiving federal subsidies designed to help them purchase plans on the law’s insurance marketplace. Savings: $8.9 billion over 10 years. • More Americans receiving cash in their paychecks (which is taxable) rather than health insurance (which is not taxable), balanced by the absence of collections of tax penalties for non-compliance. Additional tax revenues, on balance: $7.4 billion over 10 years. So Norquist has cited the number accurately. However, it’s worth noting a few other things CBO said that didn’t make it into the tweet. First, this boon to the federal treasury comes at a cost. CBO said that passage of the law would increase the number of people without health insurance by about 11 million in 2014, compared to what CBO estimated Obama’s law would accomplish if it remained intact. Second, Norquist correctly states that the $35 billion figure refers to cumulative savings over 10 years. However, it’s worth noting that the bulk of that savings -- 58 percent -- comes in 2014, and 87 percent comes in either 2014 or 2015. In other words, the benefit to the federal treasury is mostly a one-time event; the bill wouldn't cancel a program permanently, only delay spending for a year. So, passing the bill would not produce an ongoing stream of revenue or savings to the Treasury, since many of the people who aren't compelled to buy insurance in 2014 (or taxed for not buying it) will be shelling out for either an insurance plan or a tax penalty once the delayed requirements take effect. Our ruling Norquist said, "CBO reports that delaying the Obamacare individual mandate will reduce the deficit by $35 billion over 10 years." Norquist accurately reported the amount CBO estimated. However, his tweet cherry picks CBO’s conclusions, ignoring that the bill would produce 11 million additional uninsured Americans, and that the savings would amount to a one-time fiscal event. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-04278	Says Mitt Romney "was director of a company that stole millions from Medicare."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/nov/02/priorities-usa-action/mitt-romney-and-rick-scott-both-have-medicare-frau/	The super PAC supporting President Barack Obama made a final pitch to Florida voters before Election Day: a TV ad comparing Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Gov. Rick Scott. Showing a picture of the two men locked in a handshake, the ad urges viewers to "connect the dots." "Scott ran a company that paid a record fine for committing Medicare fraud, then as governor Scott cut millions from health care," a narrator says. "Romney was director of a company that stole millions from Medicare. Now Romney’s plan would end Medicare as we know it. "We’ve seen this picture before. Just connect the dots: If Mitt Romney wins, the middle class loses." PolitiFact has investigated claims against both Scott and Romney about Medicare fraud during their business careers. Here’s a look at what we found. ‘Scott ran a company that paid a record fine for committing Medicare fraud’ In the spring of 1987, Scott purchased two Texas hospitals to start a company first known as Columbia. He quickly grew the company by purchasing more hospitals to create a large and profitable network. In 1994, Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. Columbia/HCA grew to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations, employing more than 285,000 people. Scott resigned as chief executive officer in 1997, the year that federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. In time, it became apparent that the investigation focused on whether Columbia/HCA bilked Medicare and Medicaid for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians, and for attaching false diagnosis codes to patient records to increase reimbursement to the hospitals. Scott resigned as CEO in July, less than four months after the inquiry became public. Company executives said that if Scott had remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy. At issue, Scott said, was that he wanted to fight the federal government accusations. The corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle. And settle Columbia/HCA did. In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced what it called the largest government fraud settlement in U.S. history when Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement, which all apply to when Scott was CEO, were that Columbia overbilled Medicare for unnecessary tests and false diagnosis codes. The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total fine: $1.7 billion. As part of the 2000 settlement, Columbia/HCA agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. A corporate felony comes with financial penalties but not jail time, since a corporation can’t be sent to prison. Scott himself was never indicted. ‘Romney was director of a company that stole millions from Medicare’ Romney’s record at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded, came up frequently during the Republican primary. This claim refers to Bain’s history with a company charged with Medicare fraud in the 1990s. The Boston media investigated the facts of the case when Romney ran for governor in 2002. It’s also addressed in The Real Romney, a biography by reporters with the Boston Globe. The story begins in 1989, when Romney was the head of Bain Capital, which specialized in buying troubled companies, turning them around, and then selling them for a profit. That year, Bain invested in Damon Corp., a medical testing company based in Needham, Mass. Bain took the company public in 1991, and Romney served on the company’s board of directors. In 1993, Bain orchestrated a sale of the company to Corning Inc., getting a handsome return on its investment and earning Romney himself $473,000, according to The Real Romney. After the sale, Corning closed the main facility in Needham, laying off 115 people. In October 1996, federal prosecutors announced that Damon was agreeing to pay $119 million in both civil and criminal fines after pleading guilty to defrauding Medicare. The company was providing doctors with forms that didn’t make clear what tests included, so doctors were checking off additional tests that weren’t necessary, according to the Globe’s summary of the government’s case. The overbilling went from 1988 through 1993, prosecutors said. "This is a case, pure and simple, of corporate greed run amok," U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said when the settlement was announced. Romney was never implicated in the case. He claimed that he helped uncover the fraud, but Globe reporting put that claim into question. The Globe reported that court records showed fraudulent activity occurred under Bain’s watch, and that prosecutors gave the credit to Corning for stopping the fraud. The Romney campaign, though, pointed us to Globe stories noting that Bain officials began investigating the billing practices when a competitor lab pleaded guilty to the same type of fraud. The campaign also emphasized that Bain was never a majority owner in Damon -- its ownership share peaked at 8 percent and was just 2.8 percent went the company sold to Corning. Are Romney and Scott’s cases similar? By telling viewers to "connect the dots" between Romney and Scott, the Priorities ad implies that the Medicare fraud cases in their pasts are parallel. But in some important ways, the cases are different. Scott was the top boss at Columbia/HCA during the years prosecutors found fraudulent activity, and his role as the face of the company is undisputed. Romney’s position at Damon Corp. is a different story. As a member of the board of directors, Romney had a part in overseeing the company’s general direction. That’s not like being the CEO, who directs day-to-day activities. The ad muddies that fact -- and it’s misleading to say Romney served as "director" of Damon Corp., not "a director." Also, Columbia/HCA faced much larger fines and penalties than Damon did -- $1.7 billion versus $119 million. Our ruling The Priorities ad says Romney "was director of a company that stole millions from Medicare," comparing him with Scott. Scott’s hospital company, Columbia/HCA, pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid a total of $1.7 billion in fines related to Medicare fraud. Even though Scott had resigned by the time the case settled, prosecutors said the widespread fraud occurred while he was at the helm. But the fraud case at Damon Corp. doesn’t point straight to Romney. His firm bought the company that was later found guilty of fraud, but Romney was not running the show while crimes were being committed. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. That fits our definition of Mostly True.	None	Priorities USA Action	None	None	None	2012-11-02T17:26:02	2012-10-31	['None']
pomt-09488	The CBO found that the House Republican health care plan would lower premiums by "up to about 10 percent" and, for purchasers in the individual market, "those cost savings could even be higher."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/25/charles-boustany/boustany-says-gop-health-plan-would-lower-premiums/	One of the recurring debates in the Feb. 25, 2010, health care summit at Blair House dealt with how Democratic and Republican reform proposals would affect the cost of health premiums. Here we'll take a look at the House Republican proposal. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., one of the House Republican delegates to the summit and a physician himself, used a portion of his time to tout his party's plan. "We put forth a plan earlier in the year, during the debate, that actually the Congressional Budget Office showed that it brings down the cost of premiums up to about 10 percent," he said to fellow summit participants. "And, actually, for individuals [and] families seeking insurance in the individual market, those cost savings could even be higher." Before we analyze Boustany's comment, let's take a look at the House Republican proposal, which, due to the Republican minority's lack of institutional power in the House, has garnered much less attention than its Democratic counterpart. A Democratic bill narrowly passed the chamber last fall. As we originally outlined in November, the Republicans produced a much smaller bill (219 pages vs. roughly 2,000 for the Democrats) and one with a more limited scope. It relies on GOP principles of consumer choice, no tax hikes, limited government involvement and caps on lawsuits. Here are some of the key provisions in the GOP proposal that are relevant to judging Boustany's statement: • More limited reach for the federal government. The GOP bill has no public option — that is, no government-run insurance program, or anything remotely like it. Nor does the GOP bill include an expansion of the federal-state Medicaid health insurance program for the poor. The House Democratic bill has both. The GOP plan also has no health care exchange, the government-run marketplace for people who are now uninsured. And consistent with Republican fears of government moving toward a system of deciding what treatments patients can receive, the GOP plan, unlike the Democratic bills, does not foster "comparative effectiveness" research that tries to determine which treatments are most effective. • Medical malpractice reform. Republicans have long sought to curb medical malpractice lawsuits, which they say needlessly raise health care costs. The Republican bill curbs malpractice lawsuits by capping noneconomic and punitive damages and making changes in the allocation of liability. The Democratic bill does not. • Favoring consumer choice over a guaranteed safety net and minimum benefits. The Republican plan would try to expand coverage and reduce costs voluntarily, primarily by increasing consumer options, rather than the Democratic method of using government leverage (such as mandates, penalties and subsidies) to corral more uninsured Americans into obtaining coverage. The Republican bill would allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, something that is currently not allowed, and would allow small businesses to pool insurance coverage through trade associations, an option only allowed for larger companies and labor unions today. The bill would also expand the use of health savings accounts, which allow people to use pre-tax dollars to pay medical expenses. None of these programs would be mandatory. • High-risk pools. The Republican bill would offer aid to states to establish "high-risk pools," groups of sicker (and thus more expensive) patients who typically have trouble finding insurance today because of restrictions on pre-existing conditions. It would also boost state-based reinsurance mechanisms that can help insurers that find it too costly to insure such pools. The Democratic bills use these pools, but only as a stopgap on the way to creating a new system. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress that analyzes legislation, took a detailed look at the Republican proposal when it was released. The figures Boustany cited in his Blair House comments come from this Nov. 4, 2009, analysis. The CBO projected that the cost of health insurance premiums would fall under the Republican plan, partly because of the medical malpractice reforms. In the market for individually purchased insurance policies -- "the individual market" -- premiums would fall by 5 percent to 8 percent by 2016. For the small-group pool, consisting of smaller businesses, premiums would fall by 7 percent to 10 percent. And in the large group market, for larger employers, they would fall by up to 3 percent. So when Boustany said that the CBO showed that the GOP bill would bring down the cost of premiums "up to about 10 percent," he's correct. Granted, he cherry-picked the number at the high end of the scale, but by couching it with the language "up to," it passes muster with us. Now we'll look at the second part of Boustany's statement -- that for "insurance in the individual market, those cost savings could even be higher." As indicated above, the CBO analysis concludes that the individual market could see premiums fall by 5 percent to 8 percent -- which is not a bigger drop than the 10 percent Boustany cited. So on this point he would seem to be incorrect. But we'll offer a caveat. CBO itself acknowledges that any exercise in projecting the future effects of a major policy change such as this one will be subject to uncertainty. In its study of the Republican proposal, the CBO acknowledged that some "individuals and families within each market would see reductions in premiums that would be larger or smaller than the estimated average reductions, and some people would see increases." This means that, in some cases, Boustany will be correct that "for individuals [and] families seeking insurance in the individual market, those cost savings could even be higher" than 10 percent. When we contacted Boustany's office, a spokesman argued that this caveat makes the statement true, given the congressman's use of the word "could." “Rep. Boustany highlighted CBO’s analysis that the House Republican plan would likely lower premiums by 10 percent, and could be even more," wrote press secretary Rick Curtsinger in an e-mail. We take his point, but we still think this part of Boustany's comment is somewhat misleading. CBO acknowledges that savings above 10 percent could happen for those in the individual market, but the agency's best estimate is that the reductions will be generally smaller than 8 percent, much less 10 percent. We find this Mostly True.	None	Charles Boustany	None	None	None	2010-02-25T18:25:45	2010-02-25	['Congressional_Budget_Office', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-07555	Says Majority Leader Eric Cantor called for "abolishing Social Security and Medicare."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/01/americans-united-change/americans-united-change-says-eric-cantor-wants-abo/	House Majority Leader Eric Cantor set off a feeding frenzy on the left when he made a statement at the Hoover Institution on March 21, 2011, that seemed to suggest he wants to abolish entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. The statement in question came during a discussion of the need to reform entitlement programs. Said Cantor: "We're going to have to come to grips with the fact that these programs cannot exist if we want America to be what we want America to be." The quote shot around the liberal blogosphere and was circulated in a statement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats, with dire warnings about Republicans finally revealing their true intentions for Social Security and Medicare. On March 31, 2011, the liberal groups Americans United for Change and the group Strengthen Social Security put out a press release titled, "U.S. Rep. Schakowsky, Leading Seniors Advocates: Will Republicans in Congress Condemn House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s Outrageous Calls for Abolishing Social Security and Medicare?" The release calls on Republicans in Congress to "denounce the radical, out-of-touch statements made by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., who said Social Security and Medicare 'cannot exist' for future generations." Later that morning, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., and the two groups held a teleconference with the media in which Schakowsky blasted Cantor's statement as "stunning" and "completely out of touch with where the American people are right now." Without Social Security, she said, 14 million seniors would fall into poverty. Abolishing Social Security and Medicare are pretty radical political ideas, but is that actually Cantor's position? One need only listen to Cantor's statements immediately before and after the quote seized on by Democrats to see that's not the case. Here's a fuller transcript of Cantor's statement at Hoover: "Our (entitlement) reforms are centered on the fact that you've got to protect today's seniors. "I mean, just from the very notion that it said that 50 percent of beneficiaries under the Social Security program use those monies as their sole source of income. So we've got to protect today's seniors. But for the rest of us? For -- you know, listen, we're going to have to come to grips with the fact that these programs cannot exist if we want America to be what we want America to be. "So, we're going to have to accept some changes as far as the rest of us. And what we're saying is for those 55 and older who do not have to worry about changes in benefits, but for the rest of us, we will. We will have to do that." So for starters, Cantor is saying that he does not intend to mess with the Social Security benefits for current retirees, or those nearing retirement. But what about those under 55? Cantor and other Republican leaders have been short on details. In his speech at Hoover, Cantor said that within three weeks, Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan will be unveiling a budget for the coming fiscal year that will include specifics on how the Republicans want to reform entitlement programs. In the past, Rep. Ryan has called for a plan that would allow workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government. As for Medicare, Ryan's plan again called for leaving Medicare benefits as they are for people over 55. But for those younger than 55, his proposal "creates a standard Medicare payment to be used for the purchase of private health coverage." Ryan's plan included a number of other Medicare changes as well. But Republican leaders never signed off on the Ryan plan, and it's unclear what the upcoming Republican budget plan will include. And while Cantor has has provided general support for Ryan's plan, he has not been clear about where he personally stands on the plan's specific proposals for Social Security and Medicare. But while Cantor isn't tipping his hand with many specifics, in recent public statements Cantor has talked about changing, but not abolishing entirely, the programs for those under 55. In an op-ed for Politico on Feb. 19, 2011, for example, Cantor wrote about the need to "rein in" entitlements. In an interview on CNBC on March 16, 2011, Cantor said the Republican plan will "protect today's seniors and those nearing retirement. But for those of us 54 and under, we're going to insist to go and deal with the fact that if these programs are going to be around, they're going to have to look a lot different. That's the plain and simple fact of it." "Looking a lot different" isn't the same as abolishing. Cantor spokeswoman Laena Fallon told PolitiFact via e-mail that the statements from Schakowsky and other Democrats and liberal groups are a deliberate distortion of his position. "People are entitled to their own opinions, but not to their own facts," Fallon said. "With all due respect, what the congresswoman is saying is simply untrue – Eric has made clear for months that he is committed to ensuring the long-term viability of these programs by addressing their solvency issues now. What's indisputable is that doing nothing – which seems to be the position of the president, his party's leaders, and Congresswoman Schakowsky – will ensure these programs remain on a path to bankruptcy, resulting in a debt-fueled economic crisis. We should be able to debate different solutions for preserving Social Security and Medicare for future generations based on intellectual honesty, not demagoguery and fear campaigns." Asked about Cantor's position on Medicare, Fallon said that Cantor "has been pretty clear that entitlement programs won't change for those 55 and above, but we must work to strengthen these programs so that they're around for future generations for those folks 54 and below." In a story about the Democratic furor over Cantor's statement, Brian Beutler of the liberal site Talking Points Memo wrote that there is "plenty of fodder for criticism" of Cantor's statement. "But it's pretty far-fetched to say Cantor proposed eliminating Social Security outright for people under age 55," Beutler wrote. A Cantor spokesman told TPM that Cantor simply misspoke in the Hoover address. And Fallon told us that, "Leader Cantor does not want to abolish Social Security and Medicare." But when asked in her teleconference about the possibility Cantor misspoke, Schakowsky wasn't buying it. "It might be some sort of Freudian slip where Eric Cantor showed everyone what he really thinks," Schakowsky said. "...I think the slip was that he said it out loud." In a press release, Tom McMahon, executive director, Americans United for Change, said, "This was no slip of the tongue. We’ve long since suspected Eric Cantor’s true intentions of going down a path towards abolishing Social Security and Medicare as we know them -- intentions that he may now regret saying out loud in public." In the release and the telephone news conference, Schkowsky and Americans United failed to provide any solid evidence that Cantor wants to abolish the programs. They have cherry-picked a portion of his comments to the Hoover Institution that his office says does not reflect his true position. Cantor has repeatedly said that entitlement program reform needs to be part of the national discussion -- a controversial enough idea on its own -- but his lack of detail about how that ought to happen leaves him open to speculative attacks. The fuller context of Cantor's statement at Hoover, together with statements he has made about Social Security and Medicare in other recent interviews, however, give no indication that he would like to abolish them. That fuller context suggests Cantor probably meant to say that Social Security and Medicare cannot exist as they are now. That's different. It was a linguistic misstep on a highly volatile issue, but the Democrats' reaction was a clear overreach. We rule the Americans United claim False.

pomt-14747	Says Ted Cruz supports "legalizing people who are in this country illegally."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/dec/16/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-ted-cruz-supports-legalizing-peop/	During the Republican debate in Las Vegas, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida accused one of his rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, of being soft on immigration policy. "Ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally," Rubio said. "Ted Cruz supported a 500 percent increase in the number of H1B visas, the guest workers that are allowed in this country. And Ted supports doubling the number of green cards." Cruz responded, "I understand that Marco wants to raise confusion. It is not accurate what he just said that I supported legalization. Indeed, I led the fight against his legalization and amnesty bill." When pressed by Rubio about whether he had ruled out legalization, Cruz said, "I have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization." That was a more clearly worded statement then many of Cruz’s past comments about legalization. Cruz’s immigration plan released in November called for increasing deportations of criminals but didn’t address how he would handle all 11 million illegally here and whether they would get legal status. However, Rubio’s statement that Cruz supports "legalizing people who are in this country illegally" is a head-snapper, since Cruz holds himself out as tougher than the rest of his rivals on giving ground to people living in the United States without legal authorization. Rubio was one of the eight senators who co-authored a bill in 2013 that created a path to citizenship. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House. We’ve noted before that Cruz was the only one among the GOP presidential field who never plainly supported something like a path to citizenship or another form of legal status. In September 2015, PolitiFact rated Mostly True Cruz’s claim that he alone among 10 candidates -- including Rubio -- never backed "amnesty" for immigrants. We’ll focus on whether Cruz supported legalization for illegal immigrants. (Rubio also said that Cruz supported more visas and green cards, but that’s not the same thing as legalizing people who are in the country illegally. We’ll leave the visa issue aside for now.) Much of the debate between Rubio and Cruz on this point revolves around an amendment Cruz offered to the 2013 bill to change immigration law -- and whether he truly intended that to provide legal status or proposed it as a legislative strategy without ever intending to support the bill anyway. Cruz’s statements about 2013 bill Let’s start by walking through what Cruz has proposed over the years about legal status for immigrants living in the United States without legal authorization. Cruz was a vocal critic of the 2013 bill to change immigration laws written by Rubio and seven other senators. Cruz spoke out often against the bill and proposed amendments to triple border security, among changes. On May 21, 2013, Cruz issued a press release saying that he’d offered amendments to the Senate measure that day to "ensure that illegal immigrants are not given a path to citizenship, and modernize, streamline and expand legal immigration by reforming the green card program." Cruz told the Senate Judiciary Committee that if the path to citizenship were eliminated from the Senate plan, as he proposed, some 11 million residents living "in the shadows" would "still be eligible for RPI status." (RPI stands for Registered Provisional Immigrant program, which gives a work permit to a successful applicant to travel outside the United States and return.) The Senate plan included RPI status for 10 years and then immigrants would be eligible to apply for permanent residency, as in a green card. In June 2013, Cruz told NPR News that if senators embraced his proposal stripping out the path to citizenship option, the "11 million who are here illegally would be granted legal status once the border was secured — not before — but after the border was secured, they would be granted legal status. And indeed, they would be eligible for permanent legal residency. But they would not be eligible for citizenship." That amendment and comments Cruz made related it to it are the crux of Rubio’s argument about why he says Cruz supports legislation. The Texas Tribune/New York Times wrote in September 2013 that Cruz -- who tries to appeal to tea party conservatives and represents a state with a large Latino population -- was trying to "claim the middle ground on immigration." Asked about what to do with the people here illegally, however, he (Cruz) stressed that he had never tried to undo the goal of allowing them to stay. "The amendment that I introduced removed the path to citizenship, but it did not change the underlying work permit from the Gang of Eight," he said in 2013 in El Paso. After the Las Vegas debate, Rubio’s campaign cited comments Cruz made in November 2015. But we found that Cruz’s statements were vague because they left open the possibility of legalization. But he didn’t come out and support it outright. For example, at an event in Iowa Cruz said: "Let’s demonstrate we can stop illegal immigration, we can protect our national security interests, we can protect our law enforcement interests," Cruz said. "Then once that’s done, we can have a conversation at that point about whatever people remain here illegally." Cruz’s amendment appeared to be a tactic Cruz campaign spokesman Brian Phillips said that each example of Cruz mentioning work permits in the Senate plan amounted to Cruz simply explaining what would remain in the Senate plan if the path to citizenship element were yanked -- and, Phillips said, Cruz never said he would vote for the plan, regardless. Cruz has changed his mind on some aspects of immigration laws. In 2013, he supported expanding H1B visas but this year called for a suspension due to abuse. He also called for increasing the number of green cards but now says we should not increase the level of immigration as long as unemployment remains high. Mark Krikorian, who advocated against the 2013 bill, told Bloomberg News in November that Cruz’s amendment to remove the path to citizenship element was a legislative tactic. "You often introduce measures you hope will be poison pills if you're trying to kill a piece of legislation," said Krikorian who works for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration. Stephen Miller, a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., told Bloomberg News that "numerous conservatives offered amendments to the progressive Gang of Eight bill that were designed to improve enforcement or combat amnesty." He continued, "That does not mean these senators supported the bill with those changes. That would be an extremely untenable interpretation." (Sessions also fought against the bill.) Chris Chmielenski of NumbersUSA, an advocacy group that promotes reduced immigration, previously told PolitiFact he doesn’t think Cruz "was ever willing to support legalization" of immigrants living here "before enforcement" of border security. Chmielenski said that there also was no Cruz amendment proposing to give work permits to people living here without legal authorization. Cruz voted against the overall bill, which passed the Senate 68 to 32 in June 2013 and then died in the House. Our ruling Rubio said Cruz "is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally." Cruz proposed an amendment in 2013 to the immigration bill that would have stripped the citizenship provision. But it would have kept intact the language in the Senate bill that allowed illegal immigrants to still apply for the Registered Provisional Immigrant program in the overall bill, which would have resulted in a work permit and 10 years later application for permanent residency. But it’s a stretch for Rubio to label Cruz as a supporter of legalization when he was an ardent critic of the overall bill for months and voted against it. Cruz’s amendment appeared to be a legislative tactic. We rate this statement Mostly False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-12-16T12:51:44	2015-12-15	['Ted_Cruz']
pomt-07072	"The president released all of the oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-barack-obama-has-released-al/	During a June 26, 2011, interview on CBS’ Face the Nation, Rep. Michele Bachmann -- a Minnesota Republican who was one day away from officially announcing a bid for the presidency -- criticized President Barack Obama’s recent decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The reserve is a complex of four sites near the Gulf Coast that holds "emergency supplies of crude oil" owned by the U.S. government. On June 23, the Obama administration announced that it would release 30 million barrels of oil from the reserve, to "offset the disruption in the oil supply caused by unrest in the Middle East," according to the Energy Department. U.S. allies promised similar actions. On Face the Nation, Bachmann took aim at this policy. Her comment came as she responded to host Bob Schieffer’s question about the accuracy of some of her past statements as judged by PolitiFact. Schieffer specifically referenced a Truth-O-Meter item in which we gave Bachmann a Pants on Fire rating for saying that there had been only one offshore oil drilling permit during the Obama administration. Here’s a portion of the exchange between Schieffer and Bachmann: Bachmann: "It’s ironic and sad that the president released all of the oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve because the president doesn’t have an energy policy." Schieffer (overlapping): "Do you think that was a good move?" Bachmann: "He has a politically correct environmental policy." Schieffer (overlapping): "Was that a good thing?" Bachmann: "It was a very bad move. It pu t-- it has made the United States more vulnerable. There’s only a limited amount of oil that we have in the Strategic Oil Reserve. It’s there for emergencies. We do not -- the emergency that we have is the fact that ... the president of the United States has failed to give the American people an energy policy. Here’s the good news that a lot of Americans don’t even realize. We are the No. 1 energy resource-rich nation in the world according to the Congressional Research Service. But the president of the United States has unfortunately put American energy resources off limits." Several readers asked us to check Bachmann’s statement that "the president released all of the oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve," suggesting that Bachmann was incorrect in using the word "all" to describe the release. So we decided to look into it. We turned to the administration’s official announcement. Here’s an excerpt: "U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced today that the U.S. and its partners in the International Energy Agency have decided to release a total of 60 million barrels of oil onto the world market over the next 30 days to offset the disruption in the oil supply caused by unrest in the Middle East. As part of this effort, the U.S. will release 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The SPR is currently at a historically high level with 727 million barrels." So the release of 30 million barrels accounts for just over 4 percent of the current holdings in the reserve -- nowhere near "all" of it. It's possible Bachmann meant to say, "the president released oil" or "some oil" from the reserve, in which case she would have been accurate. (We reached out to Bachmann’s staff, but they did not respond to our inquiry by publication time.) However, we saw no effort by Bachmann to correct any misimpression from her comment, either in the Face the Nation interview or elsewhere. In any event, we give significant weight to the actual words a speaker says -- and viewers watching the interview would have been led to believe that Obama had released all the oil in the reserve. We rate Bachmann’s statement False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-06-27T15:04:35	2011-06-26	['None']
pomt-08717	On bringing casino gambling and other gaming to Georgia	half flip	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/03/nathan-deal/deal-makes-controversial-statements-about-casino-g/	GOP gubernatorial candidate Nathan Deal's recent statements on gambling made some conservatives cringe. During a forum on tourism in Savannah, Deal said the state should keep an "open mind" about casino gambling and other types of gaming. Conservative Christian groups objected, and seven days later, Deal told a television reporter that he didn't "favor it on a personal basis. I just don’t think you can gamble yourself out of a bad economy." News stories said Deal had a "change of heart" or was "not as open-minded" on the issue as he was before. Did Deal flip-flop? The AJC's PolitiFact Georgia took a closer look at Deal's statements and his record as a former U.S. congressman. Gambling wasn't an issue during the primary elections, but it is important among the social conservatives who helped Deal win a squeaker against Republican runoff opponent and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel. Members of the Georgia Christian Coalition and the Georgia Baptist Convention did not ask Deal for his position on gambling, their officials told the AJC's PolitiFact Georgia. Neither group endorses candidates, but if Deal did say he was open to looking into gambling, "it would have made a difference in the runoff," said Jerry Luquire, president of the Georgia Christian Coalition. Deal made his statement on gambling Aug. 18 during a Savannah Area Tourism Leadership Council forum on tourism. It was in response to a question by WTOC-TV anchor Sonny Dixon, who interviewed Deal and opponent Democrat Roy Barnes separately. "How do you feel about gaming, whether it was horse racing, casinos, whatever, in Georgia?" Dixon asked. "And if you‘re in favor of it, what do you think will be the process, how do you feel the process would go generally?" "Well, I certainly think that we ought to be open to discussions like that," Deal replied. "I do know there have been both successes and monstrous failures in terms of gaming in other states. I don’t think we should go into it with our eyes blinded. We ought to understand all of the ramifications of it to do it -- the bad, the social, and the costs associated with it that are sometimes not discussed in the general, opening debates about those things." After a brief aside about a horse he once owned, Deal added: "But I get there are potentials. We should look at it with an open mind. And we should not say 'no' just because of any particular bias one way or the other. I’m willing to keep an open mind with that and let's take a look at all the facts before we make a decision." Deal stopped short of endorsing casinos, but did say there are benefits to them and he supports looking into them in detail. Gambling foe Ray Newman, a lobbyist for the state Baptist Convention, was so concerned by Deal's statement that he called the candidate. He declined to give details of their conversation, saying it was private. But Newman did say this of Deal and casinos: "I don't know what his position is," Newman said. After the flap, Deal talked with WSB-TV reporter Lori Geary. Deal's spokesman talked with The Associated Press. Deal told Geary: "Well, I don’t favor it on a personal basis. I just don’t think you can gamble yourself out of a bad economy," and "What I was saying was that I would keep an open mind to suggestions of legislators." Later, Deal spokesman Brian Robinson told The Associated Press: "He [Deal] personally opposes casino gambling," and "Nathan does not believe gambling is the best way to create jobs." Deal's nearly two-decade record as a congressman shed little light on his views. While we did find votes against Internet gambling, we found no record he voted on casinos or other types of gaming. That's not surprising. The decision to allow casinos is made at the state level. We went to Robinson to clarify the issue. He repeated what Deal told WSB-TV and the AP, emphasizing that the issue was moot because gambling is against the state constitution. Expanding it would require a constitutional amendment, which cannot be vetoed by the governor. But governors do have significant sway. A governor, after all, has the state's bully pulpit and all the clout that goes with it. Legislators have to approve a proposed amendment by a two-thirds vote to get it on the ballot. They also have to pass a bill enacting it. A governor's opinion on a proposal can make or break it, said Steve Anthony, who has worked at the state Capitol and is a lecturer at Georgia State University. For instance, Gov. Zell Miller campaigned for a lottery to fund education initiatives such as the HOPE scholarship for college-bound students with good grades. As a result, the Georgia Lottery was founded in 1992. Also, the governor appoints the Georgia Lottery Board. Nearly two years ago, it was approached with a plan for opening a casino with video lottery terminals in Underground Atlanta. The board never voted on the issue, and the plan died. Robinson said Deal would appoint board members who will assure the HOPE scholarship's financial strength "without an expansion of gambling." So where does this leave us? Much of Deal's position on gambling is unclear. What, if anything, would it take to get him to endorse it? Would he commission a study on its economic impact? And what kinds of action might he take if Georgians decided to push for it? Like Baptist Convention lobbyist Newman, we don't know. But since the controversy, Deal has shifted what he says publicly about gambling. He's no longer using the phrase "open mind." He has not mentioned studying the pros and cons of gambling, either. Furthermore, Deal said he would support Lottery Board members who will support ensuring the financial stability of the HOPE scholarship without expanding gambling. In other words, Deal was saying one thing before the controversy. Now he's saying another. We give Deal a Half Flip.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-09-03T06:00:00	2010-08-18	['None']
pomt-01921	Republican candidate for governor Allan Fung "donated to Democrats like Congressman David Cicilline, disgraced (House) speaker Gordon Fox and even Mr. Obamacare, Harry Reid."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jun/29/kenneth-block/ken-block-knocks-republican-allan-fungs-donations-/	One of the issues in the Republican primary for governor is which candidate is more of a Republican. During the June 17 Providence Journal - WPRI debate businessman Ken Block attacked Cranston Mayor Allan Fung's past financial support of Democrats. "Did you know that Mayor Fung was a registered Democrat and he donated to Democrats like Congressman David Cicilline, disgraced [House] speaker Gordon Fox and even Mr. Obamacare, Harry Reid," Block said. The thought of a Republican giving money to Cicilline (who left Providence deeply in debt when he served as mayor), Fox (who left his post after federal investigators raided his office and home), and Reid (the U.S. Senate Majority Leader who championed the Affordable Care Act), would make most loyal members of the Grand Ol' Party cringe. So we decided to see whether Block was fairly characterizing the facts. To put everything in context, it's worth noting Fung's voting history. Cranston records show that Fung originally registered to vote in 1990, as a Democrat. He voted in the 1992 Democratic primary. He switched to unaffiliated in 1994 and back to Democrat in 1998, but then voted in the 1998 Republican primary. Since then he has voted in seven primaries, always as a Republican. Block's office sent us campaign finance data on Fung's contributions to the three Democrats, showing he donated to each candidate once. We confirmed the information on state and federal websites. But Block’s characterizations of Cicilline, Fox and Reid suggest the donations to them were recent. In fact, they weren’t. For example, the most recent of the three donations Block cited was Fung's $150 contribution to Fox. It was made in February 2008. Fox was House Majority Leader at the time, two years away from being elected speaker. The raid on his office was six years in the future. And even today, Fox has not been charged with any wrongdoing by state or federal authorities. The donation to Harry Reid, for $250, came in June 2004. Reid was the Senate Minority Whip. Obamacare wasn't even a gleam in Reid's eye when he got the money. The Cicilline donation for $250 is the oldest, made in March 2002. At the time, Cicilline was a state representative poised to run for mayor of Providence. When we asked Fung's campaign about the donations, spokesman Patrick Sweeney said the three donations of $650 should be compared to 113 donations Fung has made to Republicans totaling more than $25,000. Our ruling Ken Block said Allan Fung "donated to Democrats like Congressman David Cicilline, disgraced [House] speaker Gordon Fox and even Mr. Obamacare, Harry Reid." His statement is true to the extent that Fung donated once to each of those politicians. But his characterizations of the recipients were misleading. He referred to Cicilline as a congressman, but Cicilline was a state representative when Fung gave him money. He labeled Fox as the "disgraced" House speaker, but Fox was majority leader at the time of the Fung donation, and not under investigation. And the word "Obamacare" hadn’t even been coined when Fung donated to Reid. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-03904	Says the "last non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America concluded that #VoterID was necessary."	true	/texas/statements/2013/mar/01/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-last-non-partisan-body-election-r/	A Texas leader quickly responded to President Barack Obama’s announcement of a "non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America." Obama said in his Feb. 12, 2013, State of the Union address that he wanted the commission to focus on protecting the right to vote. "When any Americans – no matter where they live or what their party – are denied that right simply because they can’t wait for five, six, seven hours just to cast their ballot," Obama said, "we are betraying our ideals." Obama added that he was asking top attorneys from the 2012 Obama and Mitt Romney campaigns to lead the effort. Republican Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, responded on Twitter that night: "To #Obama: The last non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America concluded that #VoterID was necessary." Talk about a poke. State mandates requiring voters to present photo IDs at the polls have cleaved partisans. Republicans generally say such laws, including the 2011 Texas version that’s under legal challenge, will stop fraud. Democrats like Obama note there is little to no evidence of in-person voter fraud, also saying ID laws will deter voters, particularly minorities and the elderly, from going to the polls. And did the nation’s last non-partisan commission on voting conclude that IDs were needed at the polls? Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland guided us to a report by a commission co-chaired by former President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, and former U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, a Republican. The Sept. 19, 2005, report from the 21-member Commission on Federal Election Reform, organized by American University, opens with a letter from Carter and Baker stating, in part: "We are recommending a photo ID system for voters designed to increase registration with a more affirmative and aggressive role for states in finding new voters and providing free IDs for those without driver’s licenses. The formula we recommend will result in both more integrity and more access." The report notes that voters in nearly 100 democracies use a photo ID card without fear of infringement on their rights. The commission’s recommendation is that states require voters to use the REAL ID card, which at the time was expected to result in each state’s government-issued IDs meeting federal standards. "The card includes a person’s full legal name, date of birth, a signature (captured as a digital image), a photograph, and the person’s Social Security number," the report says. "This card should be modestly adapted for voting purposes to indicate on the front or back whether the individual is a U.S. citizen." And, the report says, states should provide such IDs to non-drivers at no charge. Until 2010, the recommendation says, states should "allow voters without a valid photo ID card ... to vote, using a provisional ballot by signing an affidavit under penalty of perjury. The signature would then be matched with the digital image of the voter’s signature on file in the voter registration database, and if the match is positive, the provisional ballot should be counted." At a press conference, Carter said he initially had reservations but was won over to the ID proposal because 24 states, including Georgia, had approved such measures and some of the laws were "abominable," making it hard for some residents to obtain the required IDs, according to the Political Transcript Wire. Carter added that the recommendation included "careful constraints to prevent abuse. For instance, these photo ID cards will be free. Second, there will be a wide distribution of them. The states will be required to go around the state to issue these photo ID cards to as many people as possible, which will be a good system just for recruiting new voters... And so, this will be, I think, a move forward in getting more people to vote. It would not restrict people from voting. It will be uniformly applied throughout the country. And it will be nondiscriminatory." At the press conference, Baker said he believes the commission came out "86 percent in favor" of the ID mandate because anyone who receives an ID would automatically be registered to vote. Three commission members, led by Tom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate leader, dissented from the ID recommendation, and other Democrats, including then-Sen. Obama of Illinois, reacted by saying the proposal was likely to deter low-income, minority and disabled voters from casting ballots. Daschle’s dissent was joined by Spencer Overton, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, and Raul Yzaguirre, former president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group. The dissent says some citizens would have difficulties coming up with the documents needed to obtain such IDs, such as driver licenses, for voting purposes. Those documents, the dissent says, include a "birth certificate, passport or naturalization papers, a photo identity document, and proof of Social Security number. Obtaining such documents can be difficult, even for those not displaced by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. For some, the commission’s ID proposal constitutes nothing short of a modern day poll tax." In an expanded dissent, Overton says "evidence suggests the type of fraud addressed by photo ID requirements is extraordinarily small and that the number of eligible citizens who would be denied their right to vote as a result of the commission's ID proposal is exceedingly large." By telephone, American University professor Robert A. Pastor, a commission member and its staff director, told us the commission had a balance of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Doug Chapin, an administrator at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, was the commission’s research director. Chapin told us by email the Carter-Baker effort was the latest national effort to review election laws. Our ruling Abbott said the "last non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America concluded that #VoterID was necessary." The Carter-Baker commission, the latest tri-partisan national body to review election reforms, recommended that states require citizens to present REAL ID cards to vote. Three of its 21 members dissented on the recommendation. The claim rates as True.	None	Greg Abbott	None	None	None	2013-03-01T10:00:00	2013-02-12	['United_States']
pomt-11024	Sen. Kamala Harris is "supporting the animals of MS-13."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2018/jul/03/donald-trump/pants-fire-white-house-claim-sen-harris-supporting/	The White House made an inflammatory attack on California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris this week, claiming on its official Twitter account that she is "supporting the animals of MS-13." Here’s the tweet from July 2, 2018: It’s part of a pattern of attacks by President Trump and his administration on Democrats over immigration enforcement and the violent gang MS-13, or La Mara Salvatrucha. The gang grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. For this fact check, we examined the tweet about Harris. We also reviewed similar attacks. Harris repudiates claim The White House did not respond to our request for evidence supporting the claim. Harris strongly rejected it, replying to the White House on Twitter: "As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That’s being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers." Harris was California’s attorney general and San Francisco’s district attorney before she was elected to the Senate in 2016. She is often mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential candidate. She added in another tweet: "My record speaks for itself: → Arrested members of drug trafficking organizations that smuggled in narcotics to the United States → Announced the arrests in a murder-for-hire plot by a Tijuana-based drug cartel → Confiscated 500lbs of meth from a Mexican cartel" We found no evidence Harris has ever supported or expressed any sympathy for MS-13. Pattern of baseless claims This is not the first rhetorical firebomb on MS-13 lobbed at Democrats by Trump or the White House. In a speech in May, Trump claimed California Rep. Nancy Pelosi "came out in favor of MS-13." PolitiFact found Pelosi hasn’t defended the gang and rated it False. Trump has repeated it in subsequent speeches. On the same day the White House tweeted about Harris, it also attacked Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, saying: "@SenWarren, why are you supporting criminals moving weapons, drugs, and victims across our nation’s borders? You must not know what ICE really does." Democrats, including Harris, Pelosi and Warren, have criticized Trump’s policy of separating children from migrants and asylum seekers entering the country. They’ve also called for reforming, or in some cases abolishing, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, and replacing it with a new agency. They have not, however, explicitly called for ending immigration enforcement. Nor have they made statements in favor of MS-13. Here’s what Harris said on MSNBC in June about ICE: "I think there’s no question that we’ve got to critically re-examine ICE and its role and the way it is being administered and the work it is doing," Harris said. "And we need to probably think about starting from scratch because there's a lot that is wrong with the way that it's conducting itself. And we need to deal with that." Our ruling The White House attacked Sen. Kamala Harris for "supporting the animals of MS-13," in a tweet from its official account. Harris and other Democrats have sharply criticized the Trump administration for its immigration policies. They have expressed concern about how those entering the country, legally and illegally, are treated and called for reforming or replacing ICE. That’s not the same thing as or even close to "supporting" a violent criminal gang. We found no information showing Harris has supported or sympathized with MS-13.

pomt-04351	Says Barack Obama was silent on Iran "when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, (and) the Green Revolution occurred."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-was-silent-about-protests-a/	While much of the foreign policy debate was about what President Barack Obama has said and done, Mitt Romney leveled a charge about an area where he said Obama had been silent. "And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake," Romney said during the Oct. 22 foreign policy debate at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla. Later in the debate, Obama responded: "And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for." Romney was referring to the protests that followed the June 13, 2009, re-election of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. We will fact-check Romney’s claim that Obama was "silent" when the protests happened after that election. After Ahmadinejad won, supporters of opponent Mir Hossein Mousavi "burned dumpsters, threw stones and clashed with police in the worst rioting in Tehran in many years," the Washington Post reported. It was the largest protest since the 1979 revolution and hundreds of thousands poured into the streets. The government cracked down on the protesters -- Amnesty International wrote a few months later that thousands were arrested after the elections and that dozens were killed. Both the Romney and Obama campaigns sent us statements by Obama and news coverage about what he did -- and didn’t -- say in the days and weeks after that June 13, 2009, election. Let’s look at Obama’s statements day by day. June 13, 2009 Press secretary Robert Gibbs released a brief statement: "Like the rest of the world, we were impressed by the vigorous debate and enthusiasm that this election generated, particularly among young Iranians. We continue to monitor the entire situation closely, including reports of irregularities." June 15, 2009 During a press conference with visiting prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, Obama was asked a question about the violence in Iran. Obama said he was "deeply troubled by the violence that I've been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process -- free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are universal values and need to be respected. And whenever I see violence perpetrated on people who are peacefully dissenting, and whenever the American people see that, I think they're, rightfully, troubled. ..." Obama said that he would continue to pursue dialogue with Iran. "But even as we do so, I think it would be wrong for me to be silent about what we've seen on the television over the last few days. And what I would say to those people who put so much hope and energy and optimism into the political process, I would say to them that the world is watching and inspired by their participation, regardless of what the ultimate outcome of the election was. And they should know that the world is watching. And particularly to the youth of Iran, I want them to know that we in the United States do not want to make any decisions for the Iranians, but we do believe that the Iranian people and their voices should be heard and respected." Still, that response was widely considered subdued. The Washington Post wrote June 15 that the administration "has remained as quiet as possible" and that Obama’s response was "subdued" as he was seeking balance "between condemning what increasingly appears to be a fraudulent election and the likelihood that it will be dealing with Ahmadinejad after the dust settles." Romney pounced on Obama on ABC’s This Week on June 14: "What has occurred is that the election is a fraud, the results are inaccurate, and you're seeing a brutal repression of the people as they protest. The president ought to come out and state exactly those words, indicate that this has been a terribly managed decision by the autocratic regime in Iran." In a June 17, 2009, article the New York Times stated that officials in Washington were debating whether Obama’s response had been too muted. Some officials including Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for a stronger tone, while others in the White House said that could lead to the idea that the protests were led by Americans: "So far, Mr. Obama has largely followed that script, criticizing violence against the protesters, but saying that he does not want to be seen as meddling in Iranian domestic politics," the New York Times reported. June 16, 2009 During a press conference while meeting with President Lee Myung-Bak of the Republic of Korea, when asked about Iran, Obama said that he had "deep concerns about the election. .... Now, it's not productive, given the history of U.S.-Iranian relations, to be seen as meddling -- the U.S. President meddling in Iranian elections. What I will repeat and what I said yesterday is that when I see violence directed at peaceful protestors, when I see peaceful dissent being suppressed, wherever that takes place, it is of concern to me and it's of concern to the American people. That is not how governments should interact with their people." He called for allowing "people's voices should be heard and not suppressed." The Washington Post reported that Obama went on CNBC on June 16 and said: "When you've got 100,000 people who are out on the streets peacefully protesting, and they're having to be scattered through violence and gunshots, what that tells me is the Iranian people are not convinced of the legitimacy of the election. And my hope is that the regime responds not with violence, but with a recognition that the universal principles of peaceful expression and democracy are ones that should be affirmed." June 19, 2009 The New York Times wrote that in an interview with CBS news on June 19, "Obama spoke cautiously about warnings by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, of bloodshed if the protests go on. ''I'm very concerned, based on some of the tenor and tone of the statements that have been made, that the government of Iran recognize that the world is watching." June 20, 2009 In a statement specifically about Iran, Obama said: "...We mourn each and every innocent life that is lost. We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people. The universal rights to assembly and free speech must be respected, and the United States stands with all who seek to exercise those rights. As I said in Cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government. If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect the dignity of its own people and govern through consent, not coercion...." June 23, 2009 In a statement about Iran, Obama spoke more strongly: "The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings and imprisonments of the last few days. I strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join with the American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost..." He said that while the United States is not interfering with Iran’s affairs, "we deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place. The Iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future. Some in Iran -- some in the Iranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the United States and others in the West of instigating protests over the elections. ..." Later analysis In September 2012, the New York Times wrote an article looking back at how Obama handled the Arab Spring: "...as large street protests broke out in Iran after disputed presidential elections, Mr. Obama followed a low-key script, criticizing violence but saying he did not want to be seen as meddling in Iranian domestic politics. Months later, administration officials said, Mr. Obama expressed regret about his muted stance on Iran. ‘There was a feeling of "we ain’t gonna be behind the curve on this again," ‘ one senior administration official said, who spoke to the New York Times on condition of anonymity." We asked the White House after the debate if it could confirm that anonymous statement and did not get an immediate reply. Our ruling Romney said that Obama was silent "when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred." Romney was referring to the aftermath of the June 13, 2009, re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which led to massive protests. Two days later on June 15, in response to a question at a press conference, Obama said he was "deeply troubled" by the violence, and that it would be wrong for him to remain silent. Obama made similar remarks the next day. On June 20, he issued a statement specifically calling on the Iranian government to stop the violence, and on June 23 he condemned the government for its response. Obama was criticized for showing a muted response in the days following the start of the protests. But it is an exaggeration to say that Obama was "silent." We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05797	"This president ... could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-could-have-gotten-cr/	Mitt Romney told an Arizona debate audience that President Barack Obama’s most "serious failure" as president has been "his failure to deal with Iran appropriately." "We simply cannot allow Iran to have nuclear weaponry ..." Romney said at the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Mesa, Ariz. "This president ... could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not." Obama signed new U.S. sanctions against Iran in December. We wondered: What did Romney mean by "could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran"? And is that true? Romney’s statement Romney’s criticism came as part of his answer to an audience question about how candidates planned to deal "with the growing nuclear threat from Iran." Romney answered: "Look, the price of gasoline pales in comparison to the idea of Ahmadinejad with nuclear weapons. Ahmadinejad having fissile material that he can give to Hezbollah and Hamas and that they can bring into Latin America and potentially bring across the border into the United States to let off dirty bombs here — or more sophisticated bombs here. We simply cannot allow Iran to have nuclear weaponry. And this president has a lot of failures. ... his policies in a whole host of areas have been troubling. "But nothing in my view is as serious a failure as his failure to deal with Iran appropriately. This president should have put in place crippling sanctions against Iran, he did not. He decided to give Russia their No. 1 foreign policy objective, removal of our missile defense sites from Eastern Europe, and got nothing in return. He could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not. When dissident voices took to the street in Iran to protest a stolen election there, instead of standing with them, he bowed to the election. This is a president … who has made it clear through his administration in almost every communication we've had so far, that he does not want Israel to take action. That he opposes military action. This is a president who should have instead communicated to Iran that we are prepared, that we are considering military options. They're not just on the table. They are in our hand. We must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. If they do, the world changes. America will be at risk. And some day, nuclear weaponry will be used. If I am president, that will not happen. If we reelect Barack Obama, it will happen." For this fact-check, we’re focusing on the claim, "this president ... could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not." First, a little background. Iran has faced U.S. sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution. The United Nations and other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Iran’s efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress. The Obama administration’s policy has been to combine sanctions with negotiations. But since Iran has yet to compromise, the administration has sought "additional U.S., U.N., and allied country sanctions whose cumulative effect could compel Iran to accept a nuclear bargain." That includes signing into law on Dec. 31, 2011, a bill that sanctions foreign financial institutions that do business with the Central Bank of Iran. The country now has the "most sweeping sanctions on Iran of virtually any country in the world," according to a February 2012 Congressional Research Service report. Have the sanctions achieved the core goal of changing Iran’s commitment to its nuclear program? No. But they are weakening Iran’s economy, raising the possibility that Iran’s stance "might be in the process of reassessment," the report says. And that’s exactly what Romney has said the goal would be when he used the phrase "crippling sanctions" in the past, such as at a Nov. 22, 2011 presidential debate: "The right course in America is to stand up to Iran with crippling sanctions ... put in place the kind of crippling sanctions that stop their economy." Iran’s economy was already "in turmoil," according to the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in March 2010, in part due to "biting external sanctions." President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in November 2011 that sanctions were causing significant problems for the nation’s banking sector — after new U.N. and U.S. sanctions signed by Obama in 2010, but before U.S. sanctions on the country’s Central Bank. After the new sanctions were imposed, the nation’s currency took a steep slide. What Romney’s campaign says We asked Romney’s campaign for support for his statement that the president, "could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran." He was arguing two things, spokesman Ryan Williams said — that the president "failed to secure a range of sanctions" from the United Nations in 2010, and that he has resisted congressional efforts to impose tough sanctions. Both of those arguments have weaknesses. And neither fully support the statement "this president ... could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not." What the U.N. did The United Nations in 2010 voted to sanction Iran but didn’t include among those sanctions measures against the nation’s Central Bank because of opposition from Russia and China. The argument that the president "could have" gotten tougher sanctions suggests it was Obama’s choice, rather than diplomatic reality. "The real issue is that Russia and China would not go along with anything stronger than what the U.S. got in 2010. So the U.S. was stuck," said Leonard Spector of the Monterey Institute of International Studies at Middlebury College. Romney has argued that Obama should have leveraged Russia’s desire for removal of missile defense sites in Eastern Europe — but instead "got nothing in return." But he hasn’t offered a similar inducement he feels could have been used to convince China, which said it wouldn’t support any measure it felt would harm world economic recovery or affect the Iranian people or normal trade, according to the New York Times. "Unless Gov. Romney has some ideas for how he would have appealed more to the Chinese and the Russians, it's hard to criticize the president's performance at the U.N," said Michael Levi, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "The amount of effort this administration put into getting multilateral sanctions at the U.N. Security Council was extraordinary." The administration instead said it would push forward with tougher sanctions on its own. And it did — with the president signing into law at least two new rounds of sanctions and an executive order toughening the U.S. position. What Congress did But Romney’s campaign argues that Congress deserves full credit for recent efforts, such as the legislation targeting the Central Bank. Tougher sanctions imposed by the United States in the past few months "weren’t done by Obama," but through an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that Obama opposed, tried to water down, and won exceptions for, Romney’s spokesman said. (The administration argued the amendment, which passed despite the administration's objections, could "alienate foreign countries, make it more difficult to pressure Iran and raise oil prices, which could actually help the Iranian economy," according to Foreign Policy’s The Cable.) "In implementing them, he was only doing what he was required to by an act of Congress," Williams said. Meanwhile, Obama wrote a signing statement saying that the sanction’s requirements were nonbinding, Williams noted. (Obama wrote that the Iran sanctions section "would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments. Like section 1244, should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, I will treat the provisions as non-binding.") Obama also undermined the sanctions’ requirement for countries seeking exceptions to "significantly reduce" their Iranian crude oil purchases by leaving the definition of "significant" to the discretion of the secretary of state, Williams said. (Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill., authors of the amendment, argued it should mean at least 18 percent.) Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations says that’s not evidence of a weak stance on Iran or sanctions — but resistance to letting Congress dictate the terms. "This is the sort of thing where there are so many variables that any rigid set of rules is almost certain to miss certain … elements of reality," he said. "Flexibility is the watchword. It's really hard to argue that this administration hasn't brought strong pressure to bear on Iran." Leonard Spector of the Monterey Institute of International Studies at Middlebury College agreed that the administration has been a driving force internationally to put pressure on Iran, even if it failed to get the U.N. to target Iran’s Central Bank. "Obama unilaterally and in concert with the E.U. and other allies has gone much further," he said. Spector argues that isolation of the Iranian Central Bank, a cutoff of Iranian crude oil purchases that the United States won agreement to by the European Union and others and the pending decision of Brussels-based global electronic money transfer system SWIFT to deny Iran access to international check clearing "are indeed going to be crippling." "This is not being done through the U.N., but it is most definitely the result of the U.S. leading the way and pressing for these measures," he said. Spector, who worked on nonproliferation issues for the Department of Energy under the Clinton administration, said "a good deal of leadership" has been behind the scenes. In summer 2010, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea all adopted sanctions that went well beyond what the U.N. required. That was all coordinated by the United States, he said. Avner Cohen, a senior fellow at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, said you might fairly argue that the administration could have pursued tougher sanctions outside the U.N. Security Council — such as against Iran’s Central Bank — earlier. But that’s not what Romney said. "If Romney refers to U.N. Security Council sanctions, four waves of sanctions have passed so far. I do not think that more crippling sanctions could have passed …" Cohen said. "As typical for political statements, it has some ring of truth, but it is vague and overstated." Our ruling Mitt Romney said, "this president ... could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not." The reality is that a combination of international and U.S. efforts are now in place that some consider crippling to Iran’s economy. Romney's campaign argues he was specifically referring to a failure to get the United Nations to enact sanctions against Iran’s Central Bank in 2010. But some experts argue he couldn’t have achieved tougher U.N. sanctions, given opposition from Russia and China. Meanwhile, Romney’s campaign argues Obama hasn’t fully supported U.S. sanctions against Iran. It’s true that Obama resisted Congress dictating the administration’s strategy. But that’s not support for the statement that he "could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran" but "did not." We rate Romney’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-04019	"Forty-seven percent of (members of Congress) are millionaires."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/04/rob-woodall/congress-millionaires-club/	Despite the pathetically poor approval ratings of Congress these days, there is apparently one big advantage to being elected to the nation’s legislative body. Nearly one-half of them are millionaires, one Georgia congressman said. Rob Woodall, a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Gwinnett County, made the claim in response to a question at a town hall meeting about the grass-roots effort to stop members of Congress from getting paid if they don’t pass a budget. Woodall began his reply by needling the Democratic-led U.S. Senate for boasting that it plans to pass a budget this year. The Senate hasn’t passed a budget resolution since April 2009. Woodall then made his claim about the wealth of Congress. "Forty-seven percent of (members of Congress) are millionaires. They don’t care if they don’t get paid," the congressman said at the Jan. 25 town hall meeting he hosted at the Gwinnett government complex in Lawrenceville. PolitiFact Georgia was at the meeting and wondered whether Congress is in fact a millionaires club. Woodall voted Jan. 23 in favor of the No Budget, No Pay Act that passed in the House by a 285-144 vote. Thursday, the Senate passed the resolution, which also extended the debt ceiling to May. The bill states that the salaries of Congress be held in an escrow account if there is no budget passed by April 15. To Woodall’s point, many of his colleagues are business owners, attorneys and doctors who earned a good living before coming to Washington. Congress also pays well. Most members make an annual salary of $174,000. Members of Congress are required to file annual financial disclosure reports, which detail information about investments and liabilities. Last year, The Washington Post published a series of articles detailing the net financial worth of each member of Congress, using that information and other sources. The Post’s calculations do not include assets lawmakers are not required to disclose, such as personal residences, which could increase the net worth of some members. In January, the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics’ website unveiled a database detailing the minimum, average and maximum net worth of nearly every member of the current Congress. The research shows many of them are rich. Very rich. The median estimated net worth of Congress is $966,000, according to the center. By contrast, the median net worth of the typical American household is slightly more than $66,000. Ten members had a net worth greater than $100 million on one or both sites. The multimillionaires include: -- House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who has at least $3 million in stocks and mutual funds. -- U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., whose road to riches began in the 1970s as a writer on "Saturday Night Live." He has a listed net worth of about $8 million. -- Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the former CEO of a company that created the Viper anti-theft system for vehicles, who has a net worth of nearly $500 million. -- Outgoing U.S. senator and newly-appointed Secretary of State John Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts, whose wife is an heiress of the Heinz ketchup fortune. He has an estimated net worth of about $200 million. -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, whose family real estate holdings are worth an estimated $100 million. -- Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina, who was appointed to the Senate in January and owns about $3 million worth of real estate. But there are some members who could use every penny they can get at the moment. Fourteen members had negative net worths on both sites. Many of them have taken out major loans for their businesses, such as U.S. Rep. David Valadao of California, or owe large sums in legal fees, such as U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings of Florida. Both are millions of dollars in debt, according to the CRP, which is better known as Open Secrets. We thought the net worth was a reasonable approach to determining whether someone is a millionaire. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed the Post’s and the center’s research to determine the percentage of current members of Congress who are millionaires. The net worth was the same or close for many members. There were a few cases in which the net worth varied greatly. There are some vacant congressional seats, such as the one once held by Jesse Jackson Jr. in Illinois, and a couple of new members whose net worth wasn’t on the Open Secrets list. We considered members of Congress a millionaire if both databases had their net worth as greater than $1 million or if their net worth was found to be close to $1 million by one group and greater than $1 million by the other group. We also included new members of Congress on our list if Open Secrets concluded their net worth is greater than $1 million. By using that criteria, there are 257 members of Congress we believe belong in the millionaire category, which accounted for 48.5 percent of all members who had financial information available on either the Post or Open Secrets websites. Woodall, by the way, is not part of the millionaires club. Woodall, who previously worked as chief of staff to now-retired U.S. Rep. John Linder of Georgia, has a net worth of about $300,000, according to both sites. Seven of Georgia’s 14 members of Congress had a net worth greater than $1 million. They are John Barrow, Phil Gingrey, Tom Graves, Johnny Isakson, Jack Kingston, Tom Price and Austin Scott. U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, who announced last month that he will not seek another Senate term in 2014, has a net worth of $337,505, according to the Post and about $400,000, according to Open Secrets. To sum up, Woodall said 47 percent of the members of Congress are millionaires. The research we found shows there’s a very strong case that he’s correct. We rate his claim True.

pomt-09219	"Rick Scott's even saying he wants more offshore drilling."	true	/florida/statements/2010/may/18/alex-sink/rick-scott-supports-oil-drilling/	The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has made offshore drilling an important issue in many Florida campaigns. In the governor's race, Democrat Alex Sink says that one of her Republican opponents, Rick Scott, wants to expand drilling. Sink campaign manager Jim Cassady wrote an e-mail May 15, 2010, that said: "While we've been fighting to end drilling, neither of Alex's Republican opponents will support the amendment to ban drilling off Florida's coast -- Bill McCollum won't, and Rick Scott's even saying he wants more offshore drilling. We can't stand by and let a disaster like this happen again." We were interested in the part of the claim about Scott. In the wake of the massive spill, is Scott arguing for more offshore drilling? Sink's campaign pointed us to Scott's website that includes his position on "energy independence": Energy Independence is not just critical to our economic security, it is also it crucial (sic) to our national security. We must stop being dependent on other countries for oil. We need to build more nuclear plants, invest in alternative fuels and drill off shore. But we must ensure that Florida’s beaches are protected. ... As we explore the expansion of domestic drilling in the U.S. we must ensure that we have sound policies in place that ensure the companies drilling are doing so in an environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards. ... Rick supports expansion of nuclear power, use of alternative fuels and off-shore drilling. Sink's campaign also sent us a May 11 Palm Beach Post blog that said Scott would oppose a constitutional ban on offshore drilling. Some political leaders have called for a ballot measure prohibiting drilling within 10 miles of Florida's coast. "We need to protect our beaches, break our dependency on foreign oil and hold oil companies accountable when there are problems," Scott said, according to the blog. "As governor, I’ll look to strike a balance between responsible exploration that takes every precaution and is far enough from our shores while holding oil companies accountable for their mistakes." We asked Scott's campaign if he supports an expansion of oil drilling. Spokesperson Jennifer Baker said that Scott's statement about drilling was posted on his website before the April 20 spill but was later clarified to add the phrase calling for policies to allow drilling in an "environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards." That phrase was included on his website as of May 17, 2010. She said Scott supports drilling on the condition that it be done safely. "He states that it must be done safely, we need to figure out what went wrong with the BP spill and hold the people responsible accountable and in the future drilling should be part of a comprehensive energy strategy that makes the United States energy independent," Baker said. She sent us a link to an interview on WIOD News Radio in which he was asked if he wanted to continue to drill. "I believe we can come up with a way to drill with the right precautions,'' Scott said. Scott's campaign doesn't dispute that he is in favor of offshore drilling and against a constitutional ban -- as long as the drilling is done safely. Certainly any candidate or politician who supports drilling wants it done safely -- we don't believe that makes Sink's claim inaccurate. Sink's campaign said that Scott wants "even more offshore drilling'' -- and that's an accurate account of what he's said. We find this claim True.

pomt-08601	State pension fund staffers "lost billions. Then Sink gave them bonuses."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/23/republican-party-florida/gop-says-alex-sink-gave-bonuses-state-pension-work/	Millions of Americans had that stomach-churning feeling when the headlines announced another bad day on Wall Street as stock and bond markets plunged in value. People watched helplessly as investment nest eggs cracked, leaving many -- particularly seniors -- worried they would never recover what they had dutifully built up in savings. That raw fear is exploited in a new statewide television ad paid for by the Republican Party of Florida on behalf of the Rick Scott for governor campaign and against Democrat Alex Sink. The 30-second ad began airing on Sept. 21, 2010. It opens with black and white photos of older people as a narrator says: "You worked your whole life. You saved. It's your pension. You earned it. But with Alex Sink in charge, Florida’s pension fund has lost 24 billion dollars. That's not a typo. $24 billion -- gone." The ad continues: "Experts even warned Sink she was making risky investments. Sink gave bonuses to staffers. They were hired to invest our seniors' money. Lost billions. Then Sink gave them bonuses. And now she wants a promotion?" It's less than six weeks to the election, and television is loaded with ads that take facts or issues out of context. The Associated Press labeled the RPOF ad "deceptive," and, within hours of its release, the Sink campaign sent out an e-mail statement firing back. That statement targeted Scott, claiming that the Florida pension fund lost money when his former company, Columbia/HCA, was hit with fraud charges and the pension fund had to sue his company. To get to the truth and put the GOP ad in perspective, there are four questions to probe here. One is: Did the Florida pension fund lose $24 billion and is it "gone?" A second is whether Sink was "in charge?" Did experts warn her "she was making risky investments?" And, did Sink give "bonuses to staffers" who lost billions? Let’s start with some background. Sink is Florida’s chief financial officer and is required by law to sit as one of three members of the Board of Trustees on the State Board of Administration. The board has oversight authority over the state's largest pension fund, known as the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund. The other members of the board are Gov. Charlie Crist and Attorney General Bill McCollum. Losses The trust fund is a massive investment account, today worth about $117 billion and holding the retirement assets of about 1 million current and retired state employees, as well as some local police and firefighters. It is one of the largest retirement funds in the nation, even the world. According to the last actuarial report completed in 2009, the fund is 88.5 percent funded -- meaning if every employee retired today, they would get 88.5 percent of their retirement benefits. A funding level of 80 percent is considered healthy. So when Wall Street melted down, and stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets began their steep decline in 2008, the value of Florida's retirement fund fell, too. Did the retirement fund lose $24 billion? RPOF does the math this way: On June 30, 2007, the fund was at its peak at $138.4 billion and by June 30, 2010, the value had declined to $109.34 billion, a $29 billion drop in value. The RPOF cites the $4.5 billion paid out to retirees in 2009-10 and concludes the net investment loss is $24.56 billion. Their number is wrong for these reasons: First, the value of the fund was $136.4 billion, not $138.4 billion, in June 2007. And second, the party subtracted the 2009-2010 payments to retirees from that three-year loss, but failed to subtract the payments to retirees in the other two years as well. Those payments were $3.4 billion in 2007-2008 and $3.2 billion in 2008-2009. If they had subtracted all three years, the drop in value since 2007, then, is $15.96 billion. But party spokesman Dan Conston then said that none of the payouts should have subtracted unless new contributions from the state and other agencies were also added, and he didn’t provide those amounts. In addition to getting the number wrong, the ad also is inaccurate when it suggests that the money is gone. The loss in value represented a snapshot in time and since June 30, 2010, the trust fund had recovered $8 billion. By Sept. 21, 2010, when the ad began airing, the value of the fund was back to $117 billion, making the net change from the June 30, 2007, value just $8.3 billion. It's become common to refer to drops in value as losses but, as Dennis MacKee, spokesman for the SBA, points out, "These are changes in net asset values, (they) are not losses until you sell. You don't realize a loss in value until you sell the asset." We agree. The nature of investing is to see values rise and fall, and it is inaccurate to say that $24 billion of the state pension fund is "gone" when that number is wrong and it's not a permanent loss anyway. In charge State law requires the SBA to "make purchases, sales, exchanges, investments, and reinvestments for and on behalf of the funds" and "see that moneys invested under the provisions of ss. 215.44-215.53 are at all times handled in the best interests of the state." Does that mean Sink was "in charge" of the pension fund? According to the statute, the three-member board "may retain investment advisers or managers, or both, external to in-house staff, to assist the board in carrying out the power specified," and the board "shall create an audit committee to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities." The SBA policy statement, which the trustees approve, requires that "the Board delegates to the Executive Director the administrative and investment authority, within the statutory limitations and rules, to manage the investment of FRS assets." MacKee describes it this way: "Trustees generally deal at a policy level while their appointees assist at a more strategic level." Ash Williams is the SBA's executive director, and the job of investing the state's assets is divided between in-house investment managers and external investment managers. The type of investment often determines whether the asset is managed internally or with an outside firm. For example, 60 percent of all domestic equities, foreign equity and fixed income investments are managed by external managers while most real estate, private equity and strategic investments are managed internally, MacKee said. So as a trustee, Sink does not actually do the investing. The RPOF ad is carefully worded, and we agree it is accurate to say Sink was "in charge," along with the two other trustees. But we believe the implication that she had a broader role in investment outcomes is misleading. Expert warnings We asked RPOF what they were referring to when the ad said that "experts even warned Sink she was making risky investments." We’ve established it's inaccurate to say that Sink was making the investments, so let's look at whether she and the other trustees were warned. RPOF cited a Jan. 25, 2009, St. Petersburg Times story that cited audits warning the SBA that it was overexposed to risk and cited specifically the investment in a $5.4 billion apartment complex on 80 acres in Manhattan known as Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The investment was indeed a boondoggle, a real estate deal anchored down by both too much debt and too high a price tag. When the bonds on the property were downgraded and the investment eventually collapsed this year, Florida’s SBA was forced to write off its entire $250 million investment, a $266 million net loss. It's a fair question to ask whether Sink, as a member of the SBA, asked enough questions and demanded enough answers when the agency auditors were raising these warnings. It is not accurate to imply that she alone was making the investments. Could Sink have done more? It's a good question but the ad doesn't ask; it concludes she knew all. MacKee said that with 15,000 individual securities and 36 managed investment funds with different investment objectives, the odds of large fluctuations in value are great depending on the daily shifts in the market. "We've had the value of the pension fund in one day move by more than $1 billion…To think you’d have the opportunity with any governing board to look at individual investments -- it's not done at that level." Bonuses The RPOF cites an April 16, 2008, story in the Palm Beach Post about bonuses handed out to 17 SBA employees "from $371 to $2,500 for their work during an unprecedented two-week, $16 billion run of withdrawals." In addition to the retirement account, the SBA manages the Local Government Investment Pool, which was facing a slew of withdrawals after news broke that the pool had lost value because of investments in risky, mortgage-backed securities. The facts are more complicated. The losses in the Local Government Investment Pool were the result of investments in asset-backed commercial paper starting in 2000, before Sink was elected to office, MacKee said. Unlike the pension fund, which can handle the kind of volatility in those markets, the LGIP is "managed as a liquidity fund, basically a bank account," he said. So when local governments started to see the value of the LGIP drop because of the risky securities, many panicked and started to withdraw money in droves -- $16 billion over two weeks in November 2007. The bonus checks were in the works for more than a year before they were handed out, MacKee said. The SBA has an internal policy for allocating bonuses, based on a fixed set of performance measures reached by staff who manage the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund, MacKee said. The bonuses were distributed in January 2008 based on the performance of the retirement fund between June 2006 and June 2007, he said. That was the year the fund reached its peak of $136.4 billion. It was also the last time bonuses were paid, MacKee said, and "the checks were cut in 2008 because you need to know what the performance was." Did Sink approve the bonuses? Not directly. It was included in the 2007-08 SBA budget, MacKee said, and Sink and the other trustees approved the budget. On this point, the RPOF is again misleading. More importantly, the ad inaccurately implies that the bonuses were linked to the investment losses. Our ruling Now let's return to the key claim, that state pension fund staffers "lost billions. Then Sink gave them bonuses." This ad accurately highlights Sink's oversight role of the state's pension fund but after that, this ad stretches the facts and misleads the viewer. The $24 billion is not gone. Sink did not personally make the risky investments or give bonuses to staffers, and the staff bonuses preceded the fund's loss in value. We rate the RPOF ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07961	"Despite the administration telling us (health care reform) was going to reduce health care costs, they now acknowledge it's going to dramatically increase health care costs."	false	/texas/statements/2011/jan/23/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-says-obama-administration-said-health-/	U.S. House Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, recently said Congress should start over on health care reform "and do it much better and do it right." In an interview that aired Jan. 5, before the new GOP-controlled House voted to repeal the law, Smith also told Austin's KUT, 90.5 FM: "Despite the (Obama) administration telling us it was going to reduce health care costs, they now acknowledge it's going to dramatically increase health care costs." Has Obama backpedaled on the law's cost impact? He has certainly said the law would cut costs. In a September 2009 interview, he said health care reform was "going to start driving down our costs over the long term." In November 2009, he said: "The bill that the House has produced will provide stability and security for Americans who have insurance; quality, affordable options for those who don't; and lower costs for American families and business. And as I've insisted from the beginning, it is a bill that is fully paid for and will actually reduce our long-term federal debt." And in April, Obama said: "Over time, costs will come down for families, businesses, and the federal government, reducing our deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next two decades. That's what reform will do." Smith spokeswoman Sally-Shannon Scales told us in an e-mail that an April 22 memo — by "the president's own actuary at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services" — shows the administration's shift. Scales was referring to the Office of the Actuary within the CMS, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The heads of both agencies are Obama appointees, though we learned that the office's chief actuary, Richard Foster, is not. Foster told us via e-mail that the actuary "by statute and by longstanding past practice...operates independently, on a nonpartisan basis, in providing actuarial, economic and other technical information to the administration, Congress and the public." According to U.S. Code, the actuary performs "in accordance with professional standards of actuarial independence." The actuary's April memo opens by saying the office was analyzing health care costs in its "longstanding capacity as an independent technical advisor to both the administration and the Congress... The statements, estimates and other information provided in this memorandum are those of the Office of the Actuary and do not represent an official position of the Department of Health and Human Services or the administration." The memo also cautions that the actuary's estimates were just that, calling the law's impact on health expenditures "very uncertain." Broadly, the memo estimates that national spending on health care will increase $311 billion from 2010 through 2019 — which is nearly 1 percent more than what would have been spent without the law largely because 34 million more people are expected to obtain insurance. "Numerous studies have demonstrated that individuals and families with health insurance use more health services than otherwise-similar persons without insurance," the memo says. "Although several provisions would help reduce health care cost growth, their impact would be more than offset through 2019 by the higher health expenditures resulting from coverage expansions." Over time, provisions designed to help control costs "would have a noticeable downward effect on the level of national health expenditures," though the memo airs doubts that the provisions, such as reducing Medicare payments to health care providers, would be sustainable. Foster told us that since the April memo, the office "hasn't changed its estimate that total U.S. health expenditures will increase somewhat," and the Obama administration also hasn't backed off its stance. A day after the memo appeared, a White House official objected. On The White House Blog, Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, wrote: "There are some areas where we disagree with the actuary, particularly when it comes to the new law and the growth of health care costs." DeParle wrote that the actuary "discounts proposals that other independent experts credit with getting at the root causes of health care cost growth," such as state health insurance exchanges, which DeParle said will "set up a competition choice system that would pressure insurers to lower premiums." Obama's wasn't the first administration to disagree with the actuary. Previously, an investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services found that a CMS administrator appointed by George W. Bush threatened to fire Foster "if he told Congress that drug benefits would probably cost much more than the White House acknowledged," according to a July 2004 New York Times news article. "As a result, Mr. Foster's cost estimate did not become known until after the legislation was enacted." When we followed up with Scales, she pointed us to a Fox News clip of Obama posted Sept. 10 on Real Clear Politics, a politics website. In it, Obama says the administration knew it would cost money to insure 30 million additional people, adding: "We didn't think we were going to cover 30 million people for free. But that the longterm trend in terms of how much the average family is going to be paying for health insurance is going to be improved as a consequence of health care." The president was responding to a reporter's question about another study on the health care law, by another team from the actuary's office. The study estimated that the law would have "negligible effects on total national health spending in the next 10 years, neither slowing nor fueling the explosive growth of medical costs," according to a Sept. 9 Times news article. The actuary's September report says about 32.5 million people will obtain health coverage through 2019, and national health spending will grow at an annual rate of 6.3 percent — 0.2 percent more than it would without the law. This estimate, like the April one, covers all health care spending by state, federal, local and private entities. In contrast, a March projection by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked solely at how federal spending would change, stating that the law would reduce the deficit by $143 billion over 10 years. Upshot: Twice last year, a federal authority that is statutorily independent from the president estimated the law would increase total national health care expenditures — pegging the impact at less than 1 percent above what would be spent on health care without the law. We don't see the projected upticks as dramatic, as Smith puts it. The actuary didn't apply such labels. We also don't see Obama acknowledging the actuary's September estimate as a shift. Then and to date, Obama has maintained the law will ultimately cut costs. We rate Smith's statement False.	None	Lamar Smith	None	None	None	2011-01-23T10:00:00	2011-01-05	['None']
pomt-07303	"The $1.8 billion in [transportation] bonding, we don’t have a repayment mechanism."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/may/18/terry-mcauliffe/terry-mcauliffe-says-virginia-has-no-repayment-pla/	Democrat Terry McAuliffe, who is considering a bid for Virginia governor in 2013, says a road-building plan passed by the General Assembly this winter is paved with peril. The former chairman of the Democratic National Committee helped launch the reelection campaign of Del. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, at a May 7 rally. During introductory remarks, McAuliffe criticized a plan to borrow $1.8 billion for transportation that Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell pushed through the legislature. "The $1.8 billion in borrowing, we didn’t even have a repayment mechanism, folks," McAuliffe said. A major borrowing plan with no way to repay the money? Is that really what the state did? We decided to check. A transportation plan to borrow up to $300 million a year for 10 years was approved in 2007. But the recession and legal challenges delayed issuance of the first bonds until May, 2010. What McDonnell and the General Assembly did this winter was accelerate the sale of those previously authorized bonds so that $600 million annually could be sold during the next three years. John Lawson, chief financial officer for the Virginia Department of Transportation, said the state still plans to issue the full $3 billion in bonds, but in a shorter period of time. Both McDonnell and Democrat Tim Kaine, who signed the 2007 plan, offered the same repayment plan. The 2007 bill directed that one-third of the state’s revenue from insurance premium taxes be set aside to pay the debt. That portion roughly equals the fraction of annual receipts from insurance premium taxes that come from vehicle policies. McAuliffe told us he knows the state has a repayment plan. He said he was "rhetorically" arguing the state lacks a plan to pay back the debt because he does not think politicians set up "a realistic repayment mechanism." He told us in an email that the state is "doubling" the amount of debt issued, but in reality, Virginia is issuing the same amount of debt in half the time. McAuliffe also said he is concerned that one-third of the revenues from the tax on insurance premiums won’t cover the state’s new borrowing for roads. He said tax receipts from premiums fell below projections in 2009 and 2010. Ric Brown, the state’s secretary of finance under Kaine and McDonnell, told us that one-third of the insurance tax will net about $131 million for the 2011 budget year that ends June 30. That’s up from $128 million in 2010, Brown said. Proceeds from the insurance tax proceeds make up about 85 percent of the Priority Transportation Fund, the state’s repository for revenues to pay off road bonds. The coffer also receives money from a state tax on the wholesale price of gas that is paid by service station owners, as well as interest on its cash balances. All told, Virginia saw $152.2 million in revenues flow into the fund during the 2010 budget year and $154.5 million is expected this year, according a briefing by Transportation Secretary Sean Connaughton to the House Appropriations Committee in January. Connaughton and Brown both say the fund will take in enough money each year to pay back the accelerated loan. Between 2011 and 2017 the state expects to deposit annual revenues of about $224.8 million in the fund. The average debt payment during those years is expected to be about $175.7 million. Those forecasts give the state plenty of leeway, even if actual revenues fall short of the projections. Let’s review. Terry McAuliffe said Virginia is taking on $1.8 billion in transportation debt without any plan for paying it back. He’s wrong. The General Assembly in 2007 set aside one-third of the proceeds from the tax on insurance premiums to pay off the debt. Taxes on wholesale gasoline also go towards the bond payments. All told, the state has set aside yearly revenues to repay the loan that are 28 percent higher than projected borrowing costs. McAuliffe is not the first Democrat to make this claim. State party chairman Brian Moran earned a Pants on Fire in January for saying the McDonnell had no plan for paying back the debt. Moran, while serving in the House of Delegates, had voted for the two bills that allocated automobile insurance taxes to transportation debt payments. By saying the state "didn’t have a repayment mechanism," McAuliffe misled voters. He admitted to us he knew all long that a repayment plan exists. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12667	"The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/20/donald-trump/trumps-false-tweet-nsa-fbi-said-russia-did-not-inf/	FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers stand by the conclusion that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election in President Donald Trump’s favor, they both said at a March 20 congressional hearing. But that’s not what Trump heard. "The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process," Trump tweeted from the official White House account, @POTUS. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com His tweet included a 51-second video clip of the hearing, which lasted more than five hours. The video clip shows Comey and Rogers confirming they have no evidence indicating that Russia altered vote tallies on Election Day in swing states like Florida, North Carolina and Ohio. But vote tallying is only one aspect of the electoral process, and it’s not the only aspect of the campaign that Comey and Rogers talked about. Comey and Rogers said they believe Russia meddled in the race leading up to Election Day, chiefly by cyber-infiltrating the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. Contrary to Trump’s tweet, they also said the intelligence community did not assess whether Russia’s actions actually had a measurable impact on the election outcome or public opinion. Because Trump sent out his tweet before the hearing ended, Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., was able to ask Comey and Rogers about it. "We’ve offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact because it’s never something that we’ve looked at," Comey said. But there’s no question from their testimony that Rogers and Comey believe that Russia wanted to influence the election: • Comey officially confirmed the FBI is still investigating Russia’s involvement in the election, saying, "I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts." • Comey and Rogers both said "yes" when Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, asked: "Both your agencies agree with the assessment that the Russians' goal was to undermine the public faith in U.S. democratic process. Is that still your assessments?" • Comey and Rogers both said "yes" when Conaway asked them if they still agreed with the intelligence community’s January conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to harm former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and, by extension, help Trump. "I don't know for sure (when we made that judgment), but I think that was a fairly easy judgment for the community," Comey said. "Putin hated Secretary Clinton so much, that the flipside of that coin was he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much." • Comey said Russia’s interference stood out because it was so "noisy," possibly in an attempt to cause panic among the American public. "They were unusually loud in their intervention," he said. "It’s almost as if they didn’t care that we knew what they were doing or that they wanted us to see what they were doing." We reached out to the White House for comment but didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump said, "The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process." Rogers and Comey never said this — not in the video clip Trump shared, nor at any point in the five-hour hearing. Rather, they said they believe Russia interfered in the presidential election, in an attempt to help Trump and undermine the democratic process. They said they don’t know one way or the other if that interference actually did affect public opinion or the outcome of the election. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-13799	"The Clinton camp was the first to get it out there and try to say there was something untoward about the speech that Melania Trump gave."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/19/paul-manafort/trump-campaign-chair-pins-melania-plagiarism-story/	Donald Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort said the most-covered story from the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention was fed to the press by Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Trump’s wife, Melania, was the headline speaker Monday night in Cleveland, but it appears she borrowed some words from a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama. Read our comparison of the two speeches here. "There’s a political tint to this whole issue," Manafort said in a televised statement July 19. "The Clinton camp was the first to get it out there and try to say there was something untoward about the speech that Melania Trump gave. It’s just another example, as far as we’re concerned, that when Hillary Clinton is threatened by a female, the first thing she does is try to destroy the person." Given the extensive media coverage of this story, we were curious about Manafort’s claim that the Clinton campaign planted it. As it turns out, the Clinton campaign was not the first to note similarities between the Trump and Obama speeches. It was Jarrett Hill, a Los Angeles-based Twitter user who describes himself as an interior designer and a journalist. "Melania must’ve liked Michelle Obama’s 2008 Convention speech, since she plagiarized it," Hill tweeted at 10:40 p.m. Monday night. Hill told PolitiFact that he was watching Trump’s speech, and a couple of the lines made him think, "Whoa, that’s weird. I heard that before." He then tweeted at some NBC journalists to draw their attention to the similarities to Obama’s speech, and the story blew up. Hill said he has "literally no ties to the Clinton campaign," though he is a registered Democrat. He has not heard from anyone involved with the Clinton campaign before or since he uncovered the potential plagiarism. Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri denied that it is the story’s source in a tweet. In fact, the Clinton campaign has not issued any statement or public response to the story, other than the tweet from Palmieri's personal account. One arm, Correct the Record, retweeted one of Hill’s tweets. A few individual campaign staffers have tweeted about it, too. But this was all after Hill made the original connection. CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz if the Democratic Party or Clinton campaign planted the attack on Melania Trump. Wasserman Schultz did not reply with a flat "no," but she said, "the Trump Organization, whether it's Paul Manafort or anyone, all the way up to Donald Trump himself, anytime they are caught red-handed engaging in distortions, inaccuracies, a fact pattern that is clearly not accurate, they blame someone else. And so they should be prepared to be held accountable for the content of anything delivered from the stage of the Republican National Convention." We tried to reach Donald Trump’s campaign multiple times but did not hear back. Our ruling Manafort said, "The Clinton camp was the first to get it out there and try to say there was something untoward about the speech that Melania Trump gave." The Clinton campaign has barely reacted to the claims that Melania Trump took some phrases from a 2008 Michelle Obama speech. A Twitter user in Los Angeles, who has no Clinton campaign ties, was the first to draw attention to the similarities between the two speeches.

pomt-05666	"More than 27,000 Rhode Island jobs depend on trade with Canada."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/18/barry-hinckley/gop-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says-27000-rho/	Benjamin "Barry" Hinckley III, the Republican candidate challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, recently criticized Whitehouse's vote in support of President Obama's decision to delay approval of the Keystone XL pipeline between Canada and Texas. The $7.6-billion pipeline would bring crude oil from oil sand deposits in Canada to American refineries and, supporters say, create thousands of private-sector jobs. In a March 12 news release, Hinckley said the pipeline would not cost taxpayers anything and would "strengthen economic ties with our ally Canada." "According to Hinckley, the impact is not just on Mid-Western construction jobs but also on jobs right here in Rhode Island," the news release said. "More than 27,000 Rhode Island jobs depend on trade with Canada, and Rhode Island sells more to Canada than to the state’s next six largest export markets combined." The debate over the Keystone pipeline extends from Alberta to Washington, D.C. But one question hits close to home: Does Rhode Island really have 27,000 jobs that depend on trade with Canada? We asked Hinckley what he based that statement on, and his campaign’s executive director referred us to a fact sheet from the Canadian government. The document’s first sentence states that "27,600 jobs in Rhode Island depend on Canada-U.S. trade." The document also features a photo of Governor Chafee and Patrick G. Binns, Canada’s consul general to New England, and mentions two Rhode Island businesses owned by Canadian firms: Ocean State Power, in Burrillville, owned by the TransCanada Corporation, and TD Bank, a subsidiary of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, which has four Rhode Island branches. And it states, "In 2010, bilateral trade flows worth $1.4 billion and 27,600 state jobs created by that trade helped to promote strong ties between Rhode Island and Canada. The state’s largest foreign market was Canada, which purchased about 30 percent of Rhode Island’s world-wide exports, more than the state’s next six largest foreign trading partners (Mexico, Germany, Turkey, China, Singapore and the United Kingdom) combined. The tourism account added another $36 million to local economies on both sides of the border." So, Hinckley’s news release quoted the Canadian government document almost verbatim. But we wondered where the jobs number actually came from. We contacted Hani Nasser, deputy spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., who said that every couple of years the Canadian government hires economists and trade experts to produce a study of U.S.-Canada trade. He said updated figures will come out in a few weeks, but he provided the latest study, which was published in 2010 and uses 2008 data. The 22-page study reports that total U.S. trade with Canada "generated U.S. output worth $470 billion in 2008." So what about jobs? "We estimate that 8 million net U.S. jobs, or 4.4 percent of total U.S. employment in 2008, depend on trade with Canada," the study says. What about Rhode Island jobs? A table provides a state-by-state breakdown, attributing 27,648 Rhode Island jobs to trade with Canada in 2008. "These jobs include those directly involved in export to and imports from Canada, as well as supporting jobs in states with little or no direct trade with Canada," the report says. And what is the source of those state-by-state jobs figures? "Authors’ estimates," the table says. The authors -- economists Laura M. Baughman and Joseph Francois, who head a consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. -- explain in the study that they arrived at those estimates using a model "commonly used to estimate the economy-wide and the sector-specific impact of trade policy changes." They say they analyzed what would happen if U.S. trade with Canada stopped to derive "output and employment" that exists only because of the trade. Then, they break it down state by state. We wondered whether anyone in Rhode Island had an actual count of jobs that depend on trade with Canada. "We don’t have data we would need to verify this," said Laura Hart, spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. But she referred to Bryant University’s Chafee Center for International Business. The Chafee Center’s associate director, A. Ray Thomas, said he knew of no such tally. But he said, "Since it came from consul general of Canada, that’s certainly a credible source." And he said, "That’s the way jobs are calculated. It’s no different than how the government estimates how many jobs are created by the federal stimulus. They use formulas." The estimate does not mean that 27,000 Rhode Islanders work for Canadian companies, Thomas said. Rather, those people might be working for companies that, for example make jewelry sold in Canada or businesses that benefit from Canadian tourists, he said. He provided a table showing that Canada is, by far, the leading recipient of Rhode Island exports, followed by Germany, Mexico, Turkey and China. Our ruling Hinckley’s news release cited almost verbatim a statistic from a Canadian government fact sheet, based on a study by economists. Hinckley didn’t mention that the figure is an estimate, rather than an actual tally.

pomt-13025	"Less than half" of jobs at the Carrier manufacturing plant in Indiana "are actually staying."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/04/heather-mcghee/did-donald-trumps-carrier-deal-actually-save-less-/	Supporters of Donald Trump have praised the president-elect for working out a deal to keep jobs at a manufacturing plant in Indiana from being moved to Mexico. Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press Dec. 4, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said the deal with Carrier, which makes heating, air conditioning and refrigerator parts, meant "more than a thousand Hoosiers have certainty in their jobs and in their futures going into this Christmas season because of the leadership of Donald Trump." Later in the show, pundits from the left and right raised concerns that painted the deal in a less twinkling light. National Review editor Rich Lowry said the government incentives involved were not ideal, and he doesn’t like Trump threatening to retaliate against businesses with tariffs for moves he disapproves of. Heather McGhee, president of the left-leaning think tank Demos, said the number of saved jobs is overhyped. "Did you actually read the Carrier letter?" McGhee asked the panel. "It started out saying ‘we are pleased to inform you’ and ended up talking about all the jobs that would still be shipped overseas. The numbers I'm looking at say less than half of them are actually staying." With so many numbers in the mix, we decided to see if McGhee’s claim had merit. McGhee was talking about a letter related to 1,400 Carrier jobs in Indianapolis. Most jobs, but far from every job, at the Indianapolis plant ended up being saved thanks to the deal with Trump's team. The outlook worsens when you factor in that plant's job losses with another Indiana plant slated for closure and owned by Carrier's parent company. The making of a promise In February, United Technologies, the parent company for Carrier Corporations, announced it would be closing an Indianapolis Carrier plant and moving its 1,400 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. Trump talked about the news throughout his campaign, using Carrier as an example of how trade deals like NAFTA have destroyed the manufacturing industry. "We're not going to let Carrier leave," Trump said in Indiana, of which Pence is governor, in April. "Because say what you want, Indiana. I've been talking about Carrier now for four months, right?" About three weeks after the general election, Carrier confirmed talks with Trump and Pence but did not elaborate. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Five days later, Trump tweeted that a deal had been struck, jobs had been saved, and his promise to Americans had been fulfilled. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The state of Indiana vowed to give the company $7 million in tax incentives over a decade, and the company agreed to invest $16 million in keeping the company in the state. While many workers celebrated saving their jobs, free-market capitalists balked, including Trump ally and Republican Sarah Palin, who described the deal as "crony capitalism." Lost in the jubilation was that hundreds of jobs at the Carrier plant would not be spared from export. On top of that, Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, said it will continue with previously announced plans to close a factory in Huntington, Ind., and move its 700 jobs to Mexico. Behind the numbers So how does McGhee’s statement add up? The best numbers available can be reasonably examined a couple ways. We could not reach a spokesperson for United Technologies for comment Sunday, so we're going by reported estimates in the Washington Post, New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, among others. The first way to add up the number — which doesn’t support McGhee’s point — is by looking just at Carrier jobs. Again, more than 1,400 Carrier jobs were heading to Mexico before the incoming administration intervened. Multiple reports put the number of saved jobs from that plant at 800 union workers, mainly those involved with building furnaces. So that’s more than half, or 57 percent, of the estimated 1,400 jobs that were slated to be lost from the Indianapolis plant. That’s a bit lower than the "more than 1,000 jobs" talking point we’ve heard from Pence, Trump and Carrier. According to CNNMoney, that total is inflated by factoring in 300 primarily administrative and engineering jobs held by parent company United Technologies that were not at risk of moving to Mexico. The letter that McGhee talked about on the show was sent to employees Dec. 1. Carrier said it would move forward with its earlier plan to relocate its fan coil manufacturing lines out of the country. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com "While this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone," reads the letter. "We are moving forward with previously announced plans to relocate the fan coil manufacturing lines, with expected completion by the end of 2017." While the letter doesn’t use specific numbers, news reports have said that the fan coil relocation will cost 600 U.S. jobs. And there’s more to the story. The incoming administration was not able to work out a deal to prevent the closing of United Technologies' Huntington factory. So 700 of those jobs will be outsourced to Mexico. So between the U.S. job losses at the factories in Carrier and Huntington, approximately 1,300 jobs will be moved to Mexico under the umbrella of United Technologies. Going by the broader view, McGhee is right that less than half (or 38 percent) of the 2,100 jobs in danger of being exported actually ended up staying. Our ruling McGhee said that less than half of the jobs from the Carrier deal actually stayed in the United States. If you just count the number of jobs at the Carrier plant, which is what Trump promised to save and what McGhee referenced on the show, then her claim is not accurate. In fact, more than half of the jobs will stay in the United States because the deal is keeping approximately 800 jobs out of 1,400 at the Carrier plant. However, her statement is correct when applied more broadly to include jobs that will be lost from the United Technologies' factory closure in Huntington, as well as the hundreds of jobs not saved in the Carrier deal. McGhee’s statement is partially accurate but needs clarification, so we rate the claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/228c9aa4-bea8-420d-b946-dd81fe8327f9	None	Heather McGhee	None	None	None	2016-12-04T18:37:47	2016-12-04	['Indiana']
pomt-06228	Says military expenditures for the United States are greater than the combined spending of the next 14 largest nations.	true	/ohio/statements/2011/dec/05/alan-simpson/alan-simpson-says-us-military-spending-outpaces-to/	Former Sen. Alan Simpson says two big obstacles stand in the way of cutting the federal deficit: the unbending rigidity of political parties and a herd of "sacred cows" in the budget. The Wyoming Republican who co-chaired the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, told the City Club of Cleveland on Nov. 18 that one of the fattest sacred cows is the Pentagon. Simpson wasn’t questioning the need for a strong military. His point was that the military budget had become so immense that it operated without restraint. To put it into perspective, he offered this remark: "Our defense budget is larger than (the combined totals of the next) 14 major countries of the world -- and if you think all of it is there for national security purposes, you're terribly wrong." PolitiFact Ohio wondered just how the numbers check out and took a look. Simpson said that simply grasping the size of the military budget challenged the Bowles-Simpson commission, and offered some examples to the City Club. "We said, How many contractors do you have in the Defense Department? and they said, 'Well, we don't know. It's quite a spread, it's between 1 million and 10 million,'" Simpson said. "When Dwight Eisenhower said watch out for the military-industrial complex, we should have listened. The ties are deep and they're opaque and there's no way to audit the Defense Department. We said, Can you give us some audit material? and they said, 'We're unable to audit the Defense Department." He said it had been a losing, bruising battle trying to rein in programs like the health care plan for working-age military retirees. "There are only 2.2 million of them," he said. "I met one the other day that had never served on active duty, had been in the National Guard the entire time and was a brigadier general. The health care plan called Tricare carries a premium of $470 a year and no co-pay and covers all dependents, he said. The annual cost to the federal government is $53 billion. To gauge where the U.S. military budget stood, PolitiFact Ohio checked the State Department's table of world military expenditures, for which the latest year posted was 2005. It was compiled from a blend of actual figures from other nations and some estimates. The United States led the list with expenditures of $503 billion. The next 14 countries had combined total spending of $403.5 billion -- backing up Simpson's statement. China was second with $85.3 billion. The United Kingdom was third, with $55.9 billion. The State Department table also listed military spending per capita. The U.S. ranked first, spending $1,700 per person. The only countries close were Kuwait ($1,670 per capita) and Israel ($1,600). Among major industrialized nations, Britain spent $925 per capita; France, $841; Germany, $458, Russia, $258; and China, $65. Some more-recent and detailed figures came from the much-quoted Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent international institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament. Its Military Expenditure Database was updated in June. It, too, is based on a combination of actual figures and estimates. It showed U.S. defense spending in 2010 as just under $700 billion, about 43 percent of the world total. Spending for the next highest 14 highest in 2010 came to an estimated combined total of $646 billion. The U.S. total was about six times that of China, its nearest rival, which was estimated at $119 billion. Among its other findings: The world growth in military spending in 2010 had its slowest annual rate of increase (1.3 percent) since a surge that began after 2001. The increase for 2010 was due almost entirely to the United States, which accounted for $19.6 billion of the $20.6 increase globally. The United States has led the global increase since 2001, with an 81 percent rise in military spending compared to 32.5 percent for the rest of the world. The 15 countries with the highest military spending account for more than 82 percent of the world total. State Department data from 2005 and more recent 2010 data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute both support Simpson’s statement: U.S. military spending is greater than the next 14 countries combined. On the Truth-O-Meter, Simpson's statement rates True.	None	Alan Simpson	None	None	None	2011-12-05T06:00:00	2011-11-18	['United_States']
pomt-10575	John McCain has said the economy is "not his strong suit."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/04/mitt-romney/mccain-said-it/	Mitt Romney touts his business and executive experience as evidence he would deftly steer the economy as president. At the same time, he blasts rival John McCain as lacking when it comes to the economy. "He has a number of things that are great strengths of his, but he happened to say the economy was not his strong suit," Romney said at a campaign stop in Denver. "Well, at a time like this in a country like this, I think it is important to have a president for whom the economy is his strong suit." Did Sen. McCain say that? He denied it at a Republican debate in Boca Raton, Fla., when journalist Tim Russert questioned him about it. Tim Russert: "Senator McCain, you have said repeatedly, 'I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated.' Is it a problem for your campaign that the economy is now the most important issue, one that, by your own acknowledgement, you're not well versed on?" McCain: "Actually, I don't know where you got that quote from. I'm very well versed in economics." It seems that Romney and Russert are both right on this point, while McCain is contradicting his previous statements. McCain gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal in 2005 in which he said, "I'm going to be honest: I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated." He told the Boston Globe in December 2007, ""The issue of economics is not something I've understood as well as I should." Russert followed up a few days later in a one-on-one interview with McCain. McCain acknowledged the quotes and gave the following response: McCain: "Okay. Let me tell you what I was trying to say and what I meant in that soundpiece. I spent 22 years in the military. I spent 20 years in the Senate Armed Services Committee. I've been involved in national security issues all my life. I attended the National War College. Of course I know more about national security than any other issue. That's been my entire life. Am I smart on economics? Yes. I was chairman of the Commerce Committee. That's why people like Phil Gramm, Tom Coburn and Warren Rudman and Carly Fiorina and the real strong economic minds, Jack Kemp, the real strong minds on the economy and conservatives on the economy are supporting me. Of course, I always have things to learn, and I continue to learn every day. But I'm very strong on the economy, and, frankly, my economic record is a lot stronger than that of the governor of Massachusetts when you look at his record as governor." McCain's explanation doesn't change the fact that he did say that economics was not his strong suit. In this instance, Romney is accurately quoting McCain's past remarks, so we find Romney's statement True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2008-02-04T00:00:00	2008-02-01	['None']
pomt-04787	"Your Congressman, Charlie Bass, took over $166,000 from Big Oil."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/aug/23/friends-democracy/charlie-bass-accused-taking-money-big-oil/	Campaign season, just like baseball season, is entering the stretch run. And, according to one political action committee, Congressman Charlie Bass is more than willing to play ball with big oil. In an advertisement released earlier this month, Friends of Democracy, a PAC pushing for campaign finance reform, accuses Bass, a New Hampshire Republican, of accepting thousands from oil and gas companies. "Your Congressman, Charlie Bass, took over $166,000 from Big Oil," a narrator says in the ad, which features three baseball fans entering a nearly empty stadium only to be told by two corporate lobbyists that their seats are taken. "If we don’t vote against Charlie Bass, middle class families will never get into the game." Friends of America, founded by Jonathan Soros, the son of noted liberal activist George Soros, is spending $700,000 to air a series of ads, which take aim at Bass and three other Congressmen, Chip Cravaack, of Minnesota, Sean Duffy, of Wisconsin and Dan Lungren, of California. We’ll leave it to other states to look into the other ads. But, are they true here in New Hampshire? PolitiFact is on the case. To start, we approached Friends of Democracy, which directed us to the Public Campaign Action Fund, a non-profit group that seeks to improve campaign finance laws. As part of its mission, the group analyzes campaign contributions for select Congressional races, according to Executive Director David Donnolly, who also helped to found the Friends of Democracy Group. In this case, the Action Fund conducted a thorough review of campaign finance data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics. The center, which tracks campaign contributions reported by the Federal Elections Commission through its website OpenSecrets.org, reports that Bass has accepted about $7.5 million in donations from PACs and individuals throughout his career. He served six terms in the House of Representatives between 1994-2006 before returning to Congress in 2010. Of that $7.5 million total, $147,660 has come from donors within the oil and gas industry, and that counts only those donations over $200, so "he’s probably got a lot more than that," said Russ Choma, a reporter with OpenSecrets. "If you give less than $200, the campaign still collects information, but it’s not broken out the same way," Choma said. "We don’t track it the same way." According to OpenSecret's calculations, the oil and gas industry doesn’t rank among Bass’ top 10 contributors. Throughout his career, independent Leadership PACs, which can accept and spend unlimited amounts of money, have donated more than $760,000 to Bass’ campaigns. Donors who listed their occupation as "retired" have contributed more than $469,000; and representatives from the insurance industry have added more than $285,000. Based on these numbers, oil and gas rank 12th among Bass’ biggest donors, and the industry’s $147,660 total falls nearly $20,000 short of the Friends of Democracy claim. Donnolly, who helped to found the group, says the discrepancy comes from further vetting the numbers. In monitoring Bass’ election, campaign fund workers reviewed all the donations tracked by the responsive politics center, including those that were not coded oil and gas. In the end, they found 192 total donations between 1994-2012 from individuals or groups associated with gas or oil companies. Together, the donations added up to $166,210, according to the campaign fund. The Center for Responsive Politics "does amazing work, but they’re tracking, in any election cycle, close to 500 races," Donnolly said. "Sometimes things fall through the cracks. … We go in and clean up the data for just the races we’re looking at." By either calculation, the ad’s numbers are on target, or at least very close. But does that make the claim that Bass took the money from Big Oil true? To answer that, we have to look at the definition of Big Oil. In its work, OpenSecrets refrains from using the term Bil Oil, referring instead to gas and oil industry contributions. The category includes a range of public and independent oil and gas producers and refiners, natural gas pipeline companies, fuel oil dealers and gasoline service stations, among others. "The definition of Big Oil is subjective," said Chera, of OpenSecrets. "We're careful to define it just as we have, as oil and gas." Still, other organizations use the term more freely. Both Friends of Democracy and the Public Campaign Action Fund consider "Big Oil" as representing the oil and gas industry on the whole, considering any and all contributions from related individuals and groups. "If someone works as an executive in the finance industry, they're often called part of Wall Street industry," said Donnolly, the action fund’s director. "These are terms to help voters understand what we're talking about." But, other industry professionals take a different view. Bloomberg’s BusinessWeek magazine, for instance, considers Big Oil to be the five or six major publicly owned gas and oil companies. "ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Shell and formerly BP have been members of Big Oil for years," according to the BusinessWeek website. "Together, they currently produce the majority of the world's crude oil supply." Under this definition, a number of the campaign contributions came from Big Oil companies, either through individual donations or through PACs established by the companies. The list includes 10 donations from ExxonMobil, totaling $24,500, as well as eight from Exxon Corp. for $4,500 and three from Mobil Oil for $1,500. ConocoPhillips contributed twice for a total of $3,000, according to the list, and other large multinational gas and oil companies donated, as well, including Chevron Corp. (once for $5,000), Sunoco (twice for $1,500), and Texaco (twice for $1,000). People connected to several oil and gas interest groups have also contributed to Bass’ campaigns, according to the list - including the American Gas Association, which contributed seven times for a total of $6,500, and the Petroleum Marketers Association (10 times for $12,750). But, nearly half of the contributions listed by the campaign fund come from donors from smaller, privately owned companies, including people affiliated withAranco Oil Company in Concord, N.H. (27 donations for $14,000), the Johnson & Dix Fuel Corporation in Lebanon, N.H. (11 donations totaling $5,850) and the Peterborough Oil Company of Peterborough, N.H. (eight donations for $4,100). "The oil industry is larger and more varied than most people outside it realize. Especially in the US, the industry has many quite small independent producers," Bob Tippee, editor of the Oil & Gas Journal, wrote in an email. "The expression ‘Big Oil’ tends to be used dismissively by people who are flummoxed by the size and complexity of an industry, that given the size and nature of the needs it serves, must be large and complex," Tippee wrote. "I don’t know anyone in the industry who uses (the term)." Our ruling: After more than14 years in office, Bass has accepted millions of dollars in campaign contributions, including, by most counts, hundreds of thousands from donors within the oil and gas industry. The Center for Responsive Politics tabs the number at about $147,000, while the Public Campaign Action Fund, and subsequently the Friends of Democracy PAC, report $166,000. Either way, the numbers are in the ballpark. What’s off-base is the claim that all the money comes from "Big Oil." Some of the contributions come from people who work forExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and the other multinational gas and oil companies commonly considered "Big Oil." But, many come from smaller firms, including locally owned heating companies and gas stations, that do not fall under the category. And as PolitiFact has noted in previous rulings, just because people who work for an industry donate to a campaign, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s coming from the industry itself. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Friends of Democracy	None	None	None	2012-08-23T16:17:04	2012-08-21	['None']
pomt-11244	"Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens. You can now shoot terrorists on sight."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/03/patriotnetworkone/headline-says-czech-republic-armed-citizens-shoot-/	An article sounding alarm bells about "Islamic Extremism" and migrants said that a new law designed to combat terrorism in the Czech Republic allows citizens to carry guns. "Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens. You can now shoot terrorists on sight," said an April 27 headline on patriotnetwork.one, a website that posts multiple anti-Muslim articles. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story celebrated what it described as a new gun policy in the Czech Republic. "Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation," patriotnetwork.one wrote. While the story said that this is "breaking" news, it actually refers to news developments several months ago. In fact, the same story appeared on multiple websites and Facebook in June 2017. While patriotnetwork.one portrayed the law as a done deal, it was only approved by one chamber of the government and so has not actually become law. Gun proposal passed one chamber in Czech Republic government In 2015, Czech president Milos Zeman called for an international military effort against terrorism and the Islamic State group. Speaking at a Holocaust commemoration forum in Prague, Zeman said such military action would prevent what he called a "super Holocaust," in which hundreds of millions would die. Zeman said in 2016 interview that Czechs should obtain guns to protect themselves against terrorists. ''If it is necessary, people will have to be ready for a situation where they will have to use those guns,'' he said. ''My wife has just got a gun license and has a proper revolver. So I hope she will protect me from terrorists.'' In June 2017, the lower chamber passed an amendment to the constitution related to the carrying of firearms. Kieran Williams, an expert in the politics of Central and Eastern Europe at Drake University, told PolitiFact that the measure would have amended a 1998 act in order to create a constitutional right to keep and bear arms to assist the state against threats to national security. The original act made it a duty to help if called upon by the state. "Czechs have long had statutory rights to keep and bear arms, and to use force in self-defense," he said. "This constitutional bill was a response to a European Union directive to tighten up possession of certain categories of weapons after the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels and elsewhere; gun advocates hoped to minimize the impact of that directive on the Czech Republic by creating this new constitutional right." The amendment passed the lower chamber in June. But it was rejected by the Senate in December when it fell short of the needed three-fifths majority. (Our Czech fact-checking friends at demagog.cz pointed us to the Senate vote.) Patriotnetwork.one makes no direct mention of the Senate, although it drew some information from a 2017 Sputniknews article that did mention that the bill still had to be approved by the Senate. The Patriotnetwork.one story is about the Czech Republic, but one of the photos the website used of an angry man appears to be the same as a 2015 photo of a man in a Budapest railway station. Few Muslims and European migrants in Czech Republic The patriotnetwork.one website tries to stir up fear about Muslims, migrants and terrorism in the Czech Republic while ignoring some facts. For starters, the Muslim population in the country of more than 10 million is tiny. The Muslim population was less than 4,000 in the 2011 census, but participants weren’t required to fill out information about their religion. That could be an undercount, but even other estimates aren’t much higher at 22,000. The Czech Republic has taken very few migrants in recent years and "has no recent history of terrorism and generally has a declining rate of violent crime," WIlliams said. Sean Hanley, a senior lecturer at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London, said most migrants entering the Czech Republic wanted to access the country to get to other countries such as Germany. There were only 1,525 requests for asylum in the Czech Republic in 2015 and at the peak of the 2014-15 crisis around 1,500 migrants were detained by the Czech authorities for entering the country illegally. Very small numbers of migrants and refugees entered compared with Hungary or Croatia. "This is an entirely unrealistic ‘threat’ but it taps into and gives a focus to the fears and insecurities of small, mono-ethnic post-communist country in an uncertain world," he said. Hanley said it "was one of the more bizarre legislative initiatives in the political history of the Czech Republic" and occurred amid a backdrop of anti-refugee hysteria. Our ruling Patriotnetwork.one said in a headline "Breaking: Czech Republic arms citizens. You can now shoot terrorists on sight." First, this isn’t breaking news -- it refers to a proposed amendment in 2017 to create a constitutional right to keep and bear arms to assist the state against threats to national security. While the amendment passed the lower chamber in June 2017, it failed in the Senate in December 2017. We rate this claim False.

pomt-04030	Odds of winning the Monopoly Millionaire instant win game are 1 in 3.27.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/01/georgia-lottery/when-it-comes-lottery-tickets-not-losing-winning/	Today could be the day! -- or so says the Georgia Lottery. Since June 1993, when the Georgia Lottery began selling tickets, bettors have waited with bated breath as chipper TV announcers called out winning Powerball numbers. Players schedule their waking lives around the twice-daily drawings for Cash 3 winnings. And ticket buyers have left mounds of scratch-off shavings on convenience store counters across the state in hopes of scoring a win. But the prize for those scratch-off games may not be the cash haul that most gamers hope for. Instead, today could be the day you win ... another ticket!. One of PolitiFact Georgia’s readers, Bob Lynn, sent us a message, questioning the lottery’s claims about the scratch-off games. Lynn’s concern was this: The lottery counts awarding another ticket as a "win." He said the face value of a ticket ("winning" $2 on a ticket you bought that cost $2, for example) is not a win. That exchange, he said, is just breaking even. It’s a draw. And more importantly, he said, by including another ticket or the face value of a ticket as "wins," the Georgia Lottery is overstating its odds of winning for each game. We decided to double-down on our lottery sources and take a serious look at the numbers game. Are these types of prizes considered "wins" by the lottery? And are the odds of winning skewed by claiming these types of prizes as "wins"? The lottery is big business for the state, with optimistic players taking chances in games with creative titles such as "Red, Hot and Wild 7’s," "Classy Loot," "Refund Check" and "Solid Gold." Since the first ticket was sold almost 20 years ago, the lottery has rung up $45 billion (yes, billion) in sales. About $14 billion has gone to Georgia’s pre-kindergarten program and HOPE scholarships for college students. On average, the Georgia Lottery offers 40 to 45 scratch-off games at any given time and has nine online, or computerized, games, according to the lottery’s website. Detailed odds for every prize level in every Georgia Lottery game are available on the lottery website, a lottery spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. The prize levels include a free ticket. The odds for each game that involves a drawing are also printed on the back of each game’s play slip. The overall odds of winning a prize in instant games are printed on every game ticket. The odds include every prize level available in each game. So transparency is not a problem. Lynn, our lottery-playing reader, has spent thousands of dollars on lottery tickets over the past two decades. He’s well aware of the odds listed on the back. One of the scratch-off games he plays, Monopoly Millionaire, for example, lists the overall odds of winning as 1 in 3.27. There are 20 different ways to win on the $10 Monopoly Millionaire ticket, according to the printed advertisement. As all gamers know, playing carries risk, he said. But "any respectable gambler knows that winning another ticket is not getting ahead. And in my opinion it’s deceitful to include these as wins." The Georgia Lottery explains it this way: There are multiple top-prize-winning tickets, as well as multiple prize levels (from free tickets to top cash prizes) available in all Georgia Lottery instant games. Players can win prizes, including cash or ticket prizes, in accordance with the rules of each instant game, said Tandi Reddick, the lottery’s communications director. David Gale, executive director of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, a lottery trade group, says claiming a ticket or the face value of a ticket as a "win" is common practice among state lotteries. And so is including them in stated odds, he said. What’s the reasoning behind this? "Gambling is defined as taking a chance with something of value, and that something can be money or a car or a lottery ticket because it is an item that has some concrete value," said Adam Goodie, the director of the Center for Gambling Research and the Georgia Decision Lab at the University of Georgia. The Center for Gambling Research, started in August 2012, is an independent facility not associated with the Georgia Lottery or any other state lottery. The CGR brings together researchers from diverse disciplines for research and continuing education and training on the diverse effects of gambling activity, according to its website. And because those tickets and face value prizes are included in the odds numbers, excluding them would indeed change the numbers, Goodie said. For example, take a scratch-off game with odds of winning listed at 1 in 3.98, he said. In other words, for every 398 tickets sold, 100 are winners. Let’s say 40 of those 100 tickets "win" their owners a free ticket. If you exclude them from the odds, a player’s chances drop to about 1 in 6 or 7, Goodie said. PolitiFact Georgia also talked to several hard-core Georgia Lottery scratch-off players. They all agreed that getting a free ticket should be considered a win. Their reasoning was a bit cynical and went something like this: You generally expect to get hosed when you play the lottery. If you don’t, due to a free ticket, you are ahead of the game. A winner. Sort of. So how do we rule on this one, and what are the odds? A Politifact Georgia reader, Bob Lynn, says the Georgia Lottery is being "deceitful" by claiming prizes of another ticket or the face value of a ticket as "wins." Claiming these prizes as "wins" overstates the published odds of winning for each game, he says. These prizes may not count for Lynn, but they sure do for lottery experts, other lottery players and the Georgia Lottery. A free ticket is considered an item of material value, and it is therefore inherently considered a prize, just like cash, a car or any other prize offered by the gaming operator. The Georgia Lottery’s stated odds printed on the Monopoly Millionaire instant game are accurate. We give the lottery a True on this one. And we wish Lynn better luck next time.

pomt-02105	"28 percent of Kentuckians don’t have any online access."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/14/john-oliver/john-oliver-says-28-percent-kentucky-internet/	Comedian John Oliver says Kentuckians aren’t getting the Senate campaign they deserve — nor one they can even follow. On his new HBO show Last Week Tonight, Oliver quipped that the race between Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Kentucky’s Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes has devolved into a battle of silly Internet memes. That’s ironic, The Daily Show alum said, because a good chunk of Kentuckians can’t even get online. "The people of Kentucky deserve everyone’s sympathy, or at least the one’s with Internet access," Oliver said. "Here’s an interesting fact: 28 percent of Kentuckians don’t have any online access, a commodity the U.N. had deemed a basic human right. Even Alaska has that number down to 18 percent and they had to lay cable through 1,300 miles of narwhal." We’re sticking to the fact-check about Kentucky’s connected population (but for what it’s worth, narwhals are not indigenous to Alaska.) Defining Internet access We reached out to a producer for Last Week Tonight for the source of the claim. She pointed us to U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2012 current population survey. The survey found that 71.9 percent of Kentuckians reported accessing the Internet either from within their home or outside the home (school, local library, etc.). That ranks 39th in the country. The inverse, then, would mean 28.1 percent in the state don’t have access to the Internet, right? Not exactly. Just because someone doesn’t have Internet, doesn’t mean they don’t have access to it. Typically, Internet "access" as a noun is discussed in terms of whether those services would be available if people wanted them. Oliver was measuring it a different way: by the percentage of people who say they actually use the Internet (as in access the verb). Each state collects data every six months on broadband availability to residents in every part of the state and sends it to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a part of the Commerce Department. That information is put together to create the National Broadband Map, which shows how connected each community is to the Internet. According to the data, 94.4 percent of people in Kentucky have access to at least Internet speeds of 3 megabits per second (we know that’s not very fast, but we’ll get to that shortly). What Oliver forgets to factor in is some people choose not to connect to the Internet, even though it is available. Why would someone make that choice? According to Census data, about half of people nationwide said they don’t have Internet because they don’t want it or don’t think they need it. Another 28 percent of people said the cost is too prohibitive, while 13 percent said they don’t have a computer at all. So, clearly for some people, access to affordable Internet is as problematic as access to Internet as a whole. But it’s hard to know for how many Kentuckians that was a factor. Need for speed Let’s get back to speed for a second, though, because this is where Oliver’s point is well taken, even if the numbers are off. Internet speed of 3 megabits per second is considered "basic." But as University of Kentucky professor Michael Childress notes, "basic level of broadband speed is no longer sufficient for many important applications," such as distance learning. In this realm, Kentuckians are at a disadvantage compared to other states, and the disparity between Kentucky and more connected states increases the faster speeds get. For starters, while getting Internet at speeds 3 mbps to 94 percent of the state seems like an accomplishment, Kentucky actually ranks 47th in the country, ahead of only Montana, Vermont and Alaska. (Side note: Given Oliver’s comments, it’s interesting to see Alaska here. Even though Oliver was right that a higher percentage of Alaskans are hooked up to the Internet at home, a smaller percentage of residents have access to the broadband grid, and that doesn’t change at higher Internet speeds.) Smaller, urban states have an easier time getting their residents access to higher speeds. In New Jersey, for example, 97 percent of the population can access download speeds greater than 50 mbps. Only 58.4 percent of Kentuckians have that luxury. Here’s a chart looking at the percentage of Kentuckians with access to the Internet at varying speeds compared to the rest of the country. Speed % of population with access Rank (50 states) 3 mbps 94.4 47 6 mbps 90.3 46 10 mbps 88.0 47 25 mbps 60.8 43 50 mbps 58.4 42 100 mbps 7.5 44 Kentucky is near the very bottom at every speed. How far behind is Kentucky at the highest speeds? The median state at 100 mbps, Missouri, still has 60 percent of its population in areas with access to Internet speeds at that level. Kentucky has just 7.5 percent. Why such a discrepancy? Childers says it’s about location. "Some households are located in rural areas where traditional broadband is simply not provided — such as many sparsely populated areas in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky." The state is working on it, though. Kentucky has received $5.3 million in grants, including from the 2009 federal economic stimulus, to help bring high-speed broadband Internet to all corners of the state. Our ruling Oliver said, "28 percent of Kentuckians don’t have any online access." When it comes to Internet speak, "access" as a noun refers to whether someone has the ability to acquire Internet. By that definition Oliver is wrong — as only less than 6 percent of Kentucky residents don’t have access to Internet at what’s considered a basic speed. What Oliver would have been better off saying is that 28 percent of Kentucky’s residents don’t access (as a verb) the Internet, which is supported by Census Bureau data. That said, Oliver is largely right in making his broader point — that when it comes to Internet access or use, Kentuckians tend to lag behind the rest of the country. The state ranks near the bottom in both percentage of people who live on a broadband grid and the number of people with Internet in their homes. While this is sad news for the prospects of a PolitiFact Kentucky branch, it helps save Oliver’s less-than-perfectly worded claim. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06231	Says the Department of Defense changed its definitions of al-Qaeda and the Taliban making it so almost anybody can be loosely associated with the groups.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/dec/04/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-defense-department-budget-changes-de/	Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul suggests it’s getting easier for the government to associate nearly anyone with two forces in conflict with the United States. Paul, a U.S. House member from Texas, said in the Nov. 22, 2011, CNN Republican presidential debate that in the U.S. Department of Defense "budget, they have changed the wording on the definition of al-Qaeda and Taliban. It's (now) anybody associated with (those) organizations, which means almost anybody can be loosely associated -- so that makes all Americans vulnerable. And now we know that American citizens are vulnerable to assassination." We took this as Paul saying a change in federal definitions of these enemy entities means anybody might end up being considered part of them. So, did the Defense Department change its definitions -- with the result Paul bemoans? Paul campaign spokesman Gary Howard told us by email he wasn’t entirely sure, but assumes Paul was referring to a section of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 that won House approval by 322-96 this spring. The Senate approved its version of the act Dec. 1, 2011, requesting a joint conference committee to reach a compromise. According to the Congressional Research Service, Section 1034 of the House measure "affirms that the United States is in an armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, and that the president is authorized to detain unprivileged enemy belligerents in connection with such conflict until the termination of hostilities." Paul objected in a May 30, 2011 "update" posted online, saying the language "explicitly extends the president's war powers to just about anybody." His commentary continues: "It doesn't matter if these associated forces are American citizens. Your constitutional rights no longer apply when the United States is ‘at war’ with you. Would it be so hard for someone in the government to target a political enemy and connect them to al-Qaeda, however tenuously, and have them declared an associated force?" Seeking context, we learned that the cited language traces to the Obama administration’s existing position that so-called associated forces already are fair game under the authorization-of force resolution approved by Congress shortly after 9/11. The 2001 congressional resolution authorizes the president to "use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons." Defending the "associated forces" language adopted this year by the House, U.S. Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon, R-Calif., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote Obama on Oct. 20, 2011, saying it was put into the act to "ensure that there would be no confusion as to the scope of authorities applicable to past and current operations." His letter adds that "our men and women in uniform are currently relying on this interpretation everyday to prosecute the war" and deserve to be on solid legal footing. A March 2009 court filing by the Obama administration regarding the detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay says the government interprets the 2001 resolution as giving the president authority to detain not only persons in or substantially supportive of the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but also individuals in or substantially supportive of associated forces "engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act, or has directly supported hostilities in aid of such enemy armed forces." Two observers of the authorization act debate, both involved in a blog on national security legal issues, told us the House-approved language codifies the legal position taken by the administration. Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that because the language reflects the administration’s existing position, it would not amount to huge change. Put another way, he said, if the language fails to pass, the administration would continue to say its approach is congressionally authorized. Wittes and Professor Robert Chesney of the University of Texas School of Law each disputed Paul’s claim that the House-approved provisions serve to make Americans vulnerable. If Paul is "implying that the standard is so broad that anybody could be at risk, that the government has discretion to label people detainable, that, I think, is nonsense," Chesney said. "There’s some overstatement here," he said, though Paul fairly points out the lack of a definition of associated forces. Still, Chesney said, it’s "preposterous to say government has the discretion to detain or even kill whoever it wants." Wittes said that under the proposed language, in order to be a vulnerable American you would have to be within an organization plausibly within the specified associated forces. "That is not a universe of zero," Wittes said, offering as an example the government’s killing of a radical cleric and U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, in Yemen. "But it’s not a large set either. To the extent the implication of his statement is the government is authorized to kill any U.S. citizen, that’s not so." Our ruling Paul’s debate warning ties to the House-approved language adding "associated forces" to the Taliban and al-Qaeda as permitted U.S. targets--not to the Defense Department’s budget, contrary to his wording. Most significantly, the U.S. government has laid claim to such authority for about a decade. So even if the cited provisions pass into law, they would not change how the government prosecutes detainees. Also, we saw no evidence that the change would make American non-combatants vulnerable. We rate Paul’s claim Mostly False. CORRECTION, 3:16 p.m., Dec. 6, 2011: This story has been amended so that Wittes is not identified as a lawyer. Our original fact check incorrectly said that he is.

pomt-12740	"According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/02/donald-trump/trump-misleads-claim-about-terrorism-convictions-9/	President Donald Trump, in his first speech before a joint session of Congress, continued to call for improved vetting of people coming to the United States, raising concerns about foreigners convicted on terror charges. "Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism," Trump said Feb. 28. "According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. … It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur." Trump’s speech came as his administration said it’s preparing a new executive order on immigration. Courts have halted the implementation of a previous order signed by the president. We wondered about Trump’s claim attributed to the Justice Department. Have the majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 been foreign born? Trump’s statement relies on an analysis put together by a congressional subcommittee then chaired by his now attorney general, Jeff Sessions. The analysis used Justice Department data, but was not issued by the department itself. That data had some limitations. Also, experts told us that most of the people convicted faced charges for threats that were not planned or carried out on U.S. soil. Many of the charges also include nonviolent offenses, such as fraud or immigration violations. Justice Department data A White House spokesperson referred us to a June 2016 Fox News report saying that of 580 individuals convicted for terrorism and terror-related cases, at least 380 were foreign-born. That accounted for convictions from 9/11 to the end of 2014. Trump attributes the Justice Department for providing information on the origin of people convicted on terrorism charges. The information came from research done by the Senate subcommittee on immigration and national interest, led by Sessions, then a U.S. senator representing Alabama. A June 2016 press release said the subcommittee received a list from the Justice Department of 580 individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses between 9/11 and Dec. 31, 2014. But neither the Justice Department nor immigration officials gave the subcommittee information on where the people were born or their immigration status. "Because the Department of Homeland Security failed to provide us with immigration information on the 580 individuals on the Department of Justice's list, we have attempted to obtain information about the immigration history for each individual using publicly available sources," said a June 2016 letter signed by Sessions and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also a member of the subcommittee. The subcommittee determined that at least 380 of the 580 individuals in the Justice Department list were foreign-born. The list provided by the Justice Department is for convictions based on investigations on international terrorism: It includes acts planned or committed outside U.S. territory but over which federal criminal jurisdiction exists, and those within the United States involving international terrorists and terrorist groups. Domestic terrorism cases with no international links are not included. "Convictions listed … involve the use of a variety of federal criminal statutes available to prevent, disrupt, and punish international terrorism and related criminal activity," the Justice Department letter said. Some may get the impression that the convictions were for terrorist attacks planned or executed in the United States, but that’s the case for only 40 of the 580 convictions, or less than 7 percent, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert with the libertarian Cato Institute. Furthermore, 241 of those 580 convictions were not for terrorism, but for identity fraud, immigration violations, or other non-terrorism offenses, he said. "Many of the investigations started based on a terrorism tip like, for instance, the suspect wanting to buy a rocket-propelled grenade launcher," Nowrasteh wrote in a post for Cato Institute. "However, the tip turned out to be groundless and the legal saga ended with only a mundane conviction of receiving stolen cereal. According to Sessions’ list, that cereal thief is a terrorist." The letter sent by the Justice Department to Sessions’ subcommittee said it included individuals whose conviction emerged from a terrorism investigation, "regardless of whether investigators developed or identified evidence that they had any connection to international terrorism." Homegrown terrorism on the rise Security experts said the bigger terrorist threat since 9/11 has come from within the United States. "Far from being foreign infiltrators, the large majority of jihadist terrorists in the United States have been American citizens or legal residents … every jihadist who conducted a lethal attack inside the United States since 9/11 was a citizen or legal resident," a New America study says. "In addition about a quarter of the extremists are converts, further confirming that the challenge cannot be reduced to one of immigration." If terrorism includes any act of violence motivated by politics, then you would include both the ideologies of al-Qaida and ISIS, as well as the ideologies of white supremacism, said David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security at Duke University. "If you look at the phenomenon of terrorism as a whole, then there are a lot of citizens committing terrorism, whether connected with foreign organizations or ideologies or domestic ones," Schanzer said. One high-profile example is Dylann Roof, who was not charged for domestic terrorism. Roof, described by authorities as a self-radicalized white supremacist, in 2015 killed nine black parishioners in Charleston, S.C. He was found guilty on 33 federal counts, including hate crimes, but not with terrorism. He has been sentenced to death. Authorities said Roof’s actions were "consistent with the concept of leaderless resistance and martyrdom advocated by white supremacy extremist groups and self-radicalization leading to violence," AP reported. Our ruling Trump said, "According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country." Saying the data came from the Justice Department is misleading. It actually came from a congressional subcommittee chaired by then-senator Sessions. Moreover, the data had some limitations. Federal agencies did not provide information on people’s places of origin. Convictions listed also included offenses committed outside the United States and nonviolent acts, such as fraud, experts told us. Finally, the data doesn't account for incidents that some might consider domestic terrorism, such as the case of Dylann Roof. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-11238	Says Bill Nelson "voted against requiring Iran to recognize Israel and release American hostages."	false	/florida/statements/2018/may/04/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-attack-mischaracterizes-vote-sen-bi/	As Florida’s U.S. Senate race heats up, Republican Gov. Rick Scott slammed Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson’s record on Iran. "While Bill Nelson voted against requiring Iran to recognize Israel and release American hostages, the following year, Governor Scott signed legislation that helped prevent state investments in Iran," Scott said in a press release April 30. For this fact-check, we wanted to hone in on Nelson’s specific votes. We found that Scott’s claim mischaracterizes the vote Nelson took and leaves out that Nelson has actually advocated for the release of hostages in Iran. Nelson and Scott will face each other Nov. 6. The vote In 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a joint resolution known as the Hire More Heroes Act of 2015. This measure aimed to encourage small businesses to hire veterans. The bill itself had nothing to do with Israel, Iran or American hostages. But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., offered up several amendments related to the Iran nuclear agreement. Often times, a member of Congress will attach an unrelated, controversial amendment in hopes of prompting debate on the amendment’s issue, experts said. And that’s what happened when McConnell proposed amendment 2656. Experts told us the amendment would have jeopardized the Iran deal by blocking the president from fulfilling the commitments the United States had agreed to unless Iran met other demands outside of the deal’s terms. Specifically, the amendment would have prohibited the president from waiving sanctions unless Iran released Jason Rezaian, Robert Levinson, Saeed Abedini, and Amir Hekmati, and formally recognized Israel as an independent state. Nelson, along with nearly every other Democrat, voted no on a cloture motion on McConnell’s amendment. The amendment ended up failing after the original amendment was tabled. Nelson’s vote was technically a vote on a procedure. But Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist, said the vote was essentially intended as a proxy for a vote on the amendment. More important than that, however, is the fact Scott’s claim mischaracterizes the substance of the vote. Scott said Nelson voted against releasing American hostages and Iran recognizing Israel as a sovereign state, but multiple experts said the amendment was really just an attempt to kill the Iran deal. "The vote was on whether to attach new conditions to the Iran nuclear agreement, thereby preventing the agreement from going forward," Koger said. Matthew Bunn, a professor of practice at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that had the amendment succeeded as intended in blocking the deal, the American hostages would almost certainly have remained in custody. He also noted that Nelson has been among the most dogged senators in pursuing the release of the fourth hostage, Levinson. Nelson met with Levinson’s family and has repeatedly called on Washington to urge Iran to release him. In 2017, Nelson led lawmakers, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who sent a letter to White House officials asking them to "maintain pressure on Iran to see that (Levinson) is returned as soon as possible." This year, Nelson cosponsored the Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act (S.2365) to impose sanctions against individuals involved in taking Americans hostage and violating the human rights of the Iranian citizens. Our ruling Scott said that Nelson "voted against requiring Iran to recognize Israel and release American hostages." The attack is a misleading stretch. What really happened in 2015 was that Nelson voted no on a cloture motion. By voting no, Nelson voted to continued debate on an amendment that experts said would have defeated the Iran deal. The amendment would have prohibited the president from waiving sanctions unless Iran released detained Americans and formally recognized Israel. But the deal was focused on the nuclear issue, not an attempt to solve major issues with Iran. Also, Nelson has worked to urge the White House to continue pressing for the release of a U.S. hostage in Iran. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01434	Says Thom Tillis "refuses to say what we should do to combat ISIS."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/07/kay-hagan/sen-kay-hagan-says-thom-tillis-refuses-ISIS/	One of the most pressing foreign policy issues -- stopping the terrorist group known as Islamic State or ISIS -- has become a point of contention in the race for U.S. Senate in North Carolina. It started when Republican challenger Thom Tillis released a TV ad accusing incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan of missing key meetings of the Senate Armed Services Committee about terrorism. Hagan then responded that Tillis has been too vague about how to respond to ISIS. One Hagan statement issued Oct. 3 said that Tillis "has ducked and dodged" when asked how he would respond and that he "refuses to say what we should do to combat ISIS." We already looked at whether Hagan missed committee meetings; we rated Tillis’ statement Mostly True. Here, we wanted to take a deeper look at Tillis’s statements on his position on how to eliminate ISIS. We found Tillis, the speaker of the North Carolina House, has offered few specifics about how he would respond. Sept. 3, no specifics: In his first debate with Hagan, when asked if the United States should "strike ISIS in Syria," Tillis said, "I think that the U.S. needs to take all actions to protect American citizens, and to protect freedom-loving people all over the country." The Fayetteville Observer noted that, "When asked if the U.S. should launch air strikes against the Islamic State in Syria following the beheadings of two captured American journalists, neither Hagan nor Tillis directly answered the question with a ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ " Sept. 10, continued air strikes: In a press release, Tillis said, "We need a strategy to destroy ISIS, and now is not the time to mince words. ISIS is an evil and dangerous terrorist organization that has proven they will murder innocent Americans … We need to continue air strikes until the president can be assured that ISIS’s own enemies in the region will eliminate them on the ground. No option should be left off the table. " Sept. 16, open to options, but concerned about arming rebels: Tillis spokesman Daniel Keylin told the Charlotte Observer that Tillis believes "no options should be left off the table to protect our national security." Keylin added that, "Even the president was against arming them (the Syrian rebels) a year ago, in part because of the risk that American weapons could end up in the hands of terrorists. Thom still has that concern today, he doesn’t want American weapons ending up in the hands of ISIS terrorists." Sept. 18, vague on arming Syrian rebels: At a campaign event in Fayetteville, N.C., Tillis declined to say whether he supports arming Syrian rebels. "We've got to know who these people are and if they go anywhere that they don't get into unfriendly hands," Tillis said. "I am not convinced those are the so-called unfriendly rebels. There's a civil war going on there, and a lot of things need to be thought out." Sept. 25, still unsure about arming Syrian rebels: In a phone interview with the Raleigh News & Observer, Tillis said he was unsure what he thought was the best course of action in regard to arming the Syrian rebels. "I actually don’t know if we should or shouldn’t," Tillis said. "I would have to know that these arms would not get in the hands of people who would want to take over the Middle East." Sept. 29, all options on the table: In a statement about a new TV ad, Tillis said, "While I support keeping all options on the table to completely destroy ISIS, the president and Kay Hagan still have no strategy and continue to lead from behind," Tillis said. Sept. 30, still vague: In an interview with FoxNews.com on Sept. 30, Tillis again repeated that the destruction of ISIS was the end goal, but gave no indication of how he would go about achieving that. "Anything short of a strategy that calls for and achieves the complete elimination of ISIS and any emerging threats is unacceptable," Tillis said. The Fox News article added that Tillis "was unclear when asked what he would do in Hagan's position. He said only that his decision would be based on what military officials told him and that as a ‘private citizen’ he could not comment on what he’d do or how he’d vote." Our ruling Hagan said Tillis "refuses to say what we should do to combat ISIS." We reviewed Tillis’ public statements on the issue and found that he has provided few specifics. The majority of his remarks do not indicate what action he would take to respond to the ISIS threat. The most specific thing he’s said is that he supported continued air strikes in Syria on ISIS, but he later broadened that to say he supported all options. And while he once said arming the Syrian rebels was reckless, he later said all options were on the table. We rate Hagan’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-01596	"McDonald’s workers in Denmark have a union. Earn $45,000/year."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/03/other-98/can-you-make-45000year-mcdonalds-denmark/	As President Barack Obama spent the Labor Day weekend stumping for a hike in the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, a Facebook message was making the rounds that made that goal look like chump change. A liberal group called The Other 98% posted an image that showed two people in McDonald’s uniforms looking utterly astonished. (The image is a screenshot from a Saturday Night Live skit.) In headline type were the words, "McDonald’s workers in Denmark have a union. Earn $45,000/year." The text in the post itself was a bit more detailed. It said, "McDonald's employees in Denmark have a union, are paid $21/hour ($45,000/year), and enjoy 5 weeks paid vacation." The post included a link to an opinion piece for Reuters from a Danish McDonald’s worker, Louise Marie Rantzau. "I work for McDonald’s and I make $21 an hour," Rantzau wrote. "An agreement between our union and the company guarantees that workers older than 18 are paid at least $21 an hour. Employees younger than 18 make at least $15." We wanted to check whether Danish McDonald’s workers are unionized and really make $45,000 a year. We found the union contract so that part is simple. As for the $45,000 a year, there are issues but if the number isn’t spot on, it’s pretty close. A 2012 annual report from McDonald’s Denmark gives some overall figures. (We used Google Translate to understand the key sections.) Nearly 4,000 Danes work under the Golden Arches, almost all, about 3,500, are hourly employees, and very few are full-time. In its report, the company bundled those part-time hours and converted them into full-time equivalents. In 2011, it paid wages of 530 million Danish kroner to what would be equal to 2,040 full-time workers. That’s different from talking about what the typical worker actually got. Still, when you do the math, the company paid the mathematically average full-time worker about $46,700 that year. Statistics Denmark is the government agency that tracks labor information. For the category of food service counter attendants, the annual pay in 2012 was over $41,000. That is for all companies, not just McDonald’s. On an hourly basis, that translates to about $20 an hour. This lines up with a survey run by two economists, Orley Ashenfelter at Princeton University and Stepan Jurajda at CERGE-EI, an economic research center in Prague. Since 1998, they have tracked hourly wages of McDonald’s workers worldwide. (They use the price of a Big Mac as a way to compare worker pay to the cost of living, as in, how many Big Macs does a person get paid an hour.) Jurajda told PunditFact that their most recent survey found Danish McDonald’s workers make about $20 an hour. The catch here is that those hourly wages only deliver an annual income of $41,000 or more if a person works full-time, and we know that most people are part-timers. We asked the McDonald’s corporation, both in Denmark and America, for the median yearly earnings. A company spokesman sent us the statement, "Our hourly rates of pay depend on the role the employee is doing and their age" Lars Esbjerg, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark, studies low-wage jobs in his country. Esbjerg said the median earnings are not publicly available, but he sent us a copy of the latest McDonald’s union contract. The lowest hourly rate is 115 DKK, or $20.70. Anyone who works after 6 p.m. or on Sundays is paid more. "Given that many will work odd hours, the full-time equivalent wage of $45,000 sounds about right to me," Esbjerg said. Trimming the pay advantage Typically, when the pay scale at McDonald’s in Europe comes up, the most common rebuttal is that people there pay higher taxes. That’s accurate, but while wages are more than double what they are in the United States, taxes are not. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American fast food worker makes about $9 an hour. Compare that to the $20.70 paid in Denmark. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average tax burden in Denmark is 38.2 percent, while in America, it is 31.3 percent. So taxes are about a fifth higher. Most people, if given the choice, would accept a 20 percent hike in taxes in exchange for making twice as much. That still doesn’t quite make it an apples-to-apples comparison because the cost of living is higher in Denmark. Both Jurajda and Esbjerg said that this also cuts into the wage advantage that Danish McDonald’s workers enjoy over their American counterparts. But at the end of the day, according to Princeton economist Orley Ashenfelter, they still come out ahead. "I'm sure that the Danish McWorkers are pretty happy," Ashenfelter said. Ashenfelter added that as a fraction of the workforce, Denmark has far fewer McDonald’s employees than does the United States. He also said that for many decades, the Danes have used wages as part of a conscious policy to reduce inequality. Our ruling The group The Other 98% said that Danish McDonald’s workers have a union and make $45,000 a year. The union membership is totally accurate. The matter of pay is true for some workers, but certainly the majority work too few hours to make that much. Still, the average numbers provided by McDonald’s Denmark, government statistics, and data analyzed by economists who have studied the earnings of Danish McDonald’s workers, generally support that figure. The post did not specifically say that all McDonald’s workers made $45,000 a year, and the broader point, that it is much better to flip burgers in Copenhagen than in Cleveland, holds up.

pomt-15197	Says 57 percent of federal spending goes to the military and just 1 percent goes to food and agriculture, including food stamps.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/17/facebook-posts/pie-chart-federal-spending-circulating-internet-mi/	Is federal spending on the military about 50 times higher than on food stamps? That’s the message of a pie chart now circulating on the Internet. The pie chart is headlined, "Look closely at this chart of federal spending." It says spending on the "military" accounts for 57 percent of the federal dollar, with other categories ranging from 1 percent to 6 percent. The caption says, "Somewhere within the tiny orange sliver at the bottom is the food stamp program that Republicans blame for our budget deficit. And so ends today’s lesson in Republican logic." To check the accuracy of this pie chart, we had to make a few assumptions. For starters, the chart isn’t dated, so we used estimated figures for fiscal year 2015. And since the chart uses some non-standard categories for federal spending, we had to make a few assumptions about which departmental spending should be placed in what category. That said, we found some fundamental problems with the graphic’s calculations and conclusions. To understand them, we’ll first provide some background on how federal spending works. Most federal spending can be categorized as discretionary or mandatory. The levels of discretionary spending are determined through the congressional appropriations process, with both houses of Congress and the president ultimately signing off on an agreed level of spending. Most spending by cabinet departments and independent agencies falls under this category, and it’s "discretionary" in the sense that if political leaders want to raise, or lower, the amount of spending for a given purpose, they can do so by tinkering with appropriations bills. The other major category is mandatory spending, which is sometimes referred to as "entitlements." Spending within this category is determined by a formula, and the big pieces are three familiar programs: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. For each mandatory program, the amount spent is tied directly to the number of people deemed eligible by age or income level. These programs effectively run on autopilot unless Congress changes the formula, making this type of spending more insulated from lawmakers and the president than discretionary spending. With that background, let’s now take a look at how the figures in the pie chart compare to a breakdown of fiscal 2015 discretionary spending (the third column), and to fiscal 2015 total spending (that is, discretionary plus mandatory spending, in the final column). Category of spending Percent listed in meme Category's share of 2015 discretionary spending Category's share of all 2015 spending (including both discretionary and mandatory spending) Defense and homeland security 57 54 16 Education 6 6 3 Veterans 6 1 4 Housing and Urban Development 5 3 1 Health and Human Services 5 9 28 State Department and foreign aid 3 5 2 Energy and EPA 3 7 1 Science and NASA 3 2 1 Transportation 3 2 4 Labor 2 1 1 Food and agriculture 1 2 4 Social Security 0 1 25 Remainder* 6 7 9 * "Remainder" includes legislative branch, judicial branch, independent agencies and departments of Commerce, Interior, and Treasury, minus offsetting receipts. The pie chart’s figures aren’t far off if you’re looking just at discretionary spending, though even here there are some differences. For instance, the pie chart significantly understates the amount of spending going to health and energy. More problematic, though, is that the pie chart ignores mandatory spending. About 60 percent of all federal spending is considered mandatory, with 34 percent considered discretionary and 6 percent devoted to interest. In other words, the chart, despite referring broadly to "federal spending," only counts about one-third of federal spending -- the discretionary part. If we look at all of federal spending, the picture changes: • The "military" share, including spending on homeland security, shrinks from 57 percent to 16 percent. • The "health" share zooms from 5 percent to 26 percent, once expenditures on Medicare and Medicaid are counted. • Social Security -- a category not even included in the pie chart now circulating on social media feeds -- rises from 0 percent to 25 percent. • Food and agriculture quadruples from 1 percent to 4 percent due to the inclusion of food stamps, a mandatory program, and agricultural income and price supports. Calculating it this way severely undercuts the graphic’s message. Rather than the federal budget being dominated by the military, the budget is actually dominated by spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. In fact. the ratio of military spending to food and agriculture spending in the full budget is 4-to-1, rather than 57-to-1. A more accurate representation would be this one: Our ruling A social-media meme says that 57 percent of federal spending goes to the military and just 1 percent goes to food and agriculture, including food stamps. To get numbers that approximate this, the pie chart cherry-picks just discretionary spending. But that means the pie chart represents only about one-third of federal spending. Once you include the 60 percent of the budget that is mandatory spending, the military share plunges from 57 percent to 16 percent, and the categories that include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid collectively account for a majority of federal spending. Spending on food and agriculture is still small, but it does quadruple from 1 percent to 4 percent. Due to its skewed methodology, the pie chart offers a deeply distorted picture of federal spending.

pomt-12113	"White supremacist who killed protester is a Democrat and visited (President Barack) Obama in Oval Office."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/21/blog-posting/story-obama-supporter-was-behind-wheel-car-charlot/	A fake news story falsely claimed that white supremacist Jason Kessler was the one responsible for killing a protester in Charlottesville, Va., in addition to meeting former President Barack Obama as a Democratic supporter. "White supremacist who killed protester is a Democrat and visited Obama in Oval Office," read the headline on an Aug. 15, 2017, post on PatriotUSA.website. We also saw it on other outlets. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to stamp out fake news. The post began by claiming Kessler, who organized the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., on Aug. 12, had been exposed as a former liberal, Occupy Wall Street protester and Obama supporter. The post included this tweet from conservative writer Dinesh D’Souza: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That part, at least, is accurate, as D’Souza’s link to the Southern Poverty Law Center showed. Kessler has said he changed ideologies near the end of 2013. But that’s about all in the story that’s true. The story said Kessler was the person accused of being "the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road." That’s not the case. Charlottesville police arrested James Alex Fields Jr. for driving his car into a crowd of liberal protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 more people. There have been several fake news stories attempting to shift the blame for the killing or suggesting Democrats were behind the protests. This attempt to put the blame on Kessler included the assertion in the post that he visited Obama in the White House in 2016, including the crude Photoshopped image at the top of this page with the story. That photo is actually a White House image from 2011, showing actor Will Ferrell visiting Obama in the Oval Office (Ferrell’s wife Viveca Paulin has been cropped out): See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com And while the story attempted to demonize liberals by drawing lines between Democrats and Nazis, the source of the story is a website that makes up its content. The post first appeared Aug. 15 on OurLandOfTheFree.com, a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we’ve debunked, attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories. OurLandOfTheFree.com said at the bottom of its home page that the site’s creators "make no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not." Its About Us page noted, "All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they’re not."

pomt-06674	The deal to raise the nation’s debt ceiling will "directly link a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts for the first time ever."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/09/jon-runyan/new-jersey-rep-jon-runyan-claims-debt-ceiling-comp/	With a recent deal to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan said he is helping to make history. About a month after voting for the bipartisan proposal, Runyan (R-3rd Dist.) distributed a mailer highlighting some of the benefits of the legislation, known as the Budget Control Act of 2011. The mailer was posted Sept. 3 on bluejersey.com, a left-leaning blog. According to the mailer, Runyan’s support of the bill will "directly link a debt ceiling increase to spending cuts for the first time ever." Fact checkers across the country have been busy investigating the same claim from other congressmen.PolitiFact reviewed a statement from Rep. Allen West (R-Florida), and PoliGraph at Minnesota Public Radio took on comments by Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). As in PolitiFact’s and PoliGraph’s cases, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Runyan is wrong. The Budget Control Act of 2011 ties debt ceiling increases to spending cuts, but that’s nothing new. In one form or another, a debt ceiling increase has been linked to spending cuts in at least four cases within the past 30 years. Drew Fasoli, Runyan’s press secretary, acknowledged spending cuts have been tied to a debt ceiling increase in the past. He said the mailer meant to say the recent deal marked the first time that a spending cut was equal to or greater than the debt ceiling increase. But we’re not going to look into that claim, because that’s not how the mailer was written. "Maybe we could have done a better job explaining it further," Fasoli said. First, let’s briefly explain the debt ceiling deal. In early August, President Barack Obama reached an agreement with members of Congress to increase the debt limit for a total of between $2.1 trillion and $2.4 trillion. The legislation also would reduce the deficit by at least $2.1 trillion between 2012 and 2021, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Part of those savings comes from the following provision: if the enactment of legislation from a new committee does not achieve the requisite estimated savings by Jan. 15, 2012, automatic spending cuts totaling up to $1.2 trillion would kick in. Those spending cuts would be spread over fiscal years 2013 through 2021. But Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, pointed to four similar cases, going back to 1985, where a debt ceiling increase was tied to spending cuts or related budget enforcement procedures. In 1985, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) Act was enacted as part of a nearly $175 billion increase in the debt limit. That act set targets to reduce the deficit. If those targets were not met, automatic spending cuts would be instituted through a process called sequestration. Referring to that act, political science professor Steven Smith of Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., said in an email: "The first time ever claim (from Runyan) is only narrowly technically correct. The debt limit increase in 1985 provided for ratcheting down the deficit, which surely required spending cuts but could have been achieved through revenue increases." Five years later, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990 also tied spending cuts to a debt limit increase. That legislation increased the debt ceiling by $915 billion, but also mandated spending cuts to help achieve nearly $500 billion in deficit reduction over a five-year period. In 1997, then-President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress would reach a similar agreement with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In addition to increasing the debt limit from $5.5 trillion to $5.95 trillion, the bill also made net reductions in direct spending of $122 billion over five fiscal years. Just last year, when federal officials approved a $1.9 trillion increase in the debt limit, they also attached a measure known as the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010. Under that act, if tax cuts or spending increases are not fully offset, across-the-board spending cuts would be made to a select group of mandatory programs. All of these examples carry the same punch line: the new deal is not the first time that spending cuts have been linked to a debt ceiling increase. "This recent August deal is nothing new," Peuquet said. Our ruling In a recent mailer, Runyan claimed the Budget Control Act of 2011 marked the "first time ever" that a debt ceiling increase was linked to spending cuts. But our research shows that similar connections have been made at least four times within the past three decades. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-03019	"Six years after unionization, 20,000 fewer children in Illinois were being served by the Child Care and Development Fund program."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/13/jennifer-parrish/hild-care-activist-jennifer-parrish-says-number-ch/	Whether independent home-based child-care providers in Rhode Island should join a labor union is a hot-button issue in Rhode Island right now. In the last General Assembly session, legislators passed a bill -- signed into law by Governor Chafee -- that requires the state to bargain collectively with the nearly 600 providers if they opt to have a union. The providers are scheduled to vote Oct. 26-30 whether to be represented by Service Employees International Union 1199. The union-organizing campaign prompted Jennifer B. Parrish, a child-care provider in Minnesota, to write an essay published Sept. 5, 2013, by The Providence Journal in which she expressed her opposition to union representation of home-based child-care providers. One of Parrish’s points caught our eye: "Six years after unionization, 20,000 fewer children in Illinois were being served by the Child Care and Development Fund program." Contacted by PolitiFact Rhode Island, Parrish said union involvement prompted child-care providers to leave Illinois’ federal- and state-financed child-care program, so fewer children were served. The providers’ resistance to paying up to $900 in annual union dues was a significant factor, Parrish contended. Parrish said dozens of licensed child-care providers in Illinois have told her that they shunned union affiliation and left the subsidized program. We had two questions: Were 20,000 fewer children being served and, if so, was the decrease related to unionization? First, a little background. Conservative and anti-union groups have vigorously opposed efforts in several states to unionize home-based child-care workers. The U.S. Supreme Court has decided to hear a challenge to the Illinois unionization law. A federal judge halted a unionization campaign in Minnesota, pending the Supreme Court challenge. In Rhode Island, unionization opponents tried unsuccessfully to delay a union vote. To check Parrish’s claim, we first went where she went, to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children & Families, which publishes state-by-state data regarding the Child Care and Development Program. We were interested in the six-year period that Parrish cited, from Oct. 1, 2005, (Illinois workers became unionized in 2006) through Sept. 30, 2011. In the 2006 federal fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, 2005, a monthly average of 82,200 children were served in Illinois by the federally subsidized program. By 2011, the figure had dropped to an estimated 63,000, a decrease of 19,200, or nearly 24 percent -- very close to Parrish’s 20,000 number. But there’s a couple of important caveats. First, the federal program counts children in all kinds of child care, not just home-based care, the focus of Parrish’s commentary. When you focus only on home-based care, the number of children served fell from 36,168 in 2006 to an estimated 27,090 in 2011. That’s a decrease of 9,078 -- a 25-percent drop. That’s a substantial decrease but it’s less than half of the number Parrish cited. And the second caveat: In addition to the unionization effort, several factors could have contributed to the drop, including changes in the rules regarding who is eligible for a subsidy. Tellingly, the number of all child-care providers in that period fell about 11 percent, while the drop in unionized home-based providers was only 3 percent. Parrish acknowledged in an interview that other factors were at play but insisted that providers’ reluctance to be union-affiliated was a significant factor. Because of the government shutdown, we couldn’t get any federal officials to discuss the figures. And neither the governor’s office nor the Illinois Department of Human Services, which oversees the child-care subsidy program, responded to our questions. Two Illinois child-care advocacy groups confirmed there were decreases in the numbers of children served, but they disputed Parrish on the reasons for the decreases. Larry Joseph, director of the fiscal policy center of Voices for Illinois Children, and Sessy Nyman, vice president of policy and strategic partnerships for Illinois Action for Children, both attributed the decreases to the economy, to a tightening of state qualifications for home-based providers, to a tightening of eligibility requirements for children, and to an increase in the co-payments for children’s parents. Joseph said he knew of no evidence linking the decrease to unionization of providers. Said Nyman: "We do lose families in a bad economy." Parents lose their jobs or work fewer hours and do not need a child-care subsidy because they are home to mind their children, she said. She called the union link "an assumption" based on political ideology. (Voices for Illinois Children and Illinois Action for Children said they count the SEIU, which represents Illinois child-care providers and wants to represent Rhode Island child-care providers, as an ally.) Our ruling Child-care proprietor Jennifer B. Parrish said 20,000 fewer children, were served in an Illinois child-care program subsidized by the federal government, after a labor union began representing child-care providers. That was very close to the decrease in the number of children served by all child-care programs. But we found that the decrease in the number of children in home-based care -- what Parrish was talking about -- was actually about 9,100. Parrish offered only anecdotal evidence that the drop was related to unionization and two Illinois advocacy groups said it was more likely caused by other factors, such as the economic downturn and tightening of state qualifications for providers and eligibility requirements for children. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, the judges rate it Mostly False.

pomt-15077	When Carly Fiorina says Hewlett-Packard "revenues went up, that's because she bought Compaq. It was a terrible deal."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/21/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-attack-carly-fiorinas-/	The second GOP primary debate became a boardroom brawl at one point, with Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina attacking each other's self-tauted records as successful business executives. Fiorina rattled off her list of accomplishments as the head of Hewlett-Packard -- doubled the size of the company, quadrupled growth and cash flow, tripled its rate of innovation -- only to be summarily dismissed by Trump. "The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster," Trump said on Sept. 16. "When Carly says the revenues went up, that's because she bought Compaq. It was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company." "Honestly, Mr. Trump, I find it quite rich that you would talk about this," Fiorina shot back, with her own laundry list of Trump’s failings as as businessman. (We address one of her claims in a separate fact-check.) Trump and Fiorina both talk up their private-sector experience as proof of presidential acumen, so we were curious about Trump’s claim that Fiorina’s business record is exaggerated. The Trump campaign didn’t get back to us. The Compaq merger Fiorina has repeatedly claimed that she doubled the size of HP, referring to the revenues created by the company. But, as Trump says and as we and other fact-checkers have noted, this growth largely stems from the company’s controversial merger with Compaq. Under Fiorina’s direction and after an embittered proxy war, HP bought Compaq for $25 billion in 2002, "a bold move" to make the two struggling companies more competitive and in a position to take on then-industry giant IBM. In 2001, HP reported a net revenue of $45.2 billion and Compaq $33.6 billion, according their Securities and Exchange Commission filings, for a combined revenue of $78.8 billion. This may look like growth but, according to experts, it’s inflated and inorganic. "Revenues will obviously go up after a merger so the real question is whether revenues grew after accounting for the combined revenues of HP and Compaq. Here, this is little to support Carly's statement," said Kartik Hosanagar, a professor at the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania. By 2004, Fiorina’s last full year as CEO, total revenues for the merged company were $80 billion. In other words, "revenues barely grew during that period," Hosanagar said. Fiorina is by no means the first executive to take credit for revenue increases spurred by a merger, pointed out Steve Morrissette, a professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. Still, he said, claiming it as growth is "disingenuous." A ‘terrible deal’ We should note that HP has not been "destroyed" -- it’s alive and kicking, but the question of the merger’s long-term impact on the company remains somewhat unsettled, even more than a decade after the deal. When the merger was published on Sept. 4 , 2001, HP stock prices plummeted, and fell again when the deal was completed on May 3, 2002. It resulted in 30,000 layoffs, Fiorina’s ousting, a low profit margin ($2.4 billion in 2004, less than 5 percent of the revenues), and lower stock prices. (Fiorina, for her part, has maintained that this is due to the dot-com bubble burst rather than her leadership or the merger.) "This was a big bet that didn’t pay off, that didn’t even come close to attaining what Fiorina and HP’s board said was in store," veteran financial journalist Carol Loomis wrote in Fortune in 2005. Dell’s CEO famously called the merger "the dumbest deal of the decade." In recent years, however, some industries watchers have come to view the merger in a better light. The Fiorina campaign forwarded PolitiFact several reports and columns hailing the deal as an ultimate boon. "Hewlett-Packard Co.’s fiscal third quarter earnings showed a decline in nearly all of its businesses, with one exception: industry standard servers, a segment area that grew in part as a result of H-P’s much-maligned merger with Compaq Computer in 2002," according to a column published in August 2015 in the financial news site MarketWatch. Among the "success" camp, however, is a substantial number of analysts who say much of the credit should go to the man who replaced Fiorina as CEO, Mark Hurd. "Ultimately, it turned out to be a good move," said Robert Burgelman, a professor at the Stanford School of Business who has studied the merger at length. "But although the logic of the merger was correct, executing it was difficult. ...Hurd accomplished what Fiorina couldn't." Still, many experts don’t buy the notion of Fiorina’s foresight or the brilliance of the merger. Morrissette of the Chicago Business School pointed out that HP is currently splitting into two companies. "Time did not show the merger to be a success," he said. "Most analysts do not consider HP a success story. The company has continued to struggle." Our ruling Trump said, "When Carly says the revenues went up, that's because she bought Compaq. It was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company." Though the HP-Compaq merger was almost universally condemned at the time the deal took place, time has made the merger look better in the minds of some. But there’s no question that the growth in HP’s revenue did indeed come from its 2002 merger with Compaq. That means it’s not organic growth, but rather merely due to increase in the volume of the combined company. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06034	"The Republicans have never done anything really to balance the budget."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/13/steve-cohen/have-republicans-never-done-anything-really-tame-n/	With Congress tied in knots about the massive federal debt late last year, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen wasn't shy about pointing fingers. Now at more than $15 trillion, the debt is the result of many policies and actions -- by Republicans and Democrats alike -- but Memphis’s Democratic congressman took the opportunity to cast Republicans as the main villains and his own party as courageous leaders fighting to balance the budget. Appearing as a panelist on an MSNBC program hosted by liberal political reporter Chris Hayes, Cohen said: "Democrats have dealt with the deficit before. In 1993, all Democrats balanced the budget or put it on the way to being balanced. And the Republicans have never done anything really to balance the budget. They’ve had two wars off budget, Afghanistan and Iraq. They’ve put these Bush tax cuts in effect. That’s the reason we’ve got this great deficit." Cohen offers some specifics to back up his claim. But the core statement here, that Republicans have never done anything to balance the budget, immediately struck us as an overreach. Never? Not even once? Stephen Ellis, vice president for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a non-partisan group that opposes wasteful spending, got right to the point in an email reply: "Both parties can lay claims to doing things to balance the budget, and both parties can be blamed for doing things that made the budget more out of balance." Cohen is correct that in 1993, not one Republican voted in favor of President Clinton’s budget reconciliation act that reduced the deficit mainly by raising various taxes – a move many Republicans predicted would lead to economic disaster. Cohen was also careful in the segment to distinguish that the 1993 act put the budget "on the way to being balanced." But getting to a balanced budget – and eventually creating a surplus – required more than just unilateral Democratic actions and leadership. Indeed, we found plenty of examples of other Republican actions to reduce the deficit: A Wall Street Journal news article on Aug. 1, 1996, attributed the shrinking budget deficit partly to that 1993 deficit-reduction package and largely to "a stronger-than-expected economy." Also, it says, "spending cuts engineered by the Republican Congress," deserve credit but "to a lesser extent." The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the product of a Democratic president and a Republican Congress, also deserves credit, said says Marc Goldwein, policy director for the New America Foundation’s Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "In the '90s, it’s clear there were many cases where Republicans worked to balance the budget," Goldwein said. The liberal columnist and blogger Jonathan Chait is among those who question whether the 1997 act actually lowered a deficit that was projected to become balanced even without the legislation. Essentially, he says, Republicans traded with Clinton, getting cuts in capital-gains taxes for the wealthy in exchange for giving Clinton a childrens’ health insurance program. Chait also points to research by Michael Linden of the left-leaning Center for American Progress that shows "legislation passed by the Republican-led Congress of 1995 through 1997 combined to actually worsen the fiscal situation – albeit slightly." But even Chait acknowledges that a Republican president’s budget deal deserves as much -- or more -- credit with leading the nation toward a balanced national budget: "George H.W. Bush's 1990 budget did even more to reduce the deficit." At the time, Bush was attacked from the right for compromising with Democrats, trading small tax increases on the wealthy for spending reductions. Among the measures to impose fiscal discipline: Caps on discretionary spending and an innovation called PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) that required future Congresses to pay for any tax cuts or spending increases with corresponding tax increases or cuts in spending (that provision expired in 2002). Ultimately, only 10 Republican members of the House and 23 Republican senators supported that deal -- but they were Republicans nonetheless, acting at the behest of a Republican administration. "Obviously the ‘never’ is inaccurate because we could go back to Herbert Hoover," Goldwein, of the New America Foundation, said. When we asked Cohen about this, he stood by his statement and continued to focus on Republican actions taken (or not taken) in the 2000s, when President George W. Bush had a Republican House and Senate. He cited the Bush tax cuts, the "off budget" wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (the war costs were included in a "supplemental appropriation" every year), the Medicare Part D prescription drug program and lax financial regulations. However, on all of the above, Republicans received support from more than a few Democrats. Cohen also said he doesn’t believe Republicans should receive credit for just proposing ideas on ways to reduce the deficit, such as House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan’s 2012 budget resolution that contained trillions of dollars in spending cuts. More recently, Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, joined forces with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., on a plan to reduce the deficit by allowing seniors to choose between traditional Medicare and private insurance plans. "But they haven’t done anything, really," Cohen said. "They haven’t passed any bills, have they?" Our ruling Cohen so deeply believes Republicans are to blame on the budget deficit he even, on the MSNBC show, brought up the story "about the child who kills his parents and has the great chutzpah to say I’m an orphan and you should feel sorry for me – that’s the Republicans saying look at the deficit." But if Cohen is going to use the wayback machine to travel to 1993, he can’t then ignore what happened under the first President Bush and the Republican Congress of the mid-'90s. Cohen’s strong feelings and unapologetic liberal leadership have helped him win landslide elections and extremely high approval ratings, but in this instance his partisan passion led to a statement not supported by facts. Republicans have done things that would lead to a balanced budget, at present and in the not-so-distant past. We rate this statement Pants On Fire.

pomt-07689	State employees will have to pay 100 percent of their pensions and health insurance after 2012.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/08/chain-email/e-mail-says-state-employees-wisconsin-will-have-pa/	Rumors of dire consequences for state employees flew the morning after Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced deep cuts in the 2011-’13 state budget. Employee angst centered on fears of new financial sacrifices -- beyond Walker’s previously announced proposal that state workers pay 50 percent of their pension costs and a bigger chunk of health insurance premiums. Department of Corrections employees in the Racine area openly fretted in an e-mail they forwarded to co-workers, families, friends and fellow union members. Citing specific pages in the budget repair bill, the email said a major surprise awaited employees after 2012. "Page 58 Sec 62.623 -- In 2013 the state will NO LONGER PAY ANYTHING toward our medical and pension fund. The state employees will be required to pay the entire cost, roughly $1500.00 a month for each employee." That would mean about $18,000 a year. The e-mail reflects concerns on the tips of employees' tongues for weeks, said Matt Stohr, spokesman for the state Department of Employee Trust Funds. "Every day it seems there is another rumor to react to," Stohr said. The e-mail was forwarded to us by one of its recipients, Corrections employee Catherine Weishan. Weishan said it alarmed her because taking on the full cost of health insurance and pensions would mean payments from employees of well into five figures each. "If this is true, and especially if the $1,500 estimate is true, then I cannot afford to keep my job with the state," Weishan said. "When I came to work for the DOC I took an hourly pay cut and, like many, expected to do so in return for benefits. If my benefits become unaffordable, in particular the health insurance, I need to find a job with insurance that I can afford." Given the widespread rumors, we thought it was worth getting to the bottom of this one. After all, the stakes are high -- health premiums alone average $14,700 per state employee. In 2010, the state picked up $997 million of the cost while employees kicked in $60 million, Stohr said. The email Weishan received had some odd cut-and-paste qualities. It mixed in references to two different Walker proposals -- his 2010-'11 budget-repair bill introduced in mid-February, and his 2011-'13 budget released March 1, 2011. At times it confused the two. So, is there any truth to its claim that state workers, after 2012, will have to pay the entire cost of health premiums and pensions? In a word, no -- at least based on what we know now. We could find no evidence of such a plan in our review of the two bills. Under Walker’s plan, the state could unilaterally set the worker contribution at any amount. And if costs rise, that would mean more out of pocket from employees. But there’s no indication in the bills of a plan to go to 100 percent employee share -- nearly eight times the contribution Walker is seeking in his plan. Two state officials, Stohr from the Employee Trust Funds department and Gov. Scott Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie, said there was absolutely nothing to the claim. "No truth to it," Werwie said of the e-mail claim. Said Stohr: "I haven’t seen anything like that in the budget." The claim appears to be a misreading of the budget-repair bill. The section on page 58 of the budget-repair bill -- the part cited in the email -- actually refers to City of Milwaukee employees, not state employees. Walker’s repair bill makes this pension change for state employees, city and county of Milwaukee workers and other local employees covered by the state pension system. The page in question outlines how City of Milwaukee employees will have to pay half of the pension contribution required annually. In Milwaukee that translates to 5.5 percent of salary for general city employees and 7 percent for elected officials. We confirmed those points with Dennis Yaccarino, a manager in the City of Milwaukee budget office. Where does this leave us? A chain e-mail makes various claims about how state employees will suffer under Walker’s two budget bills. Those claims go way beyond the governor’s actual plan to get state employees to share more of the cost of pension and health insurance. We could find no evidence to back the e-mail’s claim that employees will pay 100 percent of their benefits as of 2013. State officials flatly deny it as well. That rate the claim False.

pomt-13457	Says the Donald J.Trump Foundation's money "is his money."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/14/kellyanne-conway/no-donald-trumps-foundation-money-does-not-come-hi/	Donald Trump is facing questions about the work of his personal foundation. Campaigning for Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama accurately said Trump’s charity purchased a six-foot-tall painting of himself. A day before Obama’s speech, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway touted Trump’s altruism in an interview with CNN’s Alisyn Camerota: Conway: "Donald Trump has been incredibly generous over the course of his life." Camerota: "With his own money?" Conway: "With his own money, and his foundation's money — which is his money." Camerota: "No, the foundation's money are other people's. Conway: "Okay. He's been incredibly generous. I mean, are we going to actually question -- Hillary Clinton and her husband made almost a quarter of a billion dollars and we're supposed to just question -- and that's okay." Conway made a point to tell Camerota and viewers that the Donald J. Trump foundation’s money comes from Trump. But that’s at odds at reporting we’ve seen, so we wanted to take a deeper look. Trump has yet to release his tax returns or provide evidence of his charitable giving, so it’s impossible to know how much he’s directly donated. The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold has been trying to track down Trump’s donations for months with little success. Fahrenthold has determined, however, how much money Trump has donated to his foundation by reviewing the foundation’s IRS documents. Based on his reporting, Conway’s claim is inaccurate. "Donald J. Trump Foundation is Trump’s money, his campaign manager says. No," Fahrenthold wrote in a Washington Post article. We reviewed the Trump Foundation Form 990s ourselves and verified Fahrenthold’s conclusion. From 1987, when Trump created the foundation to donate some of his Art of the Deal proceeds, to 2006, Trump was its main contributor. In those three decades, his gifts averaged about $250,000, with the largest one reaching $1 million in 1989. In 2007, Trump gave $35,000, which accounted for about 0.9 percent of the total donations received that year (World Wrestling Entertainment alone gave $4 million). In 2008, he gave $30,000. And then he stopped giving altogether. Here are two charts showing how Trump’s donations to his foundation compare to others’ gifts: What about the possibility that the money the foundation currently has still belongs to Trump? Fahrenthold told us that doesn’t add up. "Trump Foundation began 2007 with just $4,238 in the bank. That wasn’t all Trump’s money, but for the sake of argument let’s assume it was. Since then, the available tax records show Trump has given just $65,000, and nothing since 2008. Other donors have given $8.9 million in that time, covering 2007 to 2014," he said. By 1995, a year after the foundation received its first non-Trump donation, the Republican nominee’s own money actually stopped being enough to cover his foundation’s charitable giving. And by 2014, the Trump Foundation had given a total of $13.5 million dollars while Trump himself had given it a total of $5.4 million. It’s possible that Trump gave more of his own money to the foundation in 2015 and 2016, but the tax forms for those years are not yet available. Fahrenthold told us he’s asked the Trump campaign for clarification but hasn’t received a response. We asked as well and haven’t heard back. The ruling Conway said the Donald J.Trump Foundation's money "is his money." That may have been accurate several years ago, but no longer. Tax records show Trump hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008. We rate Conway’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e0381608-a288-4546-ae4a-14d929bc262d	None	Kellyanne Conway	None	None	None	2016-09-14T16:31:49	2016-09-12	['None']
pomt-06367	"Because of Barack Obama the mission in Iraq ended."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/03/barack-obama/ad-says-obama-reason-iraq-pullout/	It’s not exactly like George W. Bush’s "mission accomplished" moment, but President Barack Obama is declaring victory of sorts. A campaign ad touting four of Obama’s accomplishments as president includes this assertion: "Because of Barack Obama the mission in Iraq ended." Given the boldness of the statement, we decided to look further. Ending the mission The day Obama took office in January 2009, he summoned Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and top military leaders to the White House, held a closed-door meeting and then issued this statement: "During the discussion, I asked the military leadership to engage in additional planning necessary to execute a responsible military drawdown from Iraq." It marked the fulfillment of a campaign promise Obama made to end the war, directing military leaders to begin withdrawal. About 18 months later, he declared that the American combat mission in Iraq was ending. When we asked the Obama campaign to provide the basis for the ad, they cited this announcement. "Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country," Obama said in a televised Oval Office address on Aug. 31, 2010. "This was my pledge to the American people as a candidate for this office." PolitiFact gave Obama another Promise Kept for that milestone. Obama said 50,000 troops would remain in Iraq, focusing on "supporting and training Iraqi forces, partnering with Iraqis in counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilian and military efforts." He said those remaining forces would leave by the end of 2011. Which brings us to his announcement in October 2011 that all U.S. troops would depart Iraq before Christmas. "Today, I can report that, as promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year," Obama said at the White House. "Our troops will definitely be home for the holidays." A small force of a few hundred Marines will remain to help train Iraqi forces, as well as a large diplomatic contingent. The war pre-Obama Despite the goals Obama met, most of the timetable for leaving Iraq was in place before he took office. The prevailing document, the 2008 Status of Forces Agreement, was negotiated between the Bush administration and the Iraqi prime minister Nuri al-Maliki. That’s what set the deadline of Dec. 31, 2011, for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq. "He essentially implemented the plan that he inherited," said Chris Preble of the libertarian Cato Institute. James Carafano, of the conservative Heritage Foundation, compared Obama taking credit to saying "because of Truman we were victorious in World War II, without mentioning Roosevelt." Even when the deadline was set, news reports say, it was considered somewhat soft -- more a political symbol establishing Iraq’s sovereignty than a concrete date. The Obama administration held to that line and planned to keep several thousand troops in Iraq beyond 2011 as a "residual force." Administration officials negotiated with Iraqis all year to amend the withdrawal plan. The breakdown: immunity for American troops in Iraqi courts. The Iraqi parliament refused to approve it, and American officials wouldn’t leave U.S. forces in place without it. "When the Americans asked for immunity, the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible," al-Maliki said in an October news conference. "The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped. Now that the issue of immunity was decided and that no immunity to be given, the withdrawal has started." But Obama didn’t spin the withdrawal that way. He portrayed it as another fulfillment of a campaign promise. Michael O’Hanlon, with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, has written favorably about Obama’s policies in Iraq. But he said the planned troop pullout is no victory. "He did a good job of making the transition to where we are now gradual and careful. He took credit for that in his August 31, 2010, speech and he deserved to," O’Hanlon said. "But what’s happened these last couple weeks has been regrettable. Not primarily Obama’s fault. But not a success and not something to take credit for at this moment." Said Carafano: "It’s absolutely a face-saving thing." Politically though, Obama may be making a wise calculation. "My speculation would be that they’ve concluded that the public will support the pullout," said Preble. "The polling on this is just overwhelming. There are very, very few Americans who want U.S. forces to remain in Iraq." "It’s not a great campaign speech to say, ‘negotiations failed so we’re taking credit for pulling out,’" he added. "It appears that they’re trying to put a positive spin on what others have attempted to cast as a setback or a failure. It’s only a failure if you think we should keep troops in Iraq." A real withdrawal? What remains in Iraq are thousands of federal contractors, diplomats and a huge American embassy in Baghdad. And don’t forget the tens of thousands of American military stationed just over the border of Iraq in places like Turkey and Kuwait. Said Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Oct. 26, 2011: "We will maintain a long-term relationship with Iraq. And we will have, as you know, a long-term presence in that area. We've got over 40,000 troops in that region, just 23,000 alone in Kuwait. So we are going to be there." "I suppose you could make an argument that we’re just going back to the status quo," said Carafano, referring to the time before the invasion of Iraq in 2003. We should note that the Obama campaign said the ad we were checking had a word missing -- that "the mission in Iraq" should say "the combat mission in Iraq." They revised the ad and sent it to us: Our ruling The Obama campaign ad (the original one) said "Because of Barack Obama the mission in Iraq ended." It’s true that the president held steadfast to his promises of ordering military leaders to end the war, halting combat operations and finally bringing the remaining troops home. But those benchmarks were put in place by a previous president. Obama, when he took office, could have steered the operation in a different direction, amping up the military force in Iraq or pledging a long-term presence there. But he adhered to the blueprint, including trying to extend the withdrawal deadline. Only when that failed because of the immunity question did Obama announce -- and take credit for -- the full withdrawal. It was a savvy political move maybe, but not a totally forthright statement. Also, the U.S. mission in Iraq will be continued to a large extent by contractors and diplomats. Therefore, we rate it Half True.

pomt-09210	Rick Scott "was forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud, including 14 felonies, leading to a historic $1.7 billion fine."	true	/florida/statements/2010/may/20/alex-sink/rick-scott-healthcare-ceo-faces-questions-a/	With Republican Rick Scott pouring millions of dollars into his unconventional bid for governor, the front-runners from both major parties are beginning to take his candidacy seriously. Translation: They're attacking him. Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum and Democratic Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink are launching new criticisms against Scott and his former hospital company, Columbia/HCA. "If Scott proposes the same accountability measures for Florida government that he used at Columbia/HCA, we'll have to back up the paddy wagon to the front door of the Capitol," Sink spokeswoman Kyra Jennings said in a May 18, 2010, press release. "Florida simply can't trust someone who was forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud, including 14 felonies, leading to a historic $1.7 billion fine." Hours later McCollum campaign manager Matt Williams offered a second stinging critique. "The fact that Rick Scott is running for governor as a 'reformer' would be funny if it wasn't so outrageous," Williams said. "This is a man who barely escaped imprisonment, whose failure in business has been portrayed on national news and around the world. He is an embarrassment." We're going to be checking statements from both campaigns. We'll start with Sink's claim that Scott "was forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud, including 14 felonies, leading to a historic $1.7 billion fine." On his campaign website, Scott admits HCA has paid $1.7 billion in fines as part of a federal settlement concerning fraudulent health care billing, so there's not much point in checking that. But we hadn't heard the claim that HCA pleaded guilty to 14 felonies. Scott started what was first Columbia in the spring of 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. In 1994, Scott's Columbia purchased HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies to form Columbia/HCA. When Scott resigned as CEO in 1997, Columbia/HCA had grown to more than 340 hospitals, 135 surgery centers and 550 home health locations in 37 states and two foreign countries, Scott's campaign says. The company employed more than 285,000 people. Now, about why Scott left Columbia/HCA in 1997. That year, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. The scope of the investigation at first was unclear; even Scott said he didn't know what the U.S. Justice Department was looking for. But it later became apparent that the investigation focused on whether Columbia bilked Medicare and Medicaid. Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public and before the level of fraud became known. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy. Was he forced out as Sink claims? It's hard to tell. We don't know what happened in Columbia's board of directors meeting back in July 1997. So we have to go on news accounts from that time. USA Today put it this way: "Under pressure from his board of directors, Columbia CEO Richard Scott quit Friday." The St. Petersburg Times: "The top two executives at Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. resigned Friday under pressure from an increasingly hostile board." Other articles used the words "amid pressure," or "ousted" to describe Scott's departure. Scott campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said Scott left Columbia/HCA over a disagreement on how to handle the fraud investigation. "There was a disagreement on how to move forward in light of the investigation and he and the company parted ways," Baker said. "The board wanted to settle the fines and Rick took the position that the courts ultimately did, which was that there could be honest disagreement over how the regulations were interpreted." In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced what it called the largest government fraud settlement in U.S. history when Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement: Columbia billed Medicare, Medicaid, the Defense Department's TRICARE health care program, and the Federal Employees' Health Benefits Program for lab tests that were not medically necessary or not ordered by physicians; The company attached false diagnosis codes to patient records in order to increase reimbursement to the hospitals; The company illegally claimed non-reimbursable marketing and advertising costs as community education; Columbia billed the government for home health care visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them. The government settled a second series of claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The claims were largely related to additional allegations of fraud. The combination of the two settlements is how Sink, Scott and others reach the $1.7 billion figure. But none of that speaks directly to the fact cited in the Sink statement, that HCA pleaded guilty to 14 felonies in connection with the fraud case. The Sink campaign referred us to a December 2002 New York Times article. Indeed, the article said that in 2000 the hospital chain agreed to plead guilty to 14 separate felonies. But that's an article talking about a 2000 event. There were no stories from 2000 that referenced Columbia/HCA and 14 felonies. So we went to the Department of Justice looking for help. There we unearthed the original press release. Dated Dec. 14, 2000, the release highlights the record $840 million settlement agreed to between HCA and the Department of Justice. "Health care fraud impacts every American citizen. When a company defrauds our nation's health care programs, it takes money out of the pockets of the American taxpayers. It is wrong," then-Attorney General Janet Reno said in the release. "This investigation has been the largest multi-agency investigation of a health care provider ever undertaken by the U.S. and reflects our commitment to vigorously pursuing all types of health care fraud schemes." The release spells out the settlement, including specific payouts. It also details deals in the settlement of pending criminal cases. From the release: Southern District of Florida (Miami) -- Columbia Homecare Group Inc., a subsidiary of Columbia, will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and to violate the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute involving its fraudulent business in the purchase and operation of home health agencies and fraudulent billing of Medicare for management and personnel costs. The criminal fine is $3.36 million; Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta) -- Columbia Homecare Inc. will plead guilty to one count of violating the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute related to purchase of home health agencies. The criminal fine is $3.36 million; Department of Justice Criminal Fraud Section -- Another subsidiary, Columbia Management Companies Inc., will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and to make and use false writings and documents in connection with its fraudulent "upcoding" of bills to Medicare for patients diagnosed with certain types of pneumonia. The criminal fine is $27.5 million. This investigation was based in Nashville, Tennessee; Middle District of Florida (Tampa) -- Columbia Homecare Group will plead guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the U.S. and one count of conspiracy to violate the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute in connection with the purchase and operation of home health agencies. The criminal fine is $8.4 million. Also, Columbia Management Companies will plead guilty to eight counts of making false statements to the U.S. in connection with the submission of false cost reports to Medicare. The fine amount is $22.6 million; and, Western District of Texas (El Paso) -- Columbia Homecare Group will plead to a conspiracy to pay kickbacks and other monetary benefits to doctors in violation of the Medicare Anti-kickback Statute. The criminal fine is $30.1 million. A couple of important notes. The actual plea deals were arranged with HCA subsidiaries and not the hospital chain itself. That was done so HCA could continue to participate in the Medicare program. Also, all of the charges deal with corporate criminal liability. Scott wasn't charged individually, and the plea deal was struck after Scott already had left the company. Secondly, we noticed how the discussion regarding the El Paso charge was different than in the other four jurisdictions. But based on the size of the fine, $30.1 million, we feel safe assuming there was at least one count agreed to as part of the settlement. Adding that in with the others indeed adds up to 14. In interviews, Scott accepts responsibility for the problems at Columbia/HCA, but denies direct knowledge of the fraud. "There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient,'' Scott told the St. Petersburg Times this month. "I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader." In its claim, the Sink campaign says Scott "was forced to resign as the head of a company that pled guilty to massive amounts of systematic fraud, including 14 felonies, leading to a historic $1.7 billion fine." Scott's former company, Columbia/HCA, did plead guilty to 14 felony charges stemming from a massive federal fraud investigation, and Scott himself admits the company wound up paying $1.7 billion in fines. Whether Scott was forced to resign or not is something of an HR employment trick, but media accounts certainly suggest the company's board of directors was under pressure from shareholders to shake things up. That's enough to rate Sink's claim True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-05-20T18:36:45	2010-05-18	['None']
pomt-05801	"When I was born, defense spending was 60 percent of the budget. It's now 17 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/23/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-defense-spending-has-fallen-195/	During the Feb. 22, 2012, presidential debate in Mesa, Ariz., Rick Santorum offered some historical comparisons of the federal budget. "When I was born" -- which was 1958 -- "less than 10 percent of the federal budget was entitlement spending. It's now 60 percent of the budget. Some people have suggested that defense spending is the problem. When I was born, defense spending was 60 percent of the budget. It's now 17 percent. If you think defense spending is the problem, then you need a remedial math class to go back to." We’ll split these claims into two separate items. Here, we’ll look at whether in 1958, "defense spending was 60 percent of the budget. It's now 17 percent." We turned to data from the Office of Management and Budget. OMB provides historical figures for breaking down federal spending. In 1958, the percentage of the federal budget going to national defense was 56.8 percent. That’s pretty close to what Santorum said. In fiscal year 2011, the percentage was 19.6 percent, which is also somewhat close to what Santorum said. This trend is not too surprising, since entitlement spending has grown dramatically since 1958. Defense spending has also declined as a percentage of gross domestic product, though not as dramatically as it has when measured against the overall budget. In 1958, defense spending accounted for 10.2 percent of GDP, compared to 4.7 today. However, in inflation-adjusted dollars, U.S. spending on defense has actually increased significantly. In 1958, the U.S. spent the equivalent of $371 billion, compared to $612 billion in 2011. If you subtract war funding in 2011 -- since the U.S. was not involved in overseas combat in 1958 -- the figure was still higher in 2011, at about $497 billion, said Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Our ruling As his benchmark, Santorum chose defense spending as a percentage of the federal budget. He could have chosen other measures, such as defense spending as a percentage of GDP or annual spending in inflation-adjusted dollars, and they would have showed different patterns. But we think the measurement is credible, and his choice of it is reasonable. Because his numbers are close, but not exact, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-07221	"We're going to be looking at $8 billion a day that we're going to be pouring into foreign countries in order to import that make-up fuel that we're going to need to take the place of what we could have gotten out of the gulf."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/03/sarah-palin/palin-claims-loss-gulf-oil-production-gulf-will-co/	In an exclusive interview with Fox News' Greta Van Susteren on board her "One Nation" bus tour, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said there will be a steep price to pay for President Barack Obama's decision to place a temporary moratorium on new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. "The impacts of that moratorium, where 97 percent of our offshore has been locked up...what we're looking at now is 150,000 barrels per day less next year, and 200,000 barrels per day less being able to be developed from the gulf the year after because the moratorium disallowed the permitting process, disallowed rigs to be able to, economically speaking, stay in the gulf. They moved out," the former Republican vice presidential candidate said in the May 31, 2011, interview. "So we're going to be looking at $8 billion a day that we're going to be pouring into foreign countries in order to import that make-up fuel that we're going to need to take the place of what we could have gotten out of the gulf." In a separate item, we looked at Palin's claim that the moratorium caused a projected drop in Gulf of Mexico oil production of 150,000 barrels a day this year and an additional 200,000 barrels a day next year (a claim we rated Barely True). Here we're going to tackle Palin's claim that because of a decrease in oil production from the moratorium, the U.S. is "going to be looking at $8 billion a day that we're going to be pouring into foreign countries in order to import that make-up fuel that we're going to need to take the place of what we could have gotten out of the gulf." As we mentioned in our accompanying fact-check, Palin's figures on declining Gulf of Mexico oil production were high, but close. According to the government's Energy Information Administration short-term energy outlook report from May 2011, oil production from the gulf is projected to dip by 130,000 barrels a day this year and another 190,000 barrels a day in 2012. (It is inaccurate, however, for Palin to attribute the entirety of the drop to the moratorium, but for more on that, see our accompanying fact-check). We're not sure exactly how Palin came up with her $8 billion a day figure. Palin's political action campaign did not respond to our inquiry about the figure she used. But some simple math shows she is way off. According to the latest projections (May 2011) by the EIA, the government agency that keeps track of energy statistics, imported oil is expected to cost $104.58 per barrel in 2011 and $108.12 per barrel in 2012. Let's assume demand stays constant and that any drop in domestic production is met with an equal, additional purchase of imported oil. So a drop in oil production of 130,000 barrels a day in the Gulf of Mexico in 2011 would mean the purchase of an additional 130,000 barrels a day from imports. That comes to $13.6 million a day. But that's just 2011. The total projected drop in oil production in the gulf between 2010 and 2012 is 320,000 barrels per day. At projected 2012 prices ($108.12 per barrel), that comes to $34.6 million a day. So Palin's number of $8 billion a day is way, way off. One other EIA statistic adds further perspective. According to the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook report (Table A11.) issued on April 26, 2011, the "net import share of liquid fuels" (the percentage of fuel we get from imports) is expected to steadily decline over the next 25 years; from 52 percent in 2009; to 49 percent in 2015; and eventually down to 42 percent in 2035. In other words, the EIA -- in a report prepared after the moratorium -- projected that our reliance on imported oil is expected to decrease over the long haul. Palin is correct that the moratorium caused a dip in Gulf of Mexico oil production. But she overstated the amount of the dip attributable to the moratorium, and she grossly overstated the cost of that dip if a similar mount of oil is purchased from foreign sources. By the most generous accounting, the cost of that dip in oil production and the substitution of imports comes to a little less than $35 million a day. Palin said $8 billion a day. That's way off.

pomt-15043	Honduras "bans citizens from owning guns" and has the "highest homicide rate in the entire world." Switzerland, with a similar population, "requires citizens to own guns" and has the "lowest homicide rate in the entire world."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/30/viral-image/viral-flawed-post-compares-honduras-switzerland-gu/	There’s a reason they don’t call it Factbook. The latest example of a misleading factoid gone viral casts restrictive gun policy as a backfiring failure, with two countries as case studies. On one side of the post is Honduras, with a population of 8.2 million people and a government that "bans citizens from owning guns." Honduras has "the highest homicide rate in the entire world," the post claims. On the other side is similarly populated Switzerland, which "requires citizens to own guns" and has the "lowest homicide rate in the entire world." A reader wanted to know if the post’s counterintuitive message is right. The source of the claim was not immediately clear, though we found some examples of websites and figures repeating the message. Here’s why it’s flawed. Population We’ll pause on the numbers and start with an overriding issue with the post’s premise. It holds up population as the sole constant that justifies comparing these countries’ gun policy and violence. Even though Honduras and Switzerland are No. 94 and No. 96 in the CIA’s list of countries by population, this metric alone is not enough reason to compare the effect of different gun control laws in either country. There’s really no point in comparing the challenges of Honduras, a lower middle-income country in Central America beleaguered by corruption and violence from the drug trade and gangs, to Switzerland, an affluent country nestled in western Europe. "Of course, what you want to do is compare countries where everything else is the same, except for guns and gun laws, to see if guns and gun laws have any effect," said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health. "Switzerland and Honduras are not even close to being the same in many aspects of their society that will influence the levels of violence and homicide." The post ignores a litany of cultural, political and socioeconomic factors that play into gun violence, or a lack thereof. The gross domestic product per capita, to name one, is $2,435 in Honduras and $84,733 in Switzerland, according to the World Bank. "The determinants of homicide rates are multiple and not very well understood, and guns laws may indeed be one among many, many determinants," said Christopher Mikton, World Health Organization technical officer for violence prevention. "But to point them out as the sole cause is wrong." But even if you choose to ignore the macrofactors, the post messes up the particulars, too. Rates Honduras indisputably has the highest homicide rate in the world, with estimates ranging from a rate of 90.4 intentional homicides per 100,000 people in 2012, according to the United Nations, to 103.9 per 100,000 population, according to the World Health Organization. This was significantly higher than the rates of neighboring El Salvador (41.2), which has reduced its homicide rate following a truce among gangs, the UN said in its 2013 Global Study on Homicide. The vast majority, more than 80 percent, of those homicides are linked to a firearm. Lethal shootings most often occur in urban centers and areas along the Atlantic coast and border regions, which suggests the violence is linked to drug trafficking patterns and gangs, according to a report on Honduras by the Small Arms Survey, a Swiss-based research project. Switzerland’s homicide rate is among the lowest in the world, but the meme goes too far in saying it’s the very lowest. By the UN and WHO measures, the most recent Swiss intentional homicide rate is 0.6 deaths per population. Several countries — including Japan and Singapore, which have very strict gun laws, as well as Iceland and Luxembourg — posted lower rates than Switzerland in either one or both of the UN and WHO data sets. Laws The post is wrong about the gun laws in each country. Honduras doesn’t "ban" citizens from owning guns. The Small Arms Survey says the most popular gun in Honduras is the 9mm handgun, "which can be legally purchased and owned" — undermining the meme’s claim that Hondurans are banned from owning guns. Because this weapon is banned in nearby Mexico, the UN has said the difference in laws fosters the exchange of illegal weapons between the countries. An analysis of gun laws in six Latin American countries by Insight Crime, a foundation that studies crime and policy in Central America, characterizes Honduras’ regulations as "light" compared to the "restrictive" laws of Brazil and Mexico and "moderate" laws of Venezuela and Chile. Uruguay also has "light" gun control laws but an incredibly smaller homicide rate than Honduras of about 5.9 percent per 100,000 people. (It also has less organized crime.) The disparity in homicide rates and gun control laws showed "gun legislation, on its own, means little in terms of gun violence," the Insight Crime analysis found. The gun culture in Switzerland is altogether different. The country boasts the third-highest firearm ownership per capita rate, trailing the top-ranked United States and Yemen. Honduras is No. 88. A 2012 Time story about Switzerland’s gun culture notes how citizens hold their right to own guns as a patriotic duty, and Swiss children often join sharpshooting groups to hone their skills. But, again, Switzerland does not require "citizens to own guns." The government issues a gun to men for their mandatory military service, but the gun is taken home under "carefully controlled conditions without ammunition," said Mikton, the WHO officer who is also Swiss. "As soon as they have finished their military service — typically around 30 years of age — they have to return the gun," he said. Swiss gun laws are more strict than the post implies, though less tough than some other European Union countries. Swiss law requires mandatory background checks on civilian handgun purchases and licenses for the concealed carry of weapons, and it bans automatic weapons. Our ruling The viral post aims to jolt readers with a counterintuitive implication: Gun laws can lead to deadly unintended consequences. But the post is flawed on many levels. The comparison based on similar population size alone is shallow, and non-scientific. Moreover, Switzerland does not have the world’s lowest homicide level, and the post is flatly wrong about the laws in each country. This claim rates Pants on Fire!

pomt-12526	"Hate speech is not protected by the first amendment."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/21/howard-dean/howard-deans-wrong-tweet-constitution-doesnt-prote/	The Constitution doesn’t protect "hate speech," said former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, chiming into the debate over conservative pundit Ann Coulter’s upcoming event at the University of California, Berkeley. In February, Berkeley administrators had to cancel a speech by conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos after protesters set fires and threw objects at buildings. So after Berkeley College Republicans invited Coulter to speak on campus, administrators decided to postpone the event because they couldn’t make the necessary security preparations by the event date, April 27. As of April 21, Berkeley has invited Coulter to speak May 2 instead of the original date. But Coulter wants to stick to April 27, arguing that the postponement and other restrictions are arbitrary. Dean took to Twitter with his reaction to comments Coulter made in 2002 about the Oklahoma City bomber. She said, "My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building." "Hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment," Dean tweeted April 20. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This is incorrect. There is no universal definition of "hate speech," though Coulter has made a number of controversial comments about Mexicans, Muslims, Jews and immigrants generally that some might say fall under that umbrella. Regardless, the courts have decided that there are some forms of speech the Constitution doesn’t protect. But "hate speech" isn’t one. The First Amendment of the Constitution, included in the Bill of Rights, says: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances." This clause doesn’t apply to threats, child pornography and "fighting words" (speech that would likely draw someone into a fight, such as personal insults). There are numerous examples of the Supreme Court protecting speech that much of the public would find offensive or consider to be "hate speech." In 1969, the Supreme Court said an Ohio law prohibiting public speech that promotes illegal activity violated a Ku Klux Klan member’s First Amendment rights. In 1992, the court unanimously struck down a St. Paul, Minn., law that banned displaying a symbol that "arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender," like a burning cross. More recently, the family of a deceased soldier sued members of the Westboro Baptist Church who had protested the soldier’s funeral with signs displaying anti-gay slogans. But in 2011, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment right to free speech meant that the church members were not liable. Sometimes hate speech is also a threat or "fighting words." In those cases, hate speech would be excluded from protections offered by the First Amendment, said James Weinstein, an expert in free speech at Arizona State University’s Sandra Day O’Connor Law School, in a past PolitiFact interview. For example, it would be unconstitutional to ban someone from putting a racial epithet on a sign at a protest. But if someone used the same racial epithet while credibly saying they plan to harm someone of that race, that might count as a threat and therefore lose its First Amendment protection. But the speech loses the protection because it’s a threat, not because it’s hate speech. "With that caveat, the overwhelming understanding is that ‘hate speech’ is constitutionally protected in the United States," Michael Herz, a professor at Cardozo Law, previously told PolitiFact. We reached out to Dean’s staff for comment and didn’t hear back. But he did link to a tweet from former New York Times reporter Steven Greenhouse that referenced Coulter’s statement that she regrets that the Oklahoma City bomber didn’t hit the New York Times building. Even though Coulter’s comment mentions a violent act, it isn’t clearly "intended to promote imminent illegal conduct," which is the standard necessary for the speech to no longer have constitutional protection, wrote Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment expert and law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, in a blog reacting to Dean’s tweet. Regardless, Dean appears to be saying that the Coulter quote is hate speech — as opposed to a threat or "fighting words" — and that isn’t enough to strip it of its First Amendment protections. Separate from the "hate speech" question, we wondered if Berkeley’s treatment of Coulter violates her First Amendment right to free speech. Coulter has the constitutional right to be treated in the same way as other campus speakers without regard to her viewpoint, Volokh said in an interview with PolitiFact. Berkeley has a policy by which student groups can invite speakers of their choosing, and as a public university, it cannot administer this policy in a way that treats student groups differently based on political leanings, he said. University administrators have said their concern is not Coulter’s politics; instead they’re worried about the potential for violent protest. But this also might not pass muster as a reason for Berkeley to treat Coulter different than other campus speakers. The Supreme Court has established a general principle that a government administrator can’t decide to charge a group a higher fee for event security based on anticipated public reaction to the content of the event, and a lower court found that this applies to colleges, too. So if Berkeley is basing its security decisions on what it expects Coulter to say, that could pose a problem. Our ruling Dean said, "Hate speech is not protected by the First Amendment." There are some exceptions to the free speech clause in the First Amendment, but "hate speech" is not one of them. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held up the right of an individual or group to engage in speech that much of the public likely finds offensive, like displaying swastikas, burning crosses or protesting a soldier’s funeral.

pomt-07908	Georgia is the second-fastest growing state for international tourists.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/02/chris-cummiskey/georgia-second-fastest-growing-state-tourism-offic/	Who needs the Statue of Liberty to draw tourists when you have the Big Chicken? Georgia’s new economic development commissioner, Chris Cummiskey, surprised us when he made this claim during a recent state budget hearing: "We are the second-fastest-growing state for international tourists." Virginia, the commissioner said, is first. So Georgia had a greater increase in international tourists than New York, home to Broadway, Lady Liberty and the amazing Manhattan skyline? The Peach State’s tourism market is growing faster than the market in California, the land of Hollywood and Disneyland? Georgia is ahead of Florida, where you can sunbathe in February on South Beach? Really? AJC PolitiFact Georgia went searching for answers. Georgia Economic Development Department spokeswoman Alison Tyrer directed us to a 2009 study by the federal government about international tourism broken down by each state. In 2008, an estimated 634,000 international tourists came to Georgia, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration. About 689,000 international tourists visited the Peach State the following year, the federal agency reported. That’s nearly a 9 percent increase. A survey examining international tourism in 2010 has not been done yet, the ITA said. The top markets for international tourists who visited Georgia were the United Kingdom, Germany, the Caribbean, the Netherlands, France and Brazil, according to an ITA spokeswoman. In Atlanta, the tourists like to go to attractions such as the Georgia Aquarium. They also enjoy the Georgia coastline and are curious about the state’s antebellum architecture. Virginia had a 16 percent increase, according to the study. New York, Florida, California, Nevada and Hawaii ranked first through fifth in the number of international tourists, but only two of those five states (Florida and Hawaii) actually had more international tourists in 2009 than 2008, the ITA found. Hawaii had a 2 percent increase, while the number of international tourists who visited Florida increased by 1 percent. The ITA report found Atlanta had the greatest percentage increase of international tourists of the nation’s top 20 markets. Georgia is well-known as a state that hosts many conventions. But we also know Georgia has Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world’s busiest airport. So we wondered, perhaps, if these tourists were visiting the area overnight and whether the ITA’s numbers were deceptive. An ITA spokeswoman said the agency did not have specific data for how long people stayed in Georgia. An Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau spokeswoman said the average tourist stays in Atlanta about two or three days. So what’s bringing these international tourists to Georgia? Cory Churches, the ITA spokeswoman, believes part of the explanation may be the merger of Delta Air Lines with Northwest Airlines in 2008. "Delta Air Lines has been enhancing its ATL [Atlanta] hub presence, including international routes, since the merger with Northwest," Churches said. Delta has been eager to have more international flights, said Lauren Jarrell, the communications director for the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported Delta’s desire to have 50 percent of its business be the more lucrative international flights. Jarrell said more conventioneers are coming from outside the country. For example, Jarrell said 56 percent of the attendees to one convention were international. Tyrer, the state economic development spokeswoman, said Delta’s push for more international flights has helped. She also said the department has been more aggressive in marketing Georgia in other countries, particularly China and Germany, as a tourist destination. Georgia has had a tourism representative in the U.K. for about 10 years, Tyrer said. The numbers in the federal report accurately reflect what the commissioner told state lawmakers in the budget hearing. We rate Cummiskey’s statement as True.

That’s not true. "Mexico’s next president calls for an invasion of the U.S.," said a headline by WeSupportDonaldTrump.com. The website, which lacks original reporting, has a hodgepodge of articles about politics with a pro-President Donald Trump slant. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. "Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, also known as ‘AMLO,’ has been openly telling his people to flood the U.S. border. What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise… Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention," the story reads. The story used a quote of López Obrador for which they cited the Daily Caller to back up their point: " ‘And soon, very soon — after the victory of our movement — we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,’ López Obrador said, adding that immigrants ‘must leave their towns and find a life in the United States.’ He then declared it as ‘a human right we will defend.’ " We found the original quote in the Mexican newspaper, El Universal. It has been taken out of context. "Y ya pronto, muy pronto, al triunfo de nuestro movimiento vamos a defender a los migrantes de todo el continente Americano y todos los migrantes del mundo que, por necesidad, tienen que abandonar sus pueblos para buscar la vida en Estados Unidos, es un derecho humano que vamos a defender," El Universal quotes López Obrador saying in a speech on June 19. That translates to: "Soon, very soon, after the victory of our movement, we will defend migrants all over the American continent and the migrants of the world who, by necessity, must abandon their towns to find life in the United States; it’s a human right we will defend." López Obrador is not telling anyone to flood the border, but saying that he will defend those who find themselves with no other option but to relocate to the United States. The quote was delivered in the wake of news of the Trump administration’s rampant separation of families at the border. Over 2,300 children were separated from their parents between May 5 and June 9, according to the Homeland Security Department. We found no indications that López Obrador was encouraging people to abandon their towns in favor of the United States. Instead, he urged current Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to complete the following three actions: Send a diplomatic note in protest of the Trump’s administration’s policies to the United States; Solicit the urgent intervention of the United Nations commissioner for human rights; and, Send a team of lawyers, psychologists and social workers to aid kids and their parents at the border.

pomt-04744	When his grandfather arrived in the United States, "there were no government benefits for immigrants."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-when-his-grandfather-arrived-us/	During a speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa, former presidential candidate Rick Santorum evoked the America his father found when he arrived on these shores as an immigrant in the 1920s. "In 1923, there were no government benefits for immigrants, except one: Freedom!" Santorum said. This is close to a claim by Santorum that made in a Feb. 29, 2012, speech near Knoxville, Tenn., he said that during that era "there were no government benefits," which earned a False on the Truth-O-Meter. So we will re-evaluate it here, though we won’t consider the issue of "freedom," which we believe is too vague to be fact-checked. When we first looked at this question, we found there were two major sources of payments to individuals prior to 1925 -- veterans benefits and workers' compensation. Veterans benefits. The federal government began funding benefits for Civil War veterans in 1862, initially for those who had been injured and then, progressively, to wider and wider groups of those who had served. In 1904 President Theodore Roosevelt signed an order defining "disability" to include old age, as long as the beneficiary had at least 90 days of service and an honorable discharge. University of Arizona economist Price V. Fishback wrote that "roughly 40 to 48 percent of the elderly in the North and Midwest in the early 1900s were receiving pensions" through the system. Peter Blanck and Chen Song wrote in a 2003 paper in the William and Mary Law Review that "at its height in the 1890s, the (Union veteran) pension scheme consumed almost half of the federal budget and was intimately linked to the Republican Party's strategy to maintain the soldier vote and hold the White House." Worker compensation. A federal worker-compensation law to help civilian government workers injured or made sick on the job was adopted in 1908, according to a history on the Social Security Administration website. Starting in 1911, states began passing such laws, and by 1929, laws were in effect in all but four states. While these are the clearest examples that run counter to Santorum’s claim, there are a few other efforts worth noting. Local government aid to the poor. During the period Santorum is talking about, local governments were responsible for providing benefits to the poor, Fishback told PolitiFact. These payments tended to be modest. Fishback cited a study by Brendan Livingston of Rowan University that looked at welfare policies in Massachusetts -- generally considered the most generous state in the first decades of the 20th century -- and found that local governments were spending an amount equivalent to about 0.5 percent to 1 percent of all income earned by state residents on relief for the poor. Private charities were spending at about twice that rate. By 1925, most states also had "mothers' pensions" on the books, which allowed widows to raise their children without having to put them in orphanages, according to Fishback’s paper. By then, a handful of states also had means-tested pensions for the elderly, and a sizable number had pensions for the blind. And states or municipalities often operated mental hospitals, old-age homes, orphanages and general hospitals, all for the public benefit. Schools and universities. While education isn’t a direct payment to individuals, it’s worth pointing out that they represented a government-provided benefit in kind. "Primary and secondary education were already overwhelmingly paid for by taxes from the late 1800s on," said Peter Lindert, an economist at the University of California at Davis. Meanwhile, higher education had land-grant subsidies -- federally backed institutions dating back to the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890. "Because they were public institutions, tuition was cheaper on account of public subsidies," said Gary Gerstle, a historian and political scientist at Vanderbilt University. "This was clearly a government benefit." Health funding for mothers and newborns. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding signed the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act, which gave states matching federal funds to build and operate prenatal and child health care centers. All told, by 1922, various expenditures for public benefits amounted to 6.8 percent of expenditures by the three levels of government combined. Santorum does have a point that social welfare spending by 1925 was relatively small compared to what it would ultimately become, because two major programs, Social Security and Medicare, didn't start until later. It’s worth noting that the specific individual Santorum cited -- his newly arrived immigrant grandfather -- wouldn’t have directly benefited from military pensions or a land-grant college upon his arrival on these shores, though other immigrants, such as those who arrived in time to serve in previous wars, could have. Experts contacted for this story said they were not aware that the benefits provided were restricted only to the native-born. In the meantime, his ability to collect worker compensation would have depended on what state he lived in upon his arrival. Similarly, the local aid to the poor he would have qualified for would have varied significantly depending on what city or county he lived in, and it would have been small by the standards of later decades. Still, it was not zero, as Santorum said. Our ruling Contrary to Santorum’s claim, millions of Americans in the 1920s would have either qualified for benefits directly, such as payments to veterans, or have been protected by workers' compensation laws that provided benefits to those who became disabled by their jobs. And state and local governments had the longstanding role of paying support to people who were disabled or indigent. This provides a much more complex picture than Santorum is painting.

pomt-02089	Says Mark Begich "has taken campaign cash from the Kochs" while Dan Sullivan hasn’t.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/19/dan-sullivan/gop-opponent-says-mark-begich-took-campaign-money-/	In Alaska, no U.S. Senate candidate wants to be tied to the billionaire Koch brothers. Back-and-forth ads between incumbent Mark Begich, a Democrat, and former Attorney General Dan Sullivan, a Republican frontrunner, have both slung accusations of Koch affiliation. A pro-Begich super PAC, Put Alaska First, fired the first shot in April. It released the ad "Lost," which criticized Sullivan for not doing enough to prevent the Koch-owned refinery from closing, resulting in a loss of 80 jobs. "Dan Sullivan remains silent about the jobs being lost here," the ad said. "And those same billionaires, the Koch brothers, are supporting his campaign." The next week Sullivan released a radio ad: "Dan Sullivan has never taken a dime from the Koch brothers," the narrator said. "It’s Begich who has taken campaign cash from the Kochs." As a Democrat, Begich wouldn’t be a typical recipient of Koch funds. So we decided to fact-check whether the attack was accurate. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org pointed out that although Sullivan hasn’t accepted money directly from the Koch brothers or their affiliates, the Koch-backed Americans For Prosperity has spent nearly $1 million on Begich attack ads. Sullivan isn't receiving those funds, but he does benefit from an attack on his opponent that can't be legally coordinated directly between the candidate and the group. As for Begich, we found that KochPAC, a Koch Industries group, gave $5,000 to Begich’s Great Land PAC back in 2010. Begich’s PAC primarily gives money to candidates, as well as state and federal Democratic parties. In 2010, the Kochs also gave money to Democratic senators like Mary Landrieu, Mark Pryor and Chuck Schumer. In 2013 and 2014, they haven’t given any money to Democratic Senate candidates, and just three Democratic House candidates. A spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which runs OpenSecrets.org, said she’d be surprised to see much Koch money going to Democrats this cycle. A Koch Industries spokesman told Politico in March 2014 that KochPAC doesn’t base its donations on the candidate’s party, but rather on the company’s business and policy interests. Our ruling Sullivan said Mark Begich "has taken campaign cash from the Kochs" but that Sullivan "hasn’t taken a dime." In 2010, KochPAC donated $5,000 to a Begich-affiliated PAC. But that's a modest amount by campaign-finance standards, and Begich hasn’t received any more in the past four years. While Sullivan hasn’t received money directly from the Kochs, he and Begich’s other Republican challengers certainly benefit from the much larger TV ad buys by Koch-affiliated groups attacking the Democrat. A Koch-funded group, Americans For Prosperity, has spent nearly $1 million in Alaska benefiting Sullivan and other Republicans in the race. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10002	The Republican leadership's budget proposal "doesn't contain any numbers."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/27/robert-gibbs/republican-budget-proposal-lacks-numbers-revenues-/	The back and forth over President Barack Obama's budget has gone like this: Republicans say it's big and costly and will saddle future generations with too much debt. Obama complains the Republicans are the party of "no" and don't have their own plan. Republicans finally release their own plan. "The Republican Road to Recovery" is a 19-page document released March 26 that includes sections on curbing spending, creating jobs, lowering taxes and controlling debt. But it came under quick criticism from White House officials who said it was remarkably short on specifics — so much, in fact, that it doesn’t contain actual numbers about how much the Republicans would spend on various areas of the government. "It's interesting to have a budget that doesn't contain any numbers. I think the party of 'no' has become the party of 'no new ideas,' " said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs. "I think the administration is glad that the Republicans heard the president's call to submit an alternative. We just hope that next time it will contain actual numbers so somebody can evaluate what it means," he added. A reporter asked him if wasn't being a little snarky there. "I think if I intoned to you that I would produce a 20-page document that outlined my budget priorities, that it might actually contain a chart with some numbers. I don't think that's a whole lot to ask," Gibbs answered. We were curious if Gibbs was right that the Republican budget outline contained no numbers, or if he was just being snarky. So we downloaded the Republican document and read it. We found Gibbs is right. It's a budget proposal without proposing actual numbers. It's not very long, and you might even want to read it for yourself . But if you don't want to, here's our quick summary: • Spending: The Republican plan says the Obama budget spends too much and is "reckless." The Republicans say they would undo wasteful spending from recent legislation such as the economic stimulus bill and the omnibus spending bill for this year. But they don't specify what programs or how much. The Republican plan also says it would "cut overall nondefense spending by reforming or eliminating a host of wasteful programs deemed ineffective by various government entities." So what programs and how much? The plan doesn't say. • Lowering taxes and creating jobs: In a rare moment of specificity, the Republican plan says it would rewrite the tax code so that people making up to $100,000 would be taxed at a marginal rate of 10 percent and everyone above that would be taxed 25 percent. Fair enough. So how much would that cost? The plan doesn't say. It offers a few other tax-cutting ideas — tax deductions for businesses and an overall vow to keep the Bush tax cuts — but again there are no estimates about the impact on revenues. • Controlling debt: The Republican plan says it will control debt by ending spending on bailouts for Wall Street. For a savings of ... hmm, doesn't say. The plan also opposes runaway inflation and promotes keeping the cost of living low for families and entrepreneurs. Sounds great! What that means for the federal budget, we couldn't tell you. Now, we should note that the Republican document has some numbers in it. But they're numbers about Obama's budget, used to illustrate the party's complaints, under labels like "Future Debt Burden" and "Expanding the Size of Government." What the Republican plan lacks is the numbers that really matter, numbers that would show how much the Republicans propose to spend on various parts of government. There are many pressing questions in the public debate that an alternative budget could answer. For example, if we're going want to cut wasteful spending, what programs should be cut? Also, what will cutting taxes do to deficit projections in years to come? But the Republican plan doesn't provide any answers. The Republican House leaders said they will be releasing more data next week. Perhaps that will include some numbers. But Gibbs was right. The first version of the "Republican Road to Recovery" is a budget without budget numbers. We find Gibbs' statement to be True.

pomt-01194	"We’re borrowing 20% of (the federal) budget."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/03/glenn-grothman/glenn-grothman-says-20-percent-federal-budget-borr/	Wisconsin Republican Congressman-elect Glenn Grothman foresees another showdown with President Barack Obama over federal spending. "I assume he’s going to want to spend a lot more on a lot of programs than we are," the Republican from Campbellsport said Nov. 30, 2014, on "UpFront with Mike Gousha." Grothman, elected to succeed retiring Republican Tom Petri, threw out a statistic to make his point: "Just the fact that right now we’re borrowing 20% of our budget does show there are going to be some big differences between the president and us on government spending." Last time we fact checked a similar budget-borrowing claim was mid-2011. Then, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin made two points in an interview regarding an increase in the federal government’s debt limit. One of them was that America borrows 42 cents of every dollar Washington spends. In other words, 42 percent. That was accurate, we found, based on actual budget figures from fiscal year 2010 and estimates for 2012. (Some problems with the other part of his claim dragged the overall rating down to Half True). That time period, marked by the Great Recession, coincided with the deepest borrowing for federal purposes since World War II. Let’s bring this up to date. Grothman was using accurate figures from a reliable source. He made the same claim repeatedly during his congressional campaign earlier this year. But the numbers were slightly out of date by the time he spoke on Gousha’s show. In fiscal year 2013, the U.S. government’s outlays outstripped revenues by $680 billion, forcing borrowing that amounted to 20 percent of spending. The fiscal year ended in September 2013. That’s what Grothman cited. But we now have federal spending and revenue data through the end of the 2014 federal fiscal year that ended in September 2014. They show the deficit was still large, but fell significantly, to $483 billion, according to a summary of U.S. Treasury figures analyzed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In the latest accounting, the borrowing figure amounts to 13.8 percent, the lowest since just before the recession. Deficits have been falling markedly in recent years. As we reported in rating True an Obama claim at LaborFest in Milwaukee in September 2014, deficits have dropped by more than half during his presidency as the economic recovery has boosted tax revenues and spending on emergency assistance has dropped. The Treasury and White House announced the results on Oct. 15, 2014, six weeks before Grothman’s appearance on "UpFront." The subsequent CBO report came out Nov. 10, 2014, about three weeks before Grothman made the claim. Looking ahead to the 2015 budget, the borrowing proportion is predicted to drop again, noted Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He cited CBO projections. A final note on the bottom line. The declining share of borrowing doesn’t mean overall spending is dropping. In 2014, spending actually went up 1.4 percent, but revenues increased 9 percent as a result of stronger flows of individual and corporate income tax receipts, as well as payroll tax deductions for social insurance programs. In 2014, Social Security rose by $37 billion (or 5 percent); Medicare increased $14 billion (or 3 percent); and Medicaid rose $36 billion (or 14 percent), largely because of the expansion of insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, the Congressional Budget Office reported. On the other hand, spending for unemployment benefits declined by $24 billion (or 33 percent) as fewer people received benefits after an emergency extension expired, CBO said. Our rating Grothman claimed that "We’re borrowing 20% of our budget." He was on target earlier this year with that figure based on 2013 results, but the latest numbers are just in for 2014 and show a decline from that 20 percent mark. On balance we rate his claim Half True.	None	Glenn Grothman	None	None	None	2014-12-03T05:00:00	2014-11-30	['None']
pomt-14785	"You go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/dec/04/barack-obama/do-fish-swim-streets-miami-high-tide-barack-obama-/	As the world watched President Barack Obama’s news conference about climate change, he drew on South Florida to illustrate a point about the impact -- and he zeroed in on fish. "As the science around climate change is more accepted, as people start realizing that even today you can put a price on the damage that climate change is doing -- you go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets, you know, that -- there's a cost to that," Obama said at the climate change conference in Paris Dec. 1. That opened the floodgates to a question about whether there are truly fish in the streets. At a town hall event in Iowa, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was among the skeptics: "Obama said today the streets of Miami are flooded and fish are falling on them. I live there. I don’t know what he’s talking about.’’ So is it a tall tale that fish swim in the streets of Miami? It’s certainly not a regular occurrence. But some people, including a few public officials, say they have seen it. And most importantly, it has been caught on video. The source of Obama’s fish story Spokespersons for the White House sent us news articles from 2014 and 2015 about flooding from king tides in South Florida. (King tides, for those who aren’t familiar with the term, are the highest predicted high tides and happen once or twice a year on the Florida coast. They occur when the orbits and alignment of the Earth, moon, and sun combine to produce the greatest tidal effects of the year.) "There were fish swimming in the street," John Morgan, a Delray Beach city official, told the Sun-Sentinel in October 2014 after a few inches of sea water accumulated without any rain. Morgan told PolitiFact that he has seen fish on Marine Way, a road in a low-lying area, as well as at Veterans Park. "I have been with the city a couple years now, and I’ve probably seen the fish in the streets at least a half dozen times," said Morgan, who now heads up his city’s environmental department. A Hollywood resident, Robin Rorapaugh, told the Miami Herald’s Public Insight Network in October 2015 that king tides had grown in her neighborhood and that "anyone who doubts climate change should witness the sea come through the storm drains — fish were swimming in the street." We also found video evidence that supported Obama’s point. A Sept. 28 TV news report featured video showing a fish swimming on Cordova Road in Fort Lauderdale. "Look at that," a bystander said. "A mullet in the street." Nancy Gassman, assistant public works director in Fort Lauderdale, told PolitiFact Florida that fish on the streets are a "regular occurrence" during high tide flooding in Las Olas Isles and Las Olas Boulevard. "In past tidal flooding, I personally have seen fish in the streets," she said. Obama’s comments echoed a recent statement by former Vice President Al Gore, who told NPR in November: "I was in Miami last month and fish from the ocean were swimming on some of the streets on a sunny day because it was a high tide. In Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, many other places – that happens regularly." Our efforts to reach Gore were unsuccessful. However, Miami Beach officials told PolitiFact that Gore’s comment stems from a tour during a conference about climate change that happened to coincide with the king tides. Miami Beach officials, including assistant city manager/public works director Eric Carpenter, showed Gore the impact of the tides on the state-owned Indian Creek Drive where the water washes over the sea wall onto the street. "I absolutely saw the fish," Carpenter told PolitiFact. "You can actually see the fish swimming out of the creek, past the mangrove trees that are there and into the street. I probably saw close to a dozen. They weren’t big fish, but I don’t know, two or three inches long?" While working on temporary fixes to the road to try to alleviate flooding, Carpenter said he saw the fish on several occasions. "It was not an isolated incident," he said. Flooding has become an expensive problem for places such as Miami Beach, which flood for several days twice a year as a result of king tides. The coastal city is on track to spend around $500 million to install 80 pumps and raise roads and seawalls across the city. The Herald reported that while the city has flooded for decades during king tides, it has been getting worse. "The king tides have gotten higher in recent years," said Colin Polsky, director of the center for environmental studies at Florida Atlantic University, told the Herald. "And the king tides we're seeing more recently have been higher than they were predicted to be." It’s important to point out that sightings of fish in the street are not common. Hollywood City Commissioner Patty Asseff, who lives across the street from the intracoastal, said she had never heard of fish in the streets. "It was the first I had heard about fish in the streets," she told PolitiFact after reading Obama’s comments about Miami. "We have water, we have flooding, but fish I haven’t seen yet." In the past year, the city of Hollywood has spent more than $1 million on flood gates and pumps in parts of the city to alleviate flooding. For the record, Obama’s statement was technically about Miami -- not Miami Beach. Miami public works director Eduardo Santamaria said he wasn’t aware of fish on the streets in Miami, but he said the city is higher than Miami Beach and parts of Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood. Our ruling Obama said, "You go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets." This reminds us of the fishing stories you might hear from your uncle. Fish have been seen (and videotaped) on the streets. But that’s been in the low-lying areas that surround Miami, not on the streets in the city proper. And the sightings were during the more dramatic king tides, when high tides are at their highest, not during average daily high tides. Overall, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-04040	"State revenue projections have missed the mark month after month."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/30/steve-henson/democrat-leader-says-gop-policies-not-doing-enough/	The top Democrat in the Georgia Senate recently made his case that his party has the better plan to revitalize the state’s economy. The proposal by Senate Minority Leader Steve Henson included an interesting claim about Georgia’s finances that we wanted to fact-check. "State revenue projections have missed the mark month after month," Henson, a veteran lawmaker from DeKalb County, said in a news release. Liz Flowers, who wrote the news release, explained to us what Henson meant. State budget officials projected revenue collected by Georgia’s government would increase by almost 5 percent during the 12-month fiscal year that will end June 30, said Flowers, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Senate Democratic Caucus. Henson’s point is there have been several months in which the state fell below the 5 percent mark. While Georgia lawmakers did not make monthly revenue estimates, Henson believes it is fair to examine revenue on a monthly basis by the 5 percent benchmark, noting that the state’s finances are tracked on a monthly basis. "It wouldn’t make sense to check our state budget only annually," Henson said. Georgia lawmakers passed a budget this year that they expected to collect about $19.2 billion in total revenue for this fiscal year. The overwhelming bulk of state revenue comes from property, sales and income taxes. About $1 billion of that money comes from lottery sales and other sources, which are directed to specific state programs. The $18.2 billion in projected general revenue is a 4.9 percent increase from the prior fiscal year, which began July 1, 2011, and ended June 30, 2012. Georgia’s estimated increase for the current fiscal year was higher than most states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Economists say Georgia’s economy is growing, which they attribute to an increase in information technology, business services, manufacturing and transportation jobs. Each month, Gov. Nathan Deal’s office releases a breakdown of total taxes and revenue the state collected the prior month. Here’s the breakdown: July 2012: up 7.4 percent. August 2012: up 1.9 percent. September 2012: up 3.9 percent. October 2012: up 6.4 percent. November 2012: down 0.7 percent. December 2012: up 9.8 percent. Georgia’s revenue increased less than 5 percent in three of those six months, according to those estimates. The monthly breakdowns do not explain why state revenue was lower during some months. Through those six months, state officials estimate they have collected about $8.5 billion in total taxes and other revenue, a 4.9 percent increase over the same period in the prior fiscal year. The state’s fiscal economist, Ken Heaghney, told a joint committee of Georgia lawmakers on Jan. 22 that tax collections are projected to increase by 3.9 percent for the rest of this fiscal year. Henson said the state’s latest estimate of a 3.9 percent increase for the remainder of the fiscal year also validates his argument. "In 2012, Georgia's revenue projections remained low for nearly half the year. A spike to 9 percent in December made up ground in the governor's revenue projections," Henson said. To sum up, the senator claimed "state revenue projections have missed the mark month after month." Revenue increased less than 5 percent in three of the six months so far this fiscal year. The state, though, doesn’t do monthly revenue projections, and Georgia is on pace to increase its revenue by almost 5 percent from the prior fiscal year. Technically, there’s accuracy in Henson’s statement, but there’s also some important context missing. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-13181	"We have never done business with Donald Trump."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/oct/26/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-says-his-family-never-did-business-/	U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy has lambasted U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio for continuing to endorse Donald Trump for president. Rubio has fired back by portraying Murphy, a Democrat, as having business ties to Trump. "There's only one person on the stage tonight whose family made millions of dollars in partnership with Donald Trump and that's you," Rubio said in the first Senate debate on Oct. 17. After the debate, in a TV interview with WFLA that aired Oct. 23, Murphy said that Rubio wasn’t telling the truth. "It's an absolute lie. We’ve never done business with Donald Trump," Murphy said. "And Marco Rubio is just trying to distract and confuse the voters because he’s so concerned with his own choice for president." Reporter Candace McCowan followed up: "Was there not some dealings between him and your father on a real estate deal?" "No, absolutely not. We’ve never had a contract with Donald Trump," Murphy said. Who’s telling the truth here? We found that Coastal Construction, a luxury residential building firm owned by Murphy’s father, Thomas P. Murphy Jr., did have business dealings related to Trump. But they were not direct contractual agreements, and they require further explanation. Condo construction projects During the debate, Rubio was referring to two condo projects that Coastal Construction built: Trump Hollywood and Trump Royale in Sunny Isles Beach. According to Coastal Construction’s website, it built Trump Royale, a 55-story, 386-residence project owned by Dezer Properties. Coastal won the contract for the project in 2005. Coastal won the contract to build Trump Hollywood in 2007, a 42-story, 208-unit condo project owned by The Related Group. (Although Patrick worked at Coastal Construction in the past, for much of the time that the condos were under construction, Patrick worked at Deloitte. Patrick Murphy owns between $1 million and $5 million in assets from Coastal Construction, according to congressional financial disclosure forms.) We interviewed Thomas P. Murphy Jr. as well as the owners of both projects, to find out the connection between Coastal Construction and Trump. There is no dispute that Coastal Construction was the builder, and Trump’s organization had the licensing deal. But it was the owners -- The Related Group and Dezer Development -- who hired Coastal. The Related Group and Dezer reached an agreement with Trump separately. "I hired Coastal to build the building, and I signed up with the Trump Organization for the licensing deal," said Gil Dezer, president of Dezer Development. "The licensing deal was just that. It gave them no rights to construction decisions." (An article in The Real Deal, a real estate publication, in 2008 described a more intensive business relationship between Dezer and Trump and referred to Trump as Dezer’s "development partner.") We received a similar statement about Trump from The Related Group. "Mr. Trump’s role was that of licensor; he was not a partner in the development, and he had no role in the actual development process or the hiring of Coastal Construction," said Betsy McCoy, The Related Group’s general counsel and vice president. Although Murphy wasn’t the one who entered into the agreement with Trump, he knew about Trump’s role, which had been publicized in news reports. The projects were clearly branded with the Trump name. "We are extremely excited to be a part of this project and for the opportunity to continue working with such a reputable and powerful development team," Murphy told the South Florida Business Journal in 2007 about the Hollywood project. "The tower's sleek and innovative design is sure to make its mark on the Hollywood skyline, and we look forward to delivering it on time." Both Murphys have downplayed the link to Trump during the campaign, particularly after the first debate. "Coastal has never worked with Donald Trump personally or with any of his businesses," Thomas P. Murphy told PolitiFact Florida. After the debate, Patrick Murphy distanced his father’s firm from Trump. "It’s an absolute lie," Murphy told NBC8 in Tampa. "We’ve never done business with Donald Trump. "We have never done business with Donald Trump," he told CBS in Tampa. Murphy told a reporter for the Tampa Bay Times, the owner of PolitiFact, that Coastal Construction had nothing to do with the Trump licensing agreement. "What that developer names that building, what they call it, has nothing to do with us,"’ he said. "We’ve never had a single contract with Donald Trump." But clearly Coastal Construction at the time was aware of Trump’s role and didn’t appear to have a problem with it. CNN reported Oct. 25 that in a photo obtained from Getty, Thomas P. Murphy can be seen with Trump and a group of people wearing Trump-branded hard hats at the groundbreaking ceremony for Trump Hollywood in 2007. (Thomas P. Murphy is on the far left.) Murphy’s campaign spokesman Joshua Karp said that Trump’s involvement was irrelevant to Coastal’s role building the units. "Trump's name may have helped market the condo units after Coastal's role was completed, but Coastal has never benefited from Trump at all," he said. "The developers paid Coastal for services, which was construction, and developers paid Donald Trump for the privilege of using his name and image in promotional materials. Point of fact, there was no money connection between Trump and Coastal Construction." So would we call the projects a "partnership" between Coastal Construction and Trump as Rubio said? We posed that question to Jack McCabe, a South Florida real estate expert hired as an expert witness on behalf of condo buyers in two separate Trump condo cases in Tampa and Fort Lauderdale. McCabe said that when condo buyers signed contracts, it included a paragraph that stated Trump was not a partner. "Even though buyers had every inclination Trump was an actual partner in the deals, the paperwork said otherwise," he said. But it also appears that Coastal Construction boasted of doing work for Trump once. Coastal Construction president Dan Whiteman in 2008 told South Florida Constructor, a trade publication, "Many of (Coastal’s) high-rise residential projects have been built for world-renowned developers including Jorge Perez, Craig Robins and Donald Trump." That quote was included in opposition research that Murphy’s 2014 congressional campaign commissioned. On Oct. 14, BuzzFeed reported about the opposition research. Rubio said that Murphy’s family made "millions" off the condo projects. We don’t know the amount Coastal Construction earned, since it is a private firm. However, McCabe told us that the industry standard is between 8 and 12 percent. In news articles and interviews we found price tags for the projects between $150 million and $350 million, so it’s likely that Coastal Construction did make millions. Thomas Murphy said that Coastal made the fair-market rate for building these projects. Our ruling Murphy said in an interview, "We have never done business with Donald Trump." Murphy’s family’s construction firm, Coastal Construction, built Trump condo projects in Hollywood and Sunny Isles Beach. The owners of the projects -- not Trump -- hired Coastal as the builder, and then separately the owners reached licensing agreements with Trump. So while Coastal built projects that carried Trump’s name, even boasting about it at least once, they didn’t directly strike a partnership together. But they did work on the same condo projects.

pomt-09082	"Fifty-three percent of teens in Central Falls are getting pregnant."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jun/25/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-53-percent-teenagers-central-falls-are/	During a May 4 forum that included six gubernatorial candidates, independent Lincoln Chafee was asked by Vanessa Volz, of R.I. National Organization for Women, about the high rate of teen sexual activity, the social and economic costs of teen pregnancy, and whether he would support a bill requiring age-appropriate and medically accurate sex education in Rhode Island's public schools. He said he would. "I travel around the state visiting senior centers and I was visiting a Central Falls senior center and the Central Falls social agency was in the same building and office. And the social agent that was there said, 'You wouldn't believe the teen pregnancy in Central Falls. It's 53 percent.' Fifty-three percent of teens in Central Falls are getting pregnant," Chafee said. Later in his response, he made it clear he wasn't including males in that statistic: "We talk about the high dropout rate in Central Falls. Well it's obvious. Fifty-three percent of the young women are getting pregnant and have to take care of a child at home." But still. Fifty-three percent? So we contacted Chafee's campaign manager, J.R. Pagliarini, who conceded that the statistic, which Chafee has used on more than one occasion, is inaccurate. "The senator visited Central Falls late last year and was told by a social worker working for the city that the teen pregnancy rate was over 50 percent. That individual misread page 4 of the attached November 2 press release from Kids Count that stated that 'the teen birth rate among girls ages 15-17 in Central Falls was 59.2 births per 1,000 teen girls, about three times the state rate of 19.1 per 1,000 teen girls ages 15-17.' " Those numbers translate to 5.92 percent for Central Falls girls 15 to 17 and 1.91 percent statewide. That's about one ninth the rate cited by Chafee during the candidate forum and other appearances. Since then, the Central Falls numbers have gotten worse. The 2010 Rhode Island Kids Count Factbook reported that the teen birth rate for Central Falls had risen to 6.13 percent while the Rhode Island average had declined to 1.89 percent. When you include 18- and 19-year-olds into the mix, the birth rate is 3.07 percent statewide and 9.55 in Central Falls. And that doesn't include women who were pregnant but never delivered because of abortion or miscarriage. Clearly, Central Falls has a disturbingly high teenage pregnancy rate, but it’s not nearly as high as Chafee has portrayed it. When it comes to getting his numbers right, Chafee fails the pregnancy test. We rate his claim as False.	None	Lincoln Chafee	None	None	None	2010-06-25T12:02:00	2010-05-04	['None']

But this is made up. "Malia Obama suspended after racist anti-white attack goes viral," states an April 9 headline on Only Politics, a website with headlines supportive of President Donald Trump. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story appeared to be copied from a website by Christopher Blair, a frequent purveyor of fake news. His Facebook page warns: "Nothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. You have been warned." The article said that Malia Obama was suspended after writing a paper imagining a "world without white people." The story said that Obama wrote: "White people are so 1960’s. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30." Predictions by the U.S. Census show that the white race will increase from 248 million in 2016 to 263 million in 2030. The story quoted a person said to be Harvard Dean Cain Markholder: "This sort of attack against any race is uncalled for. Ms. Obama has been informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement." Harvard has multiple deans, but none is named Cain Markholder. Harvard media relations did not respond to our query. We found no news reports that Malia Obama had been suspended from Harvard. Malia and Sasha Obama, the daughters of former President Barack Obama, have been the subject of multiple fake news stories, including that Malia was "among 10 arrested in racist Antifa attack" and that she was expelled from Harvard, and that Sasha drove an expensive car into a lake. It is a hoax that Malia Obama was suspended from Harvard for writing a paper imagining a world without white people. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-02946	"In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/29/maria-sachs/state-senator-says-texting-now-tops-alcohol-leadin/	On the first day of Florida’s new texting-while-driving ban, state Sen. Maria Sachs, the Senate Democratic leader pro-tem, was already announcing a proposal to make the law tougher. The new law makes texting while driving a secondary offense, which means an officer can’t ticket a motorist only for typing or reading messages while behind the wheel. Rather, the driver has to first commit another violation, like swerving or running a red light. Sachs, of Delray Beach, has filed a bill to make texting while driving a primary offense, which she argues will make it easier to enforce. The penalties -- $30 for a first violation -- will remain. At a press conference with AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson to announce her proposed changes, Sachs recited several somber statistics. We decided to fact-check this claim: "In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths." There’s little doubt that texting is a danger in automobile safety. A 2006 study by David Strayer and Frank Drews at the University of Utah found that people are just as impaired when they drive and talk on a cell phone as they are when they drive intoxicated at the legal blood-alcohol limit of 0.08 percent. The report, which looked at talking on handheld or hands-free cell phones and not texting, concluded that using a cell phone while driving "can be as profound as those associated with driving while drunk." But is it true that in 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths? When we contacted Sachs’ office, her legislative chief of staff said the information came from an op-ed piece AutoNation’s Mike Jackson wrote for the Tampa Bay Times and from news articles about a study done by the Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Long Island, N.Y. The statistic quoted by Sachs has appeared in various media outlets, including CBS and Newsday, but the study’s chief researcher, Dr. Andrew Adesman, said the media "wrongly attributed" the drinking-texting conclusions to his team’s studies, a bit of misinformation that has continued to spread. Adesman said his research team analyzed CDC data -- the 2011 "Youth Risk Behavior Survey" The study found that 45 percent of U.S. high school students 16 and up (46 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls) reported texting while driving during the previous 30 days. The study suggested that the number could actually be a lot higher, given that 75 percent of teens now have cell phones. The study, however, didn’t directly compare texting and drinking while driving, which makes Sachs’ conclusion questionable. The study found a "subgroup" of the students who admit to texting while driving also tended to be involved in other risky behaviors on the road, including not wearing a seatbelt, riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol and drinking and driving. These risk takers were also more likely to smoke marijuana, have unsafe sex and "use indoor tanning devices." The correlation of all these factors makes it difficult to determine what is the "leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths." Indeed, certain aspects of the study didn’t provide much support for proponents of texting laws. Researchers found that while texting while driving was slightly less common in states that prohibit it, "the reality is that millions of teens text while driving," Adesman said. The study didn’t consider the strength of the laws or penalties. Adesman did say there’s reason to be alarmed about the number of teens texting. "Kids aren’t drinking on a regular basis on school days, but they are texting daily." (The CDC reports that high school teens drive after drinking 2.4 times a month.) Sachs said she wants to "change the culture" of texting while driving. "I think our culture has turned against alcohol and driving, so we want to say to kids, ‘you know it’s wrong to drink and drive’ and the same thing has to be said about texting." Another problem for Sachs’ claim: The data isn’t perfect. The involvement of cell phones is still underreported in accidents, said Deb Trombley, senior program manager for transportation initiatives for the National Safety Council. "One challenge is that there isn’t good data. Cell phone use isn’t being recorded on crash reports… It goes down as distracted driving." Jackson’s office said that he discovered the information about texting surpassing drunk driving as a cause of teen driving deaths from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, but staff didn’t have any further details. NHTSA officials said the data they collect suggested the opposite of what Jackson and Sachs claimed. According to the agency, 12 percent of 2,105 teen-aged drivers ages 14 to 18 involved in fatal crashes in 2011 were distracted in some way; 24 percent of those distracted drivers were using a cell phone. By comparison, 20 percent (428) of 14 to 18-year-old drivers involved in a fatal crash in 2011 had some level of alcohol in their system, according to NHTSA. A driving distraction can be anything from adjusting the radio or putting on makeup to eating a burger behind the wheel. With teens, there are often a bunch of noisy friends in the car. Our ruling Sachs’ statistic -- that starting in 2011, texting began surpassing alcohol as the leading contributing factor to teen driving deaths -- was based on a misinterpretation of a scientific study and information from NHTSA that could not be confirmed. In reality, NHTSA’s analysis of their data found that alcohol was involved in more lethal crashes than distracted driving in 2011. While there’s no question that texting while driving is a danger, it hasn’t supplanted alcohol as "the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths." However, the figures are imperfect enough that we can't rule out an undercount in deaths associated with texting while driving. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01038	On assault weapon violence: "Ducks have more protection than people in Virginia."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2015/jan/26/alfonso-lopez/alfonso-lopez-says-va-shields-ducks-better-people-/	When it comes to protection from assault weapons in Virginia, Del. Alfonso Lopez said ducks have it better than people. Lopez, D-Arlington, has introduced a bill that would ban the future sale in Virginia of gun magazines that hold more than 20 bullets. It has a grandfather clause that would allow those who owned higher-capacity magazines prior to the signing of his bill to keep three of the devices. The grandfathered owners would have to register those magazines with the state police. In a Jan. 19 floor speech, Lopez said his bill is a response to mass shootings around the nation in recent years, including the 2007 Virginia Tech tragedy that left 32 dead and 17 wounded. Then, the delegate made an analogy to hunting. "Since 1931, federal law prohibits me from having more than three shotgun shells in my shotgun when I’m duck hunting," he said. "That means that ducks have more protection than people in Virginia. "Let me repeat that: Under the law, ducks have more protection than people in Virginia," Lopez said. We took a gander at Lopez’s claim. The delegate referred us to federal and state hunting laws. They identically make it illegal to hunt migratory birds with a shotgun capable of firing more than three rounds without reloading. Does that mean ducks are better protected than people under Virginia laws? The very premise of Lopez’s claim is flawed. It’s legal to hunt ducks in Virginia. If you shoot one with a barred firearm for duck hunting, it’s a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum $500 fine. It’s illegal to shoot people in Virginia with any firearm, except in limited instances of self defense. The murder of person in Virginia is punishable by death or lengthy prison sentences. There’s no jail time for shooting a duck, even if it’s done with an illegal shotgun. It’s illegal to even point a gun at another person in Virginia in a menacing way, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison and a $2,500 fine. State law is silent about pointing a gun at a duck. Lopez told us he wasn’t trying to argue that Virginia laws protect ducks better than people from being shot. "I was talking about the number of bullets and shotgun shells," he said, adding that, perhaps, he could have been clearer in his speech. "I was talking about high capacity guns." Our ruling In a speech on the House floor, Lopez said that under Virginia law "ducks have more protection that people" from assault gun violence. To drive the point home, he repeated it. There’s simply no basis to this jarring claim. Virginia sanctions duck hunting; it’s a misdemeanor with no jail time if you shoot one with a gun that can hold more than three bullets. It’s a felony to purposefully shoot a person, sometimes punishable by death, and the capacity of firearms doesn’t alter this simple fact. We rate Lopez’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-04770	"This year, Eric Cantor has received more money from oil companies than any other member of Congress."	false	/virginia/statements/2012/aug/27/wayne-powell/wayne-powell-says-eric-cantor-has-received-most-oi/	Democratic Congressional candidate Wayne Powell is trying to tie Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, to big oil. On his website, Powell claimed, "This year, Eric Cantor has received more money from oil companies than any other member of Congress." When we contacted the campaign, advisor Dave "Mudcat" Saunders said the statement was inaccurate and he took it down. The claim was replaced by, "Eric Cantor has received huge contributions from big oil companies." OpenSecrets.org, the website for the Center for Responsive Politics, tracks campaign donations. Among members of Congress during this election cycle, Cantor ranks No. 10. His $187,250 from the oil and gas industry groups trails Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who topped the list with $358,200. Others who surpass Cantor in oil and gas money are Rep. Rick Berg, R-N.D.; Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Mont.; Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio; Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.; Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., and Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich. Among House members, he ranks No. 7. In the 2009-10 cycle, he ranked 18th. Cantor’s campaign committee had raised $6.3 million and spent $5.1 million as of July 30. That ranks No. 4 among current House candidates, behind Boehner, Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Allen West, R-Fla. In his leadership PAC, the Every Republican Is Crucial PAC, Cantor raised $4.4 million and spent nearly all of it. Oil and gas industry groups donated $68,650 to his PAC. Powell’s campaign has apologized for the inaccurate claim and changed the statement, which we encourage others to do when they realize their claims aren’t up to snuff. Our ruling The Powell campaign accused Cantor of having collected more money from oil and gas industry folks than any other member of Congress. They quickly acknowledged that the statement was false and changed it. We applaud them for changing the claim, but we still have to rate the original one. The claim was False.

pomt-04066	Says Ohio’s economic recovery "started in February 2010."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/24/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-says-ohios-economic-turnaround-bega/	Ted Strickland is out. But don’t for a minute think the former Ohio governor’s record won’t remain a club in the bag of Republican incumbent John Kasich’s re-election campaign next year. So while removing himself this month from the Democratic gubernatorial sweepstakes in 2014, Strickland was sure to put a positive spin on his own four years at the Statehouse. "With the help of President Obama, who provided the funds necessary to keep Ohio and all of America from slipping into another Great Depression, we were able to preserve the social safety net, make important investments in education, and position Ohio’s economy for the recovery that started in February 2010," Strickland said in an email distributed by the Ohio Democratic Party. Kasich won a close contest in 2010 by emphasizing the state’s economic decline on Strickland’s watch. Since then, a steady drop in Ohio unemployment figures has been seen as helpful to Obama’s re-election last year and to Kasich’s improved standing in public opinion polls. As speculation shifted to other Democratic prospects, the sentiment Strickland clearly hoped to convey with his statement was that Republicans do not deserve all the credit for recovery in the state. But is the sentiment rooted in accuracy or revisionist history? PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. Luckily we were quite familiar with Strickland’s assertion, as it has been a key talking point for Democrats. We confirmed with Jerid Kurtz, communications director for the state party, that it was based primarily on unemployment numberstallied by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the seven months encompassing July 2009 through January 2010, Ohio’s unemployment rate was at a 10-year high of 10.6 percent, according to the BLS. In February 2010, the rate dropped to 10.5 percent -- the first month-to-month decrease since November 2007. After February 2010, the state’s monthly unemployment rate continued to decline for a year, then leveled between 8.8 and 8.9 percent in mid-2011 before dropping again. Preliminary numbers for December 2012place the unemployment rate at 6.7 percent, the lowest since July 2008. As additional backup, Kurtz pointed to a March 2011 BLS release, which notes employment boosts in several sectors during 2010, Strickland’s last year in office. Manufacturing jobs, for example, increased by 9,300 jobs between January 2010 and December 2010. Employment in education and health services grew by 12,300 jobs over the same period. (Other sectors lost jobs, including financial activities, which reported 5,200 fewer jobs at the end of the year.) This is not the first time Democrats have argued that the state’s economy was rosier than Kasich implied in 2010. Strickland’s budget director, Pari Sabety, said in November 2010 that the economy was "on the mend" and "in better shape than when we took office." PolitiFact Ohio evaluated that claimand talked to economic experts who disputed the "better shape" part of Sabety’s statement. The experts said employment figures are the true measure of the health of a state’s economy. At the time 350,000 fewer Ohioans had jobs than when Strickland took office. But two of the experts believed at least a modest recovery was afoot. Sabety’s claim rated a Half True on the Truth-O-Meter. We reconnected with Ken Mayland, an economist with Pepper Pike’s ClearView Economics and one of the experts cited in the check of Sabety’s November 2010 statement. Mayland said that employment numbers offer a clearer picture of an economy because they measure who is working. The unemployment rate excludes those who have stopped searching for work. Mayland said it’s likely the tide began to turn for Ohio as early as 2009, when the national recession ended according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Our check of BLS data shows that after months of decline, the number of employed Ohioans began climbing in January 2010. Employment dipped again that summer but was rebounding by fall. Nearly 30,000 more Ohioans were employed in December 2010 than at the beginning of the year. Under Kasich, Ohio’s employment ranks have grown by another 80,000, according to the BLS. We also checked in with Cleveland economic research analyst George Zeller, another expert. Zeller finds fault with the BLS model favored by others and prefers the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. Zeller said the QCEW numbers show that Ohio began gaining jobs in 2010, but several months later than February. If he had to pick a month when the Ohio economy began to turn around, Zeller said he would choose July 2010 or October 2010. "In the end," Zeller wrote in an email to PolitiFact Ohio, "more than a third of all the net jobs gained in Ohio during 2010 were in October 2010." Strickland, in announcing he would sit out in 2014, said Ohio’s economic recovery "started in February 2010." The Ohio Democratic Party, which circulated the release, attributed the remark to BLS figures that showed the first in a series of unemployment declines came that month. Economics is never so simple. One expert thinks the recovery might have started earlier, another believes it started a few months later. Strickland served from 2007 through 2010. The timeline might not be as precise as he suggests, but evidence and expertise confirm the accuracy of his larger point: that Ohio’s recovery started while he was governor. There’s also the matter of Strickland clearly attempting to share credit for the recovery with Obama, whose support of an auto industry bailout was seen as crucial to Ohio’s economy. "No governor," Mayland said, "gets blame for the national recession, so no governor should get the credit for the recovery. You can have policies on the margins that help you do a little better." PolitiFact Ohio understands that as long as politics exist, politicians will take credit and assign blame for fluctuations in the economy. It was Kasich, after all, who repeatedly dinged Strickland for hundreds of thousands of lost jobs. The issue is likely to remain a key talking point in the 2014 gubernatorial race. So if Strickland and his Democratic allies must resort to the 2010 recovery to defend themselves, they would better serve the truth by not singling out a month. As is, Strickland’s claim requires clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, that makes it Mostly True.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2013-01-24T06:00:00	2013-01-08	['None']
pomt-03758	Assertions that it makes no difference whether children are raised by heterosexual or homosexual parents have been "shattered by the latest and best social science and research."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/07/susan-yoshihara/same-sex-marriage-foe-says-latest-research-has-sha/	Supporters and opponents of bills to legalize same-sex marriage argued for more than 12 straight hours recently before the Rhode Island Senate’s Judiciary Committee. One of the many issues on which they disagreed was the consequences, if any, of same-sex couples raising children. "It's true some people claim that it doesn't make a difference whether a child is raised by a mother and father or whether she's raised by adults engaged in homosexual lifestyles," said Susan Yoshihara, director of research at the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute, who testified against same-sex marriage. "Some go even further and say that two lesbians might make better parents than a mother and a father, and there was a study that came out a few years ago that pointed to that effect as well. But any scholarly basis for those claims has been shattered by the latest and best social science and research." We wondered what recent research she was referring to and whether it really "shattered" previous findings. First, some background. According to the 2010 Census, there were 131,729 same-sex married households and 514,735 unmarried same-sex households in the United States. Thirty-one percent of the married couples and almost 14 percent of the unmarried couples said they were raising children. Nearly 2 million children under age 18 were being raised by at least one gay or lesbian parent, the census estimated. There have been numerous peer-reviewed studies of same-sex couples raising children. Supporters of same-sex marriage say one of the best grew out of the National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study, which, since 1986, has been following 154 lesbian mothers who had children through artificial insemination. Researchers questioned 39 boys and 39 girls raised by those couples and compared responses with those of equal numbers of boys and girls raised by a mother and father. Their findings were published in 2012 in the Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics. "Our results revealed that the [children of the lesbian couples] rated themselves comparably to their counterparts in opposite-sex parent families in" quality of life, the study concluded. In March 2013, the 60,000-member American Academy of Pediatrics announced it supports same-sex marriage. In its journal, Pediatrics, it said that "extensive data from more than 30 years of research reveal that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social, psychological, and sexual health despite economic and legal disparities and social stigma." SO WHAT WAS the research that, according to Yoshihara, changed the landscape of scholarly thinking on the issue, shattering the past studies? We contacted Yoshihara, who provided links to two recent studies. One was by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas-Austin. Regnerus’ study, published in July 2012 in Social Science Research, asserted that many previous studies finding "no notable disadvantages" and/or "no differences" for children raised in same-sex families relied on sample sizes that were too small or were biased. And he said they often relied on interviews of the same-sex parents, not the children. Regnerus’ New Family Structures Study used a questionnaire on a range of topics to interview just under 3,000 people ages 18 to 39 and asserted that some outcomes were worse for children of same-sex parents. It compared the children of "lesbian mothers" and "gay fathers" with the children of "intact" heterosexual couples. The study looked at everything from whether the children had thought about suicide to whether they voted in the last presidential election. It found, for instance, that the children of lesbian mothers were more likely to be have been in therapy, a link that was not true for children of gay fathers. Yoshihara also cited a paper by Loren Marks, a professor at Louisiana State University, which Social Science Research also published online in July 2012, which raised similar criticisms of previous studies. THE REGNERUS STUDY'S methods and conclusions touched off a firestorm of criticism from same-sex marriage supporters and from social scientists from around the country. Two hundred researchers signed a letter to Social Science Research, attacking the "intellectual merit" of the Regnerus study. James D. Wright, editor-in-chief of Social Science Research, asked yet another scholar on the journal’s editorial board to review the Regnerus study and determine whether it was proper to have published it. That scholar, Darren E. Sherkat, a Southern Illinois University sociology professor, found many shortcomings. Among them: the Regnerus study included among its gay parents people who had a same-sex relationship at any time, even if it was one experience and even if the people involved did not raise the child together. Sherkat was also asked to review the companion paper by Marks and he concluded it was essentially a review of other studies and "inappropriate for a journal that published original quantitative research." Sherkat also found that reviewers of both papers failed to disclose conflicts of interest, including being paid consultants on the Regnerus study. "Both papers have serious flaws and distortions that were not simply ignored, but lauded in the reviews," Sherkat wrote. Meanwhile, 27 scholars from various universities signed a letter defending the Regnerus study. SO WHERE ARE WE in this academic free-for-all? Two things are clear: * There is a sharp division among scholars and advocates over the issue of same-sex parenting * The Regnerus study hasn’t been widely accepted as "the best" research on the topic and has not reordered the social-science world in the way Yoshihara suggests. Wright, the Social Science Research editor-in-chief, put it best: "I would regard ‘shattered by the latest and best social science research’ as something of an overstatement," he said in an e-mail A prudent scholar, he said, would conclude that "the question is by no means settled, either by the literature as a whole or by the Regnerus study, the latter having far too many problems and issues to be considered ‘definitive.’" We rule Yoshihara’s claim False.

pomt-06950	"The black unemployment rate (has) increased since the recovery has begun."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/18/marc-morial/marc-morial-says-black-unemployment-has-actually-w/	During a discussion of high unemployment on the July 17, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, turned the spotlight on unemployment among African Americans. "We have a jobs crisis in America," said Morial, the former mayor of New Orleans, "and I think that the debt-ceiling discussion should be decoupled from the deficit discussion, and the nation needs a jobs plan. We have 14 million people out of work. The black unemployment rate is at stifling levels. It's, in fact, increased since the recovery has begun. " We decided to check whether the black unemployment rate has gotten worse since the recovery began. We looked at federal Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers starting in June 2009 -- the month the National Bureau of Economic Research determined was the end of the last recession and the start of the recovery. In June 2009, the unemployment rate for African Americans was 14.9 percent. In the most recent month, June 2011, the rate was 16.2. So the black unemployment rate definitely did rise over that period. If you look closer at the numbers, they have actually zig-zagged a bit. The rate peaked at 16.5 percent in March and April 2010, before falling as low as 15.3 percent in February 2011. Since then, the rate has climbed almost a full percentage point over four months. Still, in the period Morial specified, the black unemployment rate increased by more than a full percentage point. We should note that Morial has some justification for focusing on black unemployment rates. Of the four major ethnic groups tracked by BLS -- whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asian Americans -- only blacks saw unemployment rise over the period Morial cited. White unemployment dropped from 8.7 percent to 8.1 percent from June 2009 to June 2011. Hispanic unemployment dropped from 12.2 percent to 11.6 percent. And Asian unemployment dropped from 8.2 percent to 6.8 percent. All told, the overall unemployment rate fell from 9.5 percent to 9.2 percent. In fact, some segments of the black labor force showed even higher rates of unemployment. For instance, the most recent unemployment rate for blacks between the ages of 16 and 24 years was 31.4 percent. We find nothing amiss in Morial’s claim that "the black unemployment rate (has) increased since the recovery has begun." So we rate his statement True.

pomt-13113	"In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/nov/03/arizonans-responsible-drug-policy/anti-recreational-marijuana-ad-misleads-claim-newb/	The last-minute contributions opposing an initiative that would legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona continue to pile up, with even Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson shelling out $500,000 against the cause. Much like the money, the ads against recreational marijuana continue to flow as well. An Oct. 11 ad from Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, an anti-pot group, uses testimonies from two former Colorado politicians in highlighting the supposed dangers of recreational marijuana. "In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system," former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb says. This claim stood out to us right away. Could half of all newborn babies tested at this particular hospital really have marijuana in their system? Deceptive data The ad cites a September 2016 report from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area -- an interagency group focused on combating drug trafficking. According to the report, "nearly half" of newborns tested in March 2016 at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center in Pueblo, Colo., tested positive for marijuana. Ciara Archer, a spokeswoman for the anti-pot group, also pointed us to a July 2016 CBS Denver story on the hospital. The article notes that the head of the neonatal unit, Dr. Steve Simerville, is reporting a "dramatic increase" in newborns with marijuana in their system. We reached out to the hospital and dug into the numbers. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, but St. Mary-Corwin spokeswoman Wendi Dammann said babies have been drug tested at the hospital for at least a decade. "The screening criteria was developed by both local hospitals (St. Mary-Corwin and Parkview) and Children’s Hospital Colorado," she said. As far as the numbers cited in the ad, Dammann confirmed that five out of the 11 newborn babies tested in March 2016 did test positive for marijuana. So that’s less than 46 percent -- not half -- of a handful of births in one month. Cherry-picking one month of data makes the number of newborns who test positive for marijuana seem higher than it actually is. That is not the case. From January 2016 through September 2016, 403 babies were born at St. Mary-Corwin. About one-quarter of those, or 101, were tested for marijuana. Of those 101 newborns, 27 tested positive for marijuana in their systems. That’s a rate slightly under 27 percent. And in 2015, the hospital saw 519 births. Of the 93 newborn babies tested for marijuana, 31 came up positive for marijuana. That’s a rate of 33 percent. Marijuana use during and after pregnancy can be quite harmful. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, exposure to THC "could have profound and long-lasting consequences" to a baby’s brain and behavior, including neurological development. We wanted to know how these statistics compared to the country or states where marijuana is not legal, but we could not find much research on that point. However, Dr. Edith Allen of Phoenix Children’s Hospital, studied drug habits for pregnant women with criteria including personal or family history of drug use at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center between 2006 and 2010. Her study found THC in 431 babies out of 727 mother-baby pairings tested -- almost 60 percent. However, Allen pointed out that not every pregnant woman was tested. Our ruling The ad claimed, "In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system." That hospital -- St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center -- did have more than 45 percent of their newborn babies tested test positive for marijuana in their systems. The big issue with the talking point is it cherry-picks one month of data. Overall, from January 2015 through September 2016, almost 1 in 3 newborn babies tested for marijuana at St. Mary-Corwin came up positive for marijuana in their systems. That’s not half, but it’s still pretty high. We rate the ad’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c0486014-62bc-4d7b-a14d-25fb5b447a1d	None	Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy	None	None	None	2016-11-03T16:00:00	2016-10-11	['Colorado']
pomt-12961	Says Donald Trump's first 17 Cabinet appointments "have a net worth of more than a third of America."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/30/mark-pocan/do-17-picks-donald-trumps-cabinet-have-higher-net-/	Critics of President-elect Donald Trump say he promised to "drain the swamp" in Washington but has instead chosen wealthy and connected insiders for his Cabinet. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan joined that chorus during a Dec. 16, 2016 interview on Wisconsin Public Radio. Trump’s first 17 picks for the Cabinet, the Madison Democrat charged, "have a net worth of more than a third of America." They do. But here’s the twist: So might a group of 17 ordinary Americans. Cabinet’s net worth -- $6 billion or more Net worth is the difference between a person’s assets and liabilities. So, things like savings and retirement accounts on one hand, versus what is owed on a home mortgage, credit cards, etc. That means a person with heavy debt can have no net worth, or a negative net worth, even while earning a six-figure income. As for Trump’s Cabinet picks, a number have made news for their wealth. But let’s start with what is the Cabinet. The Cabinet has 16 members who are in the official line of succession to the presidency -- the vice president, plus the heads of 15 executive departments, such as the secretary of state and the secretary of defense. However, seven more positions "have the status of Cabinet-rank." They include the White House chief of staff and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. To back Pocan’s claim, his office cited an article posted the day before his radio interview by a website called Quartz, which describes itself as a news outlet founded in 2012 "for business people in the new global economy." The article examined the wealth of 17 Trump selections -- 13 Cabinet members, plus four Cabinet-rank positions. The article said those 17 people have more than $9.5 billion in combined wealth -- "greater than that of the 43 million least wealthy American households combined -- over one-third of the 126 million households total in the U.S." That $9.5 billion is roughly in the middle of other estimates on the wealth of the Cabinet. On the high end, the Boston Globe, NBC News and CBS News put their estimates at $13 billion to $14 billion. But that includes $5 billion attributed to Todd Ricketts, Trump’s pick for deputy commerce secretary, which is not a Cabinet or Cabinet-rank position, and $5 billion for Trump’s choice for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, a number that has its own problems. On the low end of the estimates is $6 billion, from Bloomberg. Bloomberg doesn’t count Ricketts. And it estimates DeVos’ net worth as only $130 million, not $5 billion. Both Bloomberg and Forbes point out that the $5 billion is the estimated worth of Richard DeVos, Betsy’s father-in-law and the co-founder of Amway, not Betsy DeVos’ wealth. The other wealthiest Trump Cabinet picks and their estimated net worth, according to Bloomberg: investor Wilbur Ross Jr., the choice for Commerce secretary, $2.9 billion; Linda McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment chief executive officer and Trump’s choice for administrator of the Small Business Administration, $1.4 billion; and financier Steve Mnuchin, the choice for Treasury secretary, $655 million. One-third of U.S. households It almost doesn’t matter, however, whether the net worth of Trump’s Cabinet is $6 billion or more. That’s because one-third of American households combined -- which includes households with extreme negative net worth -- have essentially no net worth. Pocan’s claim, said University of California, Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, director of the school’s Center for Equitable Growth, "is a pretty meaningless statement" because "the bottom one-third of American households ranked by wealth own approximately nothing -- some have negative wealth, some have very low wealth." One reason for gaps in wealth is income inequality. The Urban Institute think tank, using the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances data, found that families near the top had a 70 percent increase in income from 1963 to 2013, while the income of families at the bottom stayed roughly the same. In fact, the bottom one-third of American households have a combined net worth of negative $50 billion, Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, told us -- though that is misleading in that it includes relatively few households with extreme negative net worth. If you exclude those households, the vast majority of households in the bottom third have a net worth of about $3.7 billion. So, if Trump's 17 Cabinet picks have a combined net worth of $6 billion or more, their net worth is greater than the least wealthy one-third of American households. But if the bottom one-third actually has a negative net worth, any 17 ordinary Americans who have a net worth of at least $1 would have a higher net worth than one-third of Americans. Our rating Pocan says Trump's first 17 Cabinet appointments "have a net worth of more than a third of America." One-third of American households have a combined net worth of roughly zero. So, the combined net worth of Trump Cabinet members is greater, but so is that of any American who has a net worth of more than zero. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8a023f85-18f0-46c6-afaf-51178c79b199 Recent fact checks on wealth → While campaigning in Madison for Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Bernie Sanders claimed Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax would mean the Walmart Walton family would "get a $53 billion tax break."

pomt-03475	"There hasn’t been a Republican in the legislature or the City Council in Providence in over 30 years."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/14/bernard-jackvony/bernard-jackvony-says-providence-has-not-elected-r/	It’s no revelation that Republicans are scarce at the General Assembly, Rhode Island’s most powerful political body. And some say that lack of partisan diversity in the Democrat-dominated legislature is unhealthy for the body politic. That was a point made by longtime Republican Bernard Jackvony, former state GOP chairman, lieutenant governor and unsuccessful candidate for governor, who was a panelist on the May 31 broadcast of Rhode Island Public Television’s "A Lively Experiment." "I say to people in Providence who have been complaining for 50 or 60 years, ‘Why don’t you try something different, because your schools aren’t getting better, your neighborhoods aren’t necessarily getting better, job opportunities aren’t getting better. Why do you vote for the Democrat?’" Jackvony said. "There hasn’t been a Republican in the legislature or the City Council in Providence in over 30 years." Is the GOP desert that vast in the capital city, we wanted to know. We phoned Paul R. Campbell, Providence city archivist, whose desk is perched in the attic at City Hall, and dropped in on Claudia J. Haugen, chairwoman of the Providence Board of Canvassers and Registration, who is on the first floor. Institutional memory told us that lawyer Malcolm Farmer III was the last Republican on the council, but we were unsure just when he left office. And we thought Jackvony might be in for a surprise regarding the legislature. Haugen reported there are 100,253 active registered voters, of which 60,627, or 60 percent, are Democrats. The rest are: 34,402 unaffiliated, or 34.3 percent; 4,950 Republican, or 4.94 percent; and 274 Moderate Party, or .76 percent. Until the 1980s the Republicans were influential on the affluent East Side, especially in Ward 2. But the East Side, too, has turned deep blue. We asked Campbell to identify the last Republican council member. He assigned archival assistant Caleb Horton to take what he said would be the quickest research route: poring over, ahem, old Providence Journal-Bulletin Almanacs, where the certified results of elections were published. For the last Republican General Assembly member from Providence, we turned to state librarian Thomas R. Evans, who consulted lists published by the Joint Committee on Legislative Services. Their answers: Farmer served from 1979 through 1990, when he opted not to seek reelection, representing Ward 2 as the last Republican on the council -- 22½ years ago. And Mary C. Ross represented the old House District 17, in the West End, for one term in 1993-94 -- 19½ years ago. Both were considerably more recent than Jackvony’s remark that it has been "over 30 years." "As they say in the State House, close enough for government work," Jackvony quipped, when we called him with the results of our research. He attributed the Republican eclipse in Providence to demographic and social changes similar to those that have occurred in many urban areas. Jackvony, in his statement on "A Lively Experiment," was making the point that it has been a long time since a Republican sat on the council or represented the city in the Assembly. While he said over 30 years, it’s in fact 19½. His overall point may have been sound, but his numbers weren’t. The judges rule Mostly False.

pomt-09489	Says one in three Texas children drop out of high school.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/25/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-one-third-kids-drop-out/	In a TV ad titled "Honest Leadership," U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican candidate for governor, courts voters by painting a bleak picture of Texas under Gov. Rick Perry. Between swipes on taxes ("too high") and the Texas Department of Transportation ("a wasteful mess"), Hutchison says that one in three Texas children are "dropping out." The senator is not the only candidate airing such a claim. On a campaign flier, Rebecca Bell-Metereau, a local Democratic candidate for the State Board of Education, says that "one-third of our students don’t graduate from high school." Dropout rates are such a complicated subject that we wondered if a simple statistic tells the whole story. First, researchers and governments have many different ways of measuring how many students leave school before graduating. Analyzing different data with different methods yields statistical results that vary — a lot. To add to the confusion, any of those measurements might be termed the "dropout" rate in public discourse, depending on who is wielding the terminology. Another source of confusion: Everyone who does not graduate is not necessarily a dropout. Graduation rates involve different data. Here, we'll focus on counting dropouts. The "one in three" statistic that Hutchison and others cite refers to what is called the attrition rate, which tracks the decline in enrollment between one year and a later one: for example, the number of students in ninth grade compared with the number three school years later. Hutchison’s campaign pointed us to several news stories that quoted the nonprofit Intercultural Development Research Association in San Antonio, which has its roots in the legal fight for school funding equity. The association, which has tracked high-school completion rates for more than 20 years, calculated a state attrition rate of 31 percent for the class of 2009 and 33 percent for the class of 2008 — hence, fuel for Hutchison's one-in-three claim. IDRA says attrition rates are an "indicator of a school’s holding power, or the ability to keep students enrolled in school and learning until they graduate." However, Linda Roska, director of the Texas Education Agency’s division of accountability research, said attrition rates are a simplistic measure because, among other things, they don't distinguish between students who actually dropped out and those who left for reasons such as moving to another state or graduating early. While TEA publishes a high school attrition rate (28.6 percent for the class of 2008, the most recent data available), it is not used in the state’s school accountability system. Lori Taylor, an associate professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, said the best way to calculate dropout rates is to track individual students over time. That's what TEA says it does when calculating two dropout rates that it uses: the percentage of high school students who drop out in a single year (3.2 percent in 2007-8) and the percentage of students in each class who drop out of high school before graduating (10.5 percent for the class of 2008). Both measurements are far below the "one in three" rate that Hutchison claims. However, a 2009 report by Taylor’s students at Texas A&M says that the one-year rate potentially creates "a distorted picture that underestimates the average dropout rate of a school, district, or system." And the long-term rate excludes students who stay in high school longer than four years and may drop out later. So what does "dropping out" really mean? According to TEA, a student becomes a dropout if he or she does not return to public school in the fall, is not expelled and does not do one of the following: graduate, receive a GED, continue school outside the public school system, begin college or die. Some academics, researchers and activists have long disputed the agency's dropout numbers, partly because they said TEA excluded many students who should have been counted as dropouts. For instance, students who said they intended to get a GED after leaving school were not considered dropouts. Since the state adopted the federal dropout definition several years ago, those students are now considered dropouts if they fail to obtain their GED within a limited time frame — and the state's official dropout rates have gone up. All this goes to show the difficulty that researchers have in trying to pin down dropout statistics precisely. In fact, the Bush School projected the dropout rate for the class of 2012 will range anywhere from 12.2 percent (40,519 students) to 22.2 percent (73,692 students). That's a lot of wiggle room. Anyway, education experts contacted for this story generally agreed that the debate over whose numbers are best obscures the real issue: Too many Texas students are quitting school, period. "It's most important to focus on the severity of the problem and what are the factors that are contributing to it," said Linda McSpadden McNeil, director of Rice University's Center for Education. Our conclusion? If you ask how many Texas students drop out of school, you’ll get wildly different answers. In our own analysis, we found dropout rates that range from 3 percent (the one-year rate) to 33 percent (the attrition rate), and each one had its defenders. Hutchison's dropout reference is based on student attrition, a simplistic measurement that is not the way the state prefers to count dropouts but is nevertheless accepted by some experts. We find Hutchison's statement Half True.	None	Kay Bailey Hutchison	None	None	None	2010-02-25T16:08:40	2010-02-12	['Texas']
pomt-12495	"Before NAFTA, trade between the US and Mexico was around $50 billion. Now it stands at more than $500 billion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/28/jeff-flake/republican-senator-arizona-cites-growth-us-mexico-/	President Donald Trump has been consistent in criticizing NAFTA -- the North American Free Trade Agreement -- as being a bad deal for America. But not everyone in his own party agrees. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., has delivered a series of strong statements in support of the trade pact between the United States, Mexico and Canada. In a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Flake said NAFTA’s economic benefits can’t be ignored, adding that in 2016 Arizona’s trade with Mexico exceeded $15 billion. "Trade deals like NAFTA make inputs for U.S. manufacturing cheaper than they would otherwise be," Flake said April 27. "Cheaper inputs mean lower production costs for U.S.-based businesses, which in turn allows these companies to expand production and reduce prices." And while NAFTA could be modernized, it has helped both the United States and Mexico, Flake said. Flake shared similar thoughts on Twitter: "Before NAFTA, trade between the US and Mexico was around $50 billion. Now it stands at more than $500 billion. What's not to like?" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We wondered if Flake’s numbers were correct and how much of that growth can be attributed to NAFTA, as his message suggested. We found that his data is largely accurate, but experts say NAFTA does not deserve all of the credit for the trade increase. Trade before and after NAFTA Trump consistently has criticized NAFTA, saying that the United States has not been treated fairly by trade partners Canada and Mexico. He has promised to renegotiate the agreement to better suit the United States. NAFTA initially was negotiated by Republican President George H.W. Bush, who agreed to the trade pact in December 1992 about a month before leaving office. It was then up to Democratic President Bill Clinton to round up support and get it passed through Congress. Clinton signed the bill implementing NAFTA in December 1993. NAFTA went into effect Jan. 1, 1994. Flake’s statement that trade between Mexico and the United States was around $50 billion before NAFTA stems from Census data, his press office said. We found that in 1993, the year before NAFTA became effective, there was a trade flow of about $81.5 billion in goods with Mexico (exports $41.6 billion, imports $39.9 billion). That’s a little higher than Flake said. Flake’s office said that he looked at data around 1988-1989, "using a general time frame" before and after NAFTA to make the comparison. In 1988, trade between the United States and Mexico totaled about $43.9 billion. In 1989, it was $52.1 billion. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The other figure in the Arizona senator’s claim said trade between the two nations now stands at more than $500 billion. That checks out. In 2016, trade was about $525 billion (exports $231 billion, imports $294 billion). NAFTA’s impact Flake hinted that growth in trade was linked to NAFTA. His office did not respond to requests to elaborate on this point. Economists and trade experts told us that while NAFTA can be attributed for some of the increase, there are other factors at play, such as inflation and GDP growth. And there is a lot of debate on NAFTA’s overall economic impact and on the number of jobs that as a result of it have been lost or created. Most of the increase in trade volume between Mexico and the United States is due to NAFTA, said Gerardo Esquivel Hernandez, an economist and professor at El Colegio de Mexico. But part of the dollar increase is also explained by increases in prices and economic activity in both the United States and Mexico, he said. NAFTA facilitated U.S.-Mexico trade growth by lowering tariffs, creating a framework to protect foreign investment, and essentially locking in a series of market-oriented reforms that Mexico made in the 1980s and early 1990s, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. "For nearly 25 years, NAFTA has been the foundation upon which massive trade growth has occurred," Wilson said. But other factors have also contributed, he said. "The most important are geography and growth of the U.S. and Mexican economies," Wilson said. "Unless significant policy barriers prevent it, the most natural thing is for trade to grow between neighboring countries that are each experiencing GDP growth." The trade balance is also worth highlighting as it "has a much more direct impact on the economy than the total volume of trade," said Robert Scott, a senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. Scott said that for about a decade before NAFTA, the United States had a "roughly balanced" trade with Mexico. But it has turned into a deficit after NAFTA, reaching $63.2 billion in 2016. Our ruling Flake tweeted, "Before NAFTA, trade between the US and Mexico was around $50 billion. Now it stands at more than $500 billion." Flake is close on the numbers. NAFTA went into effect in 1994. The year before that, trade between the United States and Mexico was about $81.5 billion, according to Census figures. Flake’s office said he looked at other years, 1988 and 1989, in which trade was closer to $50 billion. Data for 2016 show about $525 billion in trade between the two countries. Economists and trade experts told us that NAFTA has played an important role in trade growth, but several other factors must also be taken into consideration. With those caveats, we rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Jeff Flake	None	None	None	2017-04-28T14:02:48	2017-04-27	['Mexico', 'North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement']
pomt-04408	When Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, he "stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ‘This plant kills.’"	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/16/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-once-said-coal-burning-plant-kil/	Energy policy and gas prices garnered a lot of attention in the town-hall style debate between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Romney accused Obama of stifling domestic production and said he would champion the oil and coal industries. Obama fired back that Romney hasn’t always been such a proponent of coal. "Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ‘This plant kills,’ and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal," Obama said. PolitiFact Ohio has looked into this bit of Bay State history before, rating a statement similar to this one. We’ll recap. The Salem Harbor Power Station Back on Feb. 5, 2003, Romney made several statements during a showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station, in the Boston area. A couple of years earlier, Massachusetts had passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years. The mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. As governor, Romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly. Massachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the "Filthy Five" plants, including Salem Harbor. Public health and environmental scientists at Harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that Salem Harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year. Local residents and others who wanted to keep the Salem Harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenues) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling. It turned out that the Harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from Salem Harbor’s pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald. But the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly. The Harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with. Romney appeared to accept their findings, too. The spat with Salem Harbor turned into a testy exchange after Salem Harbor’s then-owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with Massachusetts’ emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off. Romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004 and appeared at a press conference near the plant to emphasize the point. His statements that day show how he felt, and they’re documented in this video: "I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people, and that plant -- that plant kills people." Our ruling Obama said Romney has changed his tune about coal, claiming that in Massachusetts he "stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ‘This plant kills.’" Romney was the newly elected governor when a showdown erupted over the coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station. Obama quoted Romney accurately when he said the governor entered the controversy by saying the plant "kills people." We rate his statement True.

pomt-15099	"When he (Donald Trump) asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/sep/16/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-said-donald-trump-wanted-casino-gambling-/	During the second GOP debate, Jeb Bush said that Florida stood up to Donald Trump when he tried to bring casino gambling to Florida. Here is part of their testy exchange: Bush: "He wanted casino gambling in Florida -- " Trump: "I didn’t -- " Bush: "Yes, you did." Trump: "Totally false." Bush: "You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to -- " Trump: "I would have gotten it." Bush: " -- casino gambling before -- " Trump: "I promise, I would have gotten it." Bush: " -- during and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody." Trump: "I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it." Later, Bush added, "When he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no." Trump: "Wrong." Did Trump ask to bring casino gambling to Florida, and did Florida under Bush shut him down? Trump’s history on casino gambling in Florida Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined to provide any evidence to refute Bush’s claim. A spokeswoman for Bush referred us to a Sept. 1 CNN article headlined "Jeb Bush: the man who killed Trump’s casino dreams." News reports from the 1990s show that Trump helped finance Bush’s campaign and the state Republican Party during Bush’s 1998 bid for governor -- while Trump was seeking to open casinos in Florida. Trump held a 1997 fundraiser, which reportedly raised $500,000 for Bush when he ran for governor, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. As the race continued the next year, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts donated $50,000 to the Republican Party of Florida, when Trump was pushing the state to allow him to open casinos on Seminole tribal land. The tribe was seeking to open Vegas-style slot machines and poker in casinos, to be managed by Trump. Trump backed a 1998 Seminole proposal to state officials to share gambling revenue with Florida. He also hosted a Seminole leader on his vacation estate that year, reported the Tampa Bay Times. Bush, meanwhile, was already known as an opponent of gambling because he had served on the board of No Casinos, a group that organized a few years earlier to fight casinos in Florida. State Republicans said at the time that donations from gambling interests had no bearing on the party’s agenda. ''It's not like our people say, 'You give us $ 50,000, buddy boy, and this is what you're gonna get,'' said Bob Sparks, Republican Party spokesman, according to a 1998 Sun-Sentinel report. ''Both Jeb Bush and the party have expressed no interest at all in expanding gambling." Bush took office in 1999 and maintained his stance on casinos. "I am opposed to casino gambling in this state, and I am opposed whether it is on Indian property or otherwise," Bush told the Tampa Bay Times in 1999. Bush also threatened to sue to prevent gambling in the state. In 2005, Bloomberg Business wrote a story about Trump’s failed attempt to bring casinos to Florida and his falling out with his consultant Richard T. Fields. (Bloomberg Business drew information from court filings. In 2004, Trump sued Fields in Broward County Circuit Court, and Fields intervened in the bankruptcy of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc.) From Bloomberg Business: "Fields negotiated on Trump's behalf with the Seminoles to build and manage casinos on tribal property. Fields maintains in court documents that Trump was only interested in building ‘Class III’ casinos, offering pure games of chance, such as slot machines, craps, and roulette. When Florida Governor Jeb Bush nixed the idea, ‘Trump directed that the effort be terminated entirely,’ Fields's filings say. "But Fields says Trump gave him the green light to try on his own. That's backed up by an affidavit signed in August from Mallory E. Horne, a lobbyist hired by Trump. Horne testified that he told Trump and Fields in late 1998 that Florida officials wouldn't budge. According to Horne, Trump replied, ‘That's the end of it,’ then told Fields: ‘If you want to try this on your own, Richard, that's fine, but I'm through with it.’ " Our ruling Bush said of Trump, "When he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no." We didn’t find that Trump directly petitioned the state for gambling, but there’s a pile of evidence that Trump was pursuing a deal to operate casinos on Seminole land in Florida. And at the same time, Trump gave money to Bush and the state party during Bush’s 1998 race for governor. Trump said it was "totally false" that he sought casino gambling and failed, but we find that Bush has the better part of this fight. We rate Bush’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-10776	"What happens is people like Warren Buffett — and he says this himself...pay 15 percent on the millions of dollars that they earn from wealth income... while their secretary is paying a higher rate on her work income. It's not right."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/17/john-edwards/rich-man-low-tax/	Warren Buffett doesn't just make oodles of dollars, his tax rate on all that money is lower than that of his underlings. At a June 25, 2007 event supporting Edwards' presidential rival, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Buffett pulled out paperwork and told the crowd it was wrong that he pays a lower rate than his subordinates. On his $46.9-million income for 2006, he said, he paid a 17.7 percent tax rate. His secretary and other staffers had a tax rate that was 32.9 percent on average, Buffett told the crowd. The difference is because of the way the Internal Revenue Service treats different types of income. Most of Buffett's income is from investments such as dividend payments and capital gains on sales of assets, which are taxed at 15 percent. Taxes on capital gains and dividends are lower because corporate profits already are taxed at 35 percent by federal law. Some critics say any tax on individuals for capital gains and dividends amounts to double taxations that hurts the economy. Buffett's employees may end up paying at a higher tax rate because standard, earned income, which is the bulk of their income, is taxed at progressively higher brackets up to 35 percent. Edwards borrowed the Buffett moment at the Clinton event to bolster his argument that the capital gains tax rate is too low. Edwards wants the capital gains rate raised back to 28 percent for people earning more than $200,000, its level before President Bush won lower tax rates.

pomt-13469	Says "76 percent of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/13/william-weld/william-weld-says-76-percent-americans-want-his-th/	The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has a rule about how third-party candidates can make it into the fall debates: They need to reach an average of at least 15 percent support in five preselected national polls. No third-party candidate is on track to meet that requirement yet, but the Libertarian Party ticket of Gary Johnson and William Weld thinks it has a shot, and they’re putting on a big push to make participation in the debates a reality. As part of their effort, Weld recently sought to harness the support of voters who may not be confirmed backers of their ticket but who do at least want to see third-party candidates on the debate stage. "The mission of the Commission on Debates is to educate people about the presidential election," Weld wrote recently during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session he participated in with Johnson. "76 percent of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates. End of argument." Weld later made the same point in a CNN interview with host Michael Smerconish on Sept. 10, saying, "It's very easy to say we should be included in the debates when 76 percent of the people in the United States say they want us in the debates." It turns out that Weld has a point, but he misstated some key details. The Johnson-Weld campaign did not reply to an inquiry for this article. The 76 percent figure comes from a Suffolk University poll conducted for USA Today and released Sept. 1. Here's the relevant question: So Weld was on to something. However, it’s worth noting a few pieces of missing context. First, Weld said that voters in the poll wanted the ticket "by name," but that’s not correct. The question asked, "If a third-party candidate is certified by a majority of state ballots, should he or she be included in the debates this fall?" Second, Weld said, "76 percent of all voters in the United States." In reality, the poll didn’t sample "all voters" -- or even all registered voters. It sampled 1,000 likely voters. Pollsters, especially as Election Day draws near, sometimes use methods, such as respondents’ past voting histories, to filter out the voters who are "likely" to vote. So Weld’s description of the Suffolk poll data overstates the case a bit. And there’s another issue: We found two other polls that specifically mentioned either Johnson-Weld or Johnson alone, and their figures were lower than the one Suffolk found. One is a poll by the web publication Morning Consult that surveyed 2,002 registered voters. It asked, "Should Gary Johnson be included in the presidential debates?" The poll found that 52 percent said yes, 22 percent said no and 26 percent didn’t know or had no opinion. (The same poll asked a similar question of Green Party candidate Jill Stein and found 47 percent support for her inclusion in the debates.) The other poll was of 1,498 likely voters by Quinnipiac University on August 25. It asked, "Do you think that Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for president, should be included in the presidential debates this year, or not?" This poll found that 62 percent said yes, 29 percent said no and 9 percent didn’t know or didn’t answer. So the other two polls that did mention Johnson by name found lower percentages of support for Johnson’s participation in the debates, though both still found majority support. David Paleologos, the director of the Suffolk poll, generally agreed that Weld’s statement left out some important information. "The question was directed to the process of being certified on a majority of state ballots rather than introducing names," he said. He added, though, that the campaign might have some grounds to argue that the poll implicitly refers to them since they are currently the only campaign that will be on all 50 state ballots. Our ruling Weld said that "76 percent of all voters in the United States say they want Johnson-Weld, by name, in the presidential debates." Weld can point to recent a poll with that 76 percent figure, but his description of what it means isn’t entirely correct. It’s a poll of likely voters, not "all voters in the United States," and the question didn’t mention Johnson or Weld "by name." However, a majority of voters do support Johnson’s inclusion in the debates -- a finding that holds in three recent polls on this question Weld's talking point is onto something, but his phrasing misses nuance and overstates the case. So we rate the statement Half True.	None	William Weld	None	None	None	2016-09-13T06:00:00	2016-09-07	['United_States']
pomt-01161	Says Saddam Hussein "had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/14/dick-cheney/cheney-torture-report-saddam-hussein-had-10-year-r/	Former Vice President Dick Cheney has been a consistent defender of past interrogation techniques. "We are castigating the CIA for doing what the president ordered them to do and the Justice Department said was legal," Cheney said on NBC’s Meet the Press, Dec. 14, 2014. For Cheney, the deaths of 3,000 people on 9/11 at the hands of al-Qaida terrorists justified expanded interrogation methods and the subsequent invasion of Iraq. "We got to the point where we were very concerned about the possible linkage between terrorists on the one hand and weapons of mass destruction on the other," Cheney said. "Saddam Hussein had previously had twice nuclear programs going. He produced and used weapons of mass destruction. And he had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida." Cheney and the rest of the administration of President George W. Bush made the link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida a linchpin in its rationale for war. In that light, Cheney’s claim about a 10-year relationship merits a closer look. His statement runs counter to at least two major official inquiries. The 9/11 Commission, an independent, bipartisan body created by Congress and Bush, had the job of writing a complete account of the circumstances surrounding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Among its tasks: Examine the ties between al-Qaida and Hussein’s regime. The commission found isolated contacts over the years between Iraq and al-Qaida terrorists but nothing more. The commission released its report in 2004. "To date we have seen no evidence that these or the earlier contacts ever developed into a collaborative operational relationship," the report said. "Nor have we seen evidence indicating that Iraq cooperated with al-Qaida in developing or carrying out any attacks against the United States." In 2007, the Institute for Defense Analyses, a nonprofit research branch of the Pentagon’s Joint Forces Command, completed its assessment based on over half-a-million captured Iraqi documents. That study "found no ‘smoking gun’ (i.e., direct connection) between Saddam's Iraq and al-Qaida," the analysts wrote. When it suited their goals, both the Hussein regime and al-Qaida leaders might support the same third-party militant groups in different countries, but the researchers said the two parties had little else in common. "To the fundamentalist leadership of al-Qaida, Saddam represented the worst kind of ‘apostate’ regime," they wrote. "A secular police state well practiced in suppressing internal challenges." Al-Qaida had good reason to mistrust Hussein. In the mid 1990s, the Iraqi government cracked down and arrested religious extremists who it saw as a threat to Hussein’s power. Peter Neumann is a professor in the War Studies Department at King’s College in London and the author of several books on terrorism. Neumann called Cheney’s statement "absolutely false." "There was no relationship of any kind, and Vice President Cheney, despite making these claims for more than 10 years now, has failed to present any evidence to support it," Neumann said. "He's, as far as I can see, also the only significant person in the Bush administration that's left making this claim." There are isolated examples where Iraqis operating on their own joined forces with al-Qaida and still maintained contacts with members of the Iraqi military, but there is no sign that the connection was any stronger than that. We tried to reach Cheney through a spokesman and did not hear back. Recently, Cheney said that Hussein either supported or tolerated some fundamentalists who went on to become al-Qaida leaders. The Washington Post Fact Checker looked at Cheney’s evidence in July 2014 and found it lacking. Hussein was ready to encourage extremists when he thought they would destabilize his enemies such as the Kurds in northern Iraq. That’s not the sort of relationship that would tie Iraq to the 9/11 attacks. Our ruling Cheney said Hussein had a 10-year relationship with al-Qaida. Two comprehensive, high-level government reports largely refute that statement. That includes one Pentagon study that relied on a trove of secret Iraqi government documents that fell into American hands after the invasion. While there are cases where the two interests overlapped, there is no evidence of a deep-rooted, meaningful relationship over 10 years as Cheney claimed. We rate his statement False.

pomt-12905	"Businesses are leaving Illinois. I think, statistically, that can be proven to be false through the Bureau of Labor Statistics. No net businesses left Illinois."	false	/illinois/statements/2017/jan/19/jason-keller/afl-cio-director-points-to-untraceable-data/	More people are leaving Illinois than any other state in the country. Recently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows Illinois experienced the biggest mid-year population loss of any state between 2015 and 2016. In the past year, 37,508 people left Illinois, making it one of seven states that saw a population drop. Does that mean businesses are leaving, too? According to the Illinois AFL-CIO’s legislative director Jason Keller, businesses are actually sticking around. Keller countered a claim often made by business groups that businesses and jobs are leaving Illinois and perpetuating the overall population loss. Keller said: "I would like to challenge something one of the members here spoke to, that businesses are leaving Illinois. I think, statistically, that can be proven to be false through the Bureau of Labor Statistics. No net businesses have left Illinois." We investigated whether this Bureau of Labor Statistics data existed and could support Keller’s claim. The context The cost of workers' compensation insurance for businesses in Illinois has been one of the lightning rod issues in Illinois politics since Gov. Bruce Rauner took office two years ago. Rauner, business groups, and Republicans in the General Assembly say Illinois' system is slanted heavily against businesses and has contributed to an exodus of businesses to neighboring states with lower workers' compensation insurance rates. During a debate on a workers' compensation reform bill, Rep. Dwight Kay, R-Glen Carbon, cited Illinois' No. 8 ranking in a study of state's compensation premium index rates from the Oregon Department of Consumer Business Services. Kay linked it to recent population loss figures and suggested the state might continue to see people, and eventually businesses, move out of state. "How many employees are going to be left because employers leave?" Kay asked one witness. When it was Keller’s turn to speak, he tried to dismantle Kay’s assertion that businesses are leaving Illinois, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data and saying there was no net loss of Illinois businesses. Digging into BLS data We asked Keller where he obtained this BLS business data. We also asked him to clarify the time frame he was referring to. At the time of the hearing, he said no net businesses left Illinois, but he did not say when. He responded that it’s on the BLS website and instructed us to "run the reports." When we couldn't find BLS data on business departures, we contacted the bureau's economist, Drake Gibson. Gibson said BLS doesn't track interstate relocations of businesses. "We track things like business deployment dynamics, net losses and jobs, closures and openings. But we don’t show businesses leaving from one state to another," Gibson said. Gibson suggested we contact the Illinois Department of Employment Security. We contacted IDES along with several other public and private organizations. None of them track when businesses leave the state. Is this data even available? Keller’s claim raises another question: Does anyone track the movement of Illinois businesses when they cross state lines? Darren Lubotsky, associate professor with an expertise in the American labor market at the Institute of Government & Public Affairs at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, said the data Keller referred to is loosely available, but no organization actually cobbles it together into a comprehensive report. For example, Lubotsky said if someone was interested enough they could use U.S. Census Bureau data to find this information. Or, if they had the means, someone could track Social Security or tax identification numbers to see where businesses were located over the course of time. Lubotsky said that information isn’t neatly packaged. An interested party would have to check each business individually by year. Lubotsky said he’s always skeptical when people make claims similar to the one Keller made. "People like to use the latest population estimates kind of like a score," Lubotsky said. "Using population numbers or businesses figures are the types of things people cherry pick to make their point. I’ve never seen any serious analysis of these sort of things." Even if Illinois was losing a net number of businesses, he said it’s more important to view Illinois’ economic landscape as a whole. "We always hear about manufacturing jobs leaving the state. Maybe that’s the case, but maybe they’re being replaced by IT firms," Lubotsky said. "The net number of businesses might be lower, but the businesses might be higher in productivity." Lubotsky makes a point. While no known organizations track when a business moves across state lines, BLS does track the net number of businesses in each state. According to employment and wages data, Illinois businesses were growing for nearly a decade before declining in 2015. These figures, however, indicate only the total number of businesses year to year. They offer no insight on business departures to other states. Our ruling During a House Labor & Commerce Committee meeting, the Illinois AFL-CIO’s legislative director Jason Keller said, "I would like to challenge something one of the members here spoke to, that businesses are leaving Illinois. I think, statistically, that can be proven to be false through the Bureau of Labor Statistics. No net businesses have left Illinois." We reached out to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, where an economist told us BLS does not track when businesses move in and out of state. We contacted several other private and public organizations we thought might track this data. What Keller said would be at BLS was neither there nor anywhere else we checked. Someone wishing to track and compile business moves would need individual business records or tax identification numbers to do so, Lubotsky said. Based on the lack of evidence and the impracticality of compiling the numbers Keller said could be found at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we rate his claim False.

pomt-07539	"We lost more jobs in this great recession than the last four recessions combined."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/04/george-will/george-will-says-most-recent-recession-killed-more/	During the April 3, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, columnist George Will said during the show’s roundtable segment that "we lost more jobs in this great recession than the last four recessions combined." We knew the most recent recession was bad, but we hadn’t realized it was so bad in comparison to other recent recessions. So we decided to check whether Will was right. We turned to two sources. One is the National Bureau of Economic Research, an independent group of economists that is the de facto arbiter of when recessions begin and end. The other is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates all manner of employment figures. Below we list the last five recessions as declared by the NBER, along with the difference in U.S. non-farm employment levels between the official start of the recession and the official end: Jan. 1980 to July 1980: 968,000 jobs lost July 1981 to Nov. 1982: 2,824,000 jobs lost July 1990 to March 1991: 1,249,000 jobs lost March 2001 to Nov. 2001: 1,599,000 jobs lost Total jobs lost in the four prior recessions: 6,640,000 "Great Recession" -- Dec. 2007 to June 2009: 7,490,000 jobs lost So the numbers show that Will is right -- about 850,000 more jobs were lost during the great recession than in the previous four recessions combined. We wondered, though, whether the result would be different if we factored in the size of the labor force, which has grown over the past three decades. It’s impossible to make the same exact comparison Will did -- that is, comparing the sum of the past four recessions with the current one -- because you can’t simply add together percentages drawn from different time periods. But we thought we’d at least see whether the 2007-2009 recession registered more jobs lost on a percentage basis than any of the prior ones. Here are the numbers for jobs lost as a percentage of the labor force: Jan. 1980 to July 1980: 1.0 percent July 1981 to Nov. 1982: 3.1 percent July 1990 to March 1991: 1.1 percent March 2001 to Nov. 2001: 1.2 percent "Great Recession" -- Dec. 2007 to June 2009: Recession decreased jobs by 5.4 percent So job losses in the "Great Recession" have, on a percentage basis, exceeded those in each of the past four recessions.

pomt-06282	"I have sent over $400 million to the border of Mexico in the form of Texas Ranger recon teams."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/nov/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-hes-sent-400-million-border-ranger/	As he campaigns for president, Texas Gov. Rick Perry speaks often of his experience in directing security dollars and operations along the Texas/Mexico border. Repeatedly in the first three months of his bid for the White House, Perry has mentioned sending $400 million to the border. Sometimes he states it broadly; e.g., "a total of $400 million of state security operations." But often, he pegs the amount to a force he helped create in 2009: Texas Ranger Reconnaissance Teams. At an Oct. 1, 2011, event in Hampton, N.H., Perry said, "I have sent over $400 million to the border of Mexico in the form of Texas Ranger recon teams." He’s used such a formulation at least three times since he entered the race in September -- including onstage at the Sept. 12 GOP debate -- so we decided to dig in. Rewind: On Sept. 10, 2009, Perry announced the recent creation of Ranger Reconnaissance Teams that he said would operate in high-traffic, high-crime areas along the Texas-Mexico border -- a move he described as the state’s latest effort to fill gaps left by the federal government’s "failure to adequately secure" the border. Perry said the recon teams would be "individuals that can stay on the move. We can stay one jump ahead of the cartels and beat them at their own game." According to a subsequent Department of Public Safety report, the teams were being used for "emergencies and other situations that require a specialized law enforcement response ... to locations throughout the state to" head off or deal with "criminal or terrorist incidents that could impact public safety." The report also says the teams are trained in tracking, night-vision equipment, air operations and surveillance; can operate for extended periods in remote, rugged areas; and can include National Guard counter-drug and other personnel. More details proved hard to come by. An Aug. 26, 2010, Associated Press news story says the DPS declined to share mission reports, citing operational security. And what about Perry’s proclaimed $400 million for those boots on the ground? Perry’s campaign and his state office provided budget figures indicating that he signed into law nearly $415 million in spending on border security covering September 2005 through August 2013, meaning fiscal years 2006 through 2013. Lucy Nashed in Perry’s state office directed us to the agencies that received the appropriations for details. Most of the money flows through DPS, and agency spokesman Tom Vinger gave us figures indicating that Texas allocated border security funds for 2006-13 (with the 2011-13 amounts being estimated) totaling $475.6 million, and spent $462.1 million. That amount is spread over a wide range of border operations, not just Ranger recon. Legislative Budget Board spokesman John Barton found us figures for the totals spent on Ranger border security operations in 2009 ($0.4 million) and 2010-11 ($2.6 million). Of that, Barton said, $1.8 million was spent in 2010-11 to create 10 Ranger recon team positions. According to state budgets, there were no dollars appropriated specifically for border operations by Rangers in 2006-07; such appropriations in subsequent years were: 2008-09: $982,595 for five officers’ salaries and costs. 2010-11: $2.8 million -- $1.8 million for 10 new Ranger positions; $1 million for five officers’ salaries and costs. 2012-13: From $38.9 million in border security funds and $48.9 million in local border security, an unspecified amount for Ranger positions. The State Auditor’s Office said in a 2009 report that as of Nov. 30, 2008, Texas had spent just over half the dollars set aside for border security in 2006-09 -- that is, $79 million of the $142.3 million appropriated in those two budgets. However, the audit says, between $7.6 million and $10 million was spent outside the border on officers, new vehicles, radio security devices and a helicopter. So although more than $140 million was targeted for border security in 2006-2009 budgets, not all made it to the border. Spokesman Michael Stiernberg told us the auditor’s office has not examined more recent spending. Let’s tote up what we have. Texas has spent more than $1.8 million on Ranger recon teams, but well below $400 million. So when Perry uses a formulation like "$400 million … in the form of Ranger recon teams," he’s way off. As we closed out this research, Nashed said Perry consistently says the $400 million was spent on border security overall, but at the Hampton stop, he left out some of what that spending has covered. We agree. And while we could not pin precisely how much has been spent on the border reconnaissance teams, we’re comfortable concluding it’s nowhere near the $400 million aired by the governor.

pomt-00106	Says "Dan McCready wants to repeal tax cuts that saves (sic) you $1,300" per year.	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/29/freedomworks/fact-checking-ad-dan-mccready-and-tax-cut-savings/	The biggest policy success of President Donald Trump’s first year was signing the sweeping tax reform bill, something Republicans had been striving for decades to achieve. Now, just one week before the first midterm elections since Trump took office, Republicans across the country are trying to remind voters of the tax cuts their bill ushered in. In the race for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, which stretches from south Charlotte east to include Lumberton and up the Interstate 95 corridor to Fayetteville, a new Facebook ad has leveled criticism at Democrat Dan McCready for his stance on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as the reform bill was called. "Dan McCready wants to repeal tax cuts that saves (sic) you $1,300+/year," said the ad, which went live on Facebook on Oct. 24 and was created and paid for by FreedomWorks for America, a libertarian advocacy group. The claim made our eyebrows raise, so we decided to give the ad a closer look. "Dan McCready wants to repeal tax cuts" The McCready campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but McCready spokesman Aaron Simpson told PolitiFact earlier this month that McCready would rather re-tool the Trump tax plan than repeal it. On his campaign website, McCready pledged to "fight to simplify the tax code and cut taxes more for middle-class families, not just the ultra-wealthy." The former Marine further explained this position on Facebook after the tax bill first passed, saying that he would have preferred "real tax reform" that was simpler, did not increase the deficit and was not as "slanted toward the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations." McCready repeated these complaints during an Oct. 10 debate with Republican Mark Harris and made it clear that he supports the Trump tax bill’s cuts. "I supported very much the middle class tax cuts that were part of the tax bill," he said. "But we needed to do much more of that: Give less of the tax cuts to the Warren Buffetts and Koch Brothers of the world and more to the hardworking teachers and firefighters that deserve a lot better here in North Carolina." "Saves you $1,300" or more per year Peter Vicenzi, press secretary for FreedomWorks, said the ad’s $1,300 figure came from data produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation and the pro-business Tax Foundation, two think tanks in Washington, D.C. Vicenzi said the "you" mentioned in the ad refers specifically to North Carolinians in the 9th Congressional District, so we only looked at savings estimates for that district. The Heritage Foundation said the tax cut led to average savings of $1,353 in the district in 2018. But as PolitiFact has noted, averages can be misleading for something like the Trump tax bill, which has significantly different impacts on different types of taxpayers. "Average tax cuts vary tremendously by income levels," said Lawrence Zelenak, professor of law at Duke University and an expert in tax policy. With that in mind, we decided to hone in on the Tax Foundation’s analysis, which highlighted the distributional effects of the Trump tax plan. That study showed that 9th District residents making between $50,000 and $75,000 saved $1,337, on average, from the tax cut in 2018. Citing a Money Magazine report, Vicenzi explained that FreedomWorks pulled from the $50,000 to $75,000 income bracket to reflect a "real income" of about $52,000 that the magazine calculated based on the state’s median household income of $47,830. But Zelenak said the ad’s claim that the tax cuts save "you" $1,300 is misleading, since only people with average incomes between $50,000 to $75,000 have actually experienced that amount of savings. According to the same Tax Foundation analysis, district residents earning $25,000 to $50,000 collected an average of $1,009 in savings, and those with average incomes between $10,000 and $25,000 brought in an average of $156. By contrast, those with yearly incomes higher than $200,000 saved a whopping $24,137. This disparity is not reflected in the ad’s claim. "For a voter in the $10,000 to $25,000 income range, it would be more accurate to say, ‘McCready wants to repeal tax cuts that save you $156 while saving the average high-income taxpayer in your district over $24,000,’" Zelenak said. Zelenak also noted that the ad says nothing about the tax cuts being deficit-financed, which could mean more savings now but higher costs in the future. "Deficits have to be paid for eventually, so that in the long run the tax cuts imply tax increases on ‘your’ children and grandchildren," he said. "But one doesn’t really expect a political ad to raise that point," he added. Our ruling In an ad seen on Facebook, FreedomWorks said "Dan McCready wants to repeal tax cuts that saves you $1,300" or more per year. The $1,300 figure is an accurate average for district residents earning yearly incomes between $50,000 and $75,000, but those with higher or lower incomes will likely receive substantially different tax cuts, ranging from a measly $156 to a whopping $24,000. Plus, McCready has repeatedly indicated that while he wants to make serious changes to the Trump tax plan, he does not want to get rid of the tax cuts, especially for the middle class. Overall, the ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-07832	"Texas added more jobs in 2010 than any other state."	true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/15/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-texas-added-more-jobs-2010-any/	During his State of the State address, Gov. Rick Perry countered those "painting a pretty grim picture" of Texas finances "with the good news that continues to flow from our comparatively strong economy." "Have the doomsayers forgotten that Texas added more jobs in 2010 than any other state?" he said in the Feb. 8 speech. We’ve checked other claims about Texas’ job growth, including Perry’s statement in June that Texas had added more jobs than the other states combined. We rated that True; from January 2001 to June 2010, Texas had a net gain of 853,400 jobs. Earlier, we rated another statement False: In January, Perry claimed that approximately 70 percent of jobs created in the United States in November 2007-08 were in Texas, based on data from the Texas Workforce Commission, where number-crunchers said they added the total jobs created in the 13 job-gaining states during the one-year period. But the calculation behind his statement discounted jobs created in states that had an overall job loss. We wondered if Perry accurately recapped how many jobs Texas gained in 2010. Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to a Jan. 25 federal report detailing states’ employment and unemployment during the last year. According to the report, "the largest statistically significant" net job gain was in Texas," with 230,800 jobs, ahead of Pennsylvania (65,600) and Illinois (46,300). The report says the "only statistically significant decrease in employment occurred in New Jersey," which had a net job loss of 30,700 jobs. It’s worth noting that even states that had a net-job losses likely saw some new jobs — though not enough to offset the jobs they lost. But Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, agreed that based on preliminary December data, Perry accurately recapped how many jobs Texas added last year: "We did have the largest over-the-year employment," she said, later adding that "Texas would have certainly beaten any state with a loss." She likewise pointed us to the January bureau report noted by Frazier. According to preliminary December 2010 data in the report, Texas had the largest employment increase that month, adding about 20,000 jobs, followed by South Carolina, which added some 9,000 jobs. Abbot also told us that among the states, Texas had a 2.3 percent increase in jobs in 2010. New Hampshire came in second with a 2.1 percent job increase. Finally, we wondered how well the new jobs pay. Abbot told us that while the bureau tracks average hourly earnings for most industry sectors, "the data will only give you averages across all workers in the industry, nothing about ‘new’ versus ‘old’ jobs." Regardless of how the new jobs paid, Texas added more of them — based on net job gains — in 2010 than any other state. We rate Perry’s statement True.

pomt-03376	Says "Canada has one-tenth of our population—yet it issues far more high-skilled visas (more than 150,000) yearly than we do (65,000)."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/10/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-canada-issues-more-150000-high-skill/	Republican enthusiasm for comprehensive immigration reform is in short supply on Capitol Hill, despite the arguments from many GOP strategists hoping to win more of the Hispanic vote. There’s no lack of enthusiasm from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, however. A few weeks ago he told conservative Christians that immigrants would rescue Social Security, and in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, he wrote about the vigor they would inject into the American economy. With his co-author, Clint Bolick from the Goldwater Institute, Bush made what they called the Republican case for immigration reform, based on a pro-growth policy. To bolster his point, Bush and Bolick compared America’s approach to immigrants with that of Canada’s. "Canada has one-tenth of our population—yet it issues far more high-skilled visas (more than 150,000) yearly than we do (65,000)," they wrote. Might our northern neighbor be doing something that would appeal to the GOP rank and file? We thought it would interesting to see if the data supported the numbers Bush and Bolick brought to bear. We contacted Bush’s office, and staff told us that the statement compared the 65,000 visas allowed under the H-1B program and the total number of what Canada calls economic immigrants -- people allowed into the country solely for reasons related to work. The central point was that much more than the U.S., Canada targets the kind of talent it needs to grow. The U.S. H-1B visa The U.S. program allows businesses to hire foreign workers who have theoretical or technical expertise in specialty fields. They might be scientists, engineers, computer programmers, or similar highly skilled professions. The minimum requirement is a bachelor’s degree, or its foreign equivalent. (In keeping with the idea that technical expertise is in the eye of the beholder, there’s a special provision for fashion models.) The employer applies, not the individual. Congress placed a cap of 65,000 H-1B visas per year, although another 20,000 are granted to foreign workers who have earned a master’s degree or higher at an American university. So, all told, at least 85,000 new people per year arrive in America with an H-1B visa. The actual number of these visas issued can be much higher, 135,530 in 2012, due to renewals and applications rolled over from previous years. Also, colleges, universities, and nonprofit or government research groups are exempt from the annual caps altogether. This visa provides temporary work status. It is good for three years, and while it can be extended, it generally does not allow a person to work more than six years. Canada’s skilled worker programs Canada has two separate pathways for foreigners to work in the country. One is for temporary workers; the other is for those who move to Canada permanently. The gateway for non-Canadians that most closely resembles the American H-1B visa is the Temporary Foreign Worker program. It allows eligible foreigners to work in Canada for up to four years if employers show that they are unable to find Canadians or permanent residents to fill the jobs and that the entry of these workers will not hurt the Canadian labor market. This program covers all jobs, from the unskilled to the most demanding. Within the temporary program, there is a special category for higher-skilled occupations. These are defined as managerial or based on a skill that at the very least requires several years as an apprentice, if not a bachelor’s degree or higher. According to government statistics, about 70,000 of these more highly skilled temporary workers came in 2008 and about 66,000 in 2011. The other program, the one that accepts foreigners directly into the country as permanent residents, attracted about 257,000 people in 2012. Of those, Canada classified about 160,000 as economic immigrants. Important details lie beneath these overall statistics, and we turn to those next. Comparing the U.S. and Canada Staff in Bush’s office told us that Canada’s 160,000 overall economic immigrants is the bottom line number that supports the figure used in the op-ed in comparison with the 65,000 in the American H-1B visa program. But we found several problems with matching apples to apples. For starters, H-1B is a temporary worker program; the Canadians are counting people admitted with permanent resident status. To stay for no more than six years compared to possibly the rest of your life is no small shakes. But there’s an even bigger issue with the figure of "more than 150,000" that Bush puts on the table. It greatly exaggerates the actual Canadian situation. H-1B is open only to highly-skilled workers -- that is just the workers and not their families. If we apply the same standard to Canada, then we must break down the various types of people they put under the economic immigrant umbrella. The Canadian government’s list includes caregivers, investors, entrepreneurs, and the largest one, skilled workers. Each type is listed twice; first for the principal applicant and then for that person’s spouse and dependents. Because the H-1B program only counts the worker and not his or her family, we decided to look at the Canadian figures and count only the principal applicant. When we do that, we see that the number of skilled workers last year was 38,577. The highest it reached was 48,820 in 2010. Adding in the other categories that might be considered high-skilled, such as entrepreneurs or investors, only adds a few thousand. The total remains quite a distance from 150,000. As a percentage of the nation’s population, it is much greater than the United States, but while Bush alluded to population, he did not present the figures that way. There is one type of economic immigrant that could change the total appreciably, although still leave it far short of 150,000. Canadian law allows provinces and territories to nominate their own economic immigrants. In 2012, this brought 17,177 new permanent residents to the country. We asked Michelle Parkouda to explain this part of the program. Parkouda is a senior research associate with the Conference Board of Canada, an independent group that does economic and policy analysis for businesses and the government. "Provincial nominees do vary by the needs of the province," Parkouda said. "For example, Saskatchewan is specifically targeting health professionals, farm operators, and long haul truck drivers, among others." Parkouda explained that Canada defines skilled work broadly to include the trades. For the truly higher end, there is the category of Federal Skilled Worker. These are occupations that the federal government says the country most needs and the list includes geological engineers, physical therapists, land surveyors, medical laboratory technologists and more. The provinces she said, have emphasized the skilled trades. We found no analysis of the number of provincial nominees that would qualify as highly-skilled. In short, while the grand total of economic immigrants listed in the Canadian data support the figure in the Wall Street Journal piece, that total includes many people who are family members or less skilled workers. Lastly, Canada’s population is about 34.5 million. America’s is about 314 million. To say Canada has one-tenth the population of the U.S. comes pretty close. Our ruling Bush and Bolick said that Canada issues more than 150,000 high-skilled visa a year compared to 65,000 by the U.S. That 150,000 refers not to people with visas but those granted permanent resident status, and it includes family members of skilled workers, as well as workers who are not high-skilled. The only figures we can know for sure show a level of high-skilled workers closer to 50,000, or about one-third as large as Bush and Bolick claimed. If they had meant to speak of Canada’s temporary foreign workers, a reasonable fit with the H-1B program, the high water mark for such workers in Canada was about 70,000 in 2008. That’s still about half of the number they put on the table. Combining both permanent and temporary workers would yield about 120,000 people, but they did not base their claim on that. On a relative basis, Canada does target high-skilled workers much more than the U.S., but the absolute numbers Bush and Bolick used fell wide of the mark. We rule the statement Half True. Editor's note: This report has been updated to include more details about exemptions and renewals of H-1B visas.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2013-07-10T12:22:13	2013-06-30	['Canada']
pomt-01098	State "school funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/jan/12/virginia-education-association/teachers-group-says-vas-school-funding-16-below-in/	The Virginia Education Association has its knives out for legislation before the General Assembly that might allow some of the state’s lottery proceeds to be spent on veterans. The state constitution requires that all lottery profits -- now about $540 million a year -- be piped to public schools. Del. Scott Lingamfelter, R-Prince William, has proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow an unspecified portion to be spent on job training and education for veterans. The measure would have to be passed two years in a row by legislators and then approved by voters before it would become law. The VEA, which represents about 50,000 teachers and public education professionals, says schools can’t afford to lose any funding. In a Jan. 2 blog post, the organization said state support for public schools still hasn’t recovered from cuts during the Great Recession. "School funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation," the VEA wrote. We’re not taking sides on Lingamfelter’s resolution. But we did wonder whether the VEA’s claim about about the 16 percent drop in state support for schools, when adjusted for inflation, is correct. Robley Jones, the VEA’s director of government relations and research, told us the figure came from a study released in August by the Commonwealth Institute, a liberal think tank. The institute updated its findings in November and now predicts that public education spending, when adjusted for inflation, will drop by 17 percent between the 2008-09 school year and the 2015-16 year. The calculation is largely based on data of past spending and inflation rates. The finding also assumes that the General Assembly will not adjust its education budget for this school year and that inflation rates will not markedly change through mid 2016. We did our own rough calculations, seeking to avoid assumptions about future budget levels and inflation. That meant focusing on data available from 2008 through 2014. We relied on a 10-year spread sheet on public school spending supplied by the Virginia Department of Education and an inflation calculator furnished online by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s what we found: The state paid an average of $5,245 per student during the school year that ended in June 2009. Adjusted for inflation, that would be $5,773 in 2014 dollars. The amount Virginia paid per student during the school year that ended in June 2014 was $4,832. In raw dollars, state funding per student dropped by $413 -- roughly 7.9 percent -- over the five-year period. In inflation-adjusted dollars, state funding per student fell by $941 -- roughly 16.3 percent -- over the span. Schools may recoup a small portion of its losses this budget year, which began July 1, 2014. The state is budgeted to pay an average of $4,983 per student -- a 3 percent increase over the previous school year. The national inflation rate during the final half of 2014 was nearly flat. We should finally note that the state is one of three funding sources for public education. On average in 2013, school systems received about 51 percent of their money from their locality, 41 percent from the state and 8 percent from the federal government. The state contributes higher shares to poorer localities and lower shares to wealthier ones. Data taking into account all three money sources shows an average total of $11,316 was spent per Virginia student in the 2008-09 school year and that fell to $11,257 in 2012-13, the latest year available. When adjusted for inflation, that’s an 8.6 percent drop. The VEA’s comment, however, was clearly focused on state funding levels and that’s what we’ll judge it on. Our ruling The VEA says the state’s "funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation." Data we gathered shows that Virginia’s funding per student, when adjusted for inflation, dropped by roughly 16.3 percent between the 2008-09 school and the 2013-14 year. We rate the VEA’s statement True.	None	Virginia Education Association	None	None	None	2015-01-12T12:30:00	2015-01-02	['None']
pomt-01719	"The president's come out with rules that say, 'No new coal-fired power plants.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/07/shelley-moore-capito/west-virginia-senate-candidate-says-barack-obama-b/	Voters across Appalachia are hearing one message from Republican candidates in a handful of Senate races: President Barack Obama is killing coal. In West Virginia, U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito became the latest to deploy the tactic; Capito is running against Democrat Natalie Tennant for U.S. Senate. Capito comes out swinging against new federal regulations aimed at curbing carbon emissions from fossil-fuel burning power plants in an ad released July 29. "The president's come out with rules that say 'no new coal-fired power plants,’ " Capito says. "But what he's going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants." We tackled the latter statement regarding existing facilities in a seperate fact-check and said it was False. Has the Obama administration banned new coal-fired plants, as Capito claims? EPA’s new regulations In September 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency, at the direction of Obama, released proposed rules for future power plants. Nowhere do they say, "No new coal-fired power plants" or anything similar. So taken literally, Capito’s comment is inaccurate. But let’s not stop there. What do the rules actually say? Under the proposed guidelines, coal-burning power plants would have to limit carbon emissions to 1,100 pounds per megawatt hour over a 12-operating month period. Natural gas plants, meanwhile, would have to stay below 1,000 pounds of carbon per megawatt hour. Modern natural gas plants already meet that standard, but so far even the most efficient coal plants in operation are well above the EPA’s proposed threshold. So while the rules don’t explicitly ban new coal plants, do the tough new guidelines effectively ban the fossil fuel? Capito’s campaign says it does. Obama’s "proposed rule for new coal plants sets a standard that cannot be met without the use of carbon capture and storage technology," Capito spokeswoman Amy Graham said. This technology, she added, "has not been demonstrated at a commercial coal-fired power plant anywhere in the United States." That’s all actually true. The EPA even says the "standards will minimize carbon pollution by guaranteeing reliance on advanced technologies like ... efficient coal units implementing partial carbon capture and storage." Carbon capture and storage is exactly what it sounds like. Instead of releasing carbon into the atmosphere, power plants must capture and store it. The technology has been around for a while, but on a much smaller scale and not for entire power plants. It is a costly technology. According to Dallas Burtraw, associate director of the Resources for the Future Center for Climate and Electricity Policy, an energy think tank funded by government, nonprofits and energy companies, carbon capture is estimated to cost electric companies 15 to 20 percent more in the near future. The end of new coal plants? There are some promising developments with carbon capture technology. Southern Company, an energy provider, is already in the process of building a plant with carbon capture technology in Mississippi. The plant enjoys some special perks — including federal tax credits and proximity to an oil field that will pay Southern for its captured carbon to extract more oil — that make it somewhat unique. And there have been holdups. According to a Washington Post story, Southern Company pushed back the plant’s opening date by a year and the project has experienced significant cost overruns. But so far construction is proceeding as planned. Burtraw said the high costs to get the plant up and running are not uncommon for trailblazers trying new technologies. Usually, costs decrease as competition increases and the building and manufacturing becomes more efficient and standardized. The EPA pointed us to three proposed projects in North America, including two in the United States, that will include carbon capture and storage. In truth, coal plants face a much greater threat than regulation: Natural gas. Natural gas is much cheaper and a more efficient fuel source than coal, luring energy companies away from coal at a fast pace. "Coal is getting really beat up badly in the market by cheap gas," said Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin. "Over the last few years, new power plants have been dominated by natural gas, wind and solar." Burtraw added: "There were not going to be any new coal plants built anyway. That is the real ringer here." Amy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis, added that energy demands across the country have stabilized, meaning there are few emerging markets where new plants of any kind are needed. That also dampens prospects for new coal plants. Obama’s regulations create another disadvantage for coal that, at least in the interim, makes it more expensive than natural gas. In that sense, Burtraw said, the new restrictions, in practice, "sort of lock in the current trend," but they don’t create it. Nor does that spell the end for coal entirely. The price of carbon capture technology should fall in the future as it becomes more commonplace. When it does, Burtraw said it will be a "gamechanger." Coal may have other long-term economic benefits over other resources as well. "Wind and solar have benefits, but they’re intermittent. Natural gas is subject to all sorts of price volatility, at least historically, and it’s subject to hurricanes that can cause disruption," Webber said. "So people will see coal is domestic, it has value, it’s not as volatile, it’s stable, but you just can’t burn it the way you did before." Our ruling Capito said, "The president's come out with rules that say, 'No new coal-fired power plants.' " The rules do not explicitly ban future coal plants, so already this is an exaggeration of what the EPA has proposed. While the future of coal is uncertain, it has much more to do with energy markets and the rise of natural gas — a cheaper and more efficient energy source — than Obama’s regulations. The stricter carbon standards from the EPA may create additional barriers to building new facilities. But already there is one attempt to build a facility that would meet these thresholds and experts expect it won’t be the last. The test facing coal is real, but Capito goes way too far in her indictment. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Shelley Moore Capito	None	None	None	2014-08-07T14:37:39	2014-07-29	['None']
pomt-00597	"There is not a single documented case of abuse" of the bulk metadata collection program.	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/jun/04/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-claims-no-abuse-bulk-metadata-collecti/	After weeks of political hand-wringing, the Patriot Act is out and the USA Freedom Act is in. But despite substantial support from both parties, the sweeping national security reform is not without critics. Chief among them is Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who unsuccessfully lobbied to extend bulk metadata collection authorized under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The metadata program, which allowed National Security Agency officials to collect phone data such as call length and the phone numbers involved, started in 2006 and was kept top-secret until Edward Snowden famously exposed it and other NSA information-gathering initiatives in 2013. The USA Freedom Act, meanwhile, forces the NSA to subpoena phone records from phone companies instead of collecting the data directly. Rubio argued to keep the metadata program as is in a USA Today op-ed May 10. "There is not a single documented case of abuse of this program," Rubio wrote. "Internet search providers, Internet-based email accounts, credit card companies and membership discount cards used at the grocery store all collect far more personal information on Americans than the bulk metadata program." The metadata program has not produced a single case of abuse? That’s a strong claim. Does it withstand scrutiny? Well, sort of. It depends on how you define "abuse." There are two factors at play here: the actions of the NSA officials enacting the program and the legality of the program itself. First, we’ll discuss those who oversaw the program. Did they "abuse" their power? There were certainly glitches in the program, at least. Declassified 2009 documents enumerate a list of what the NSA called "non-compliance" instances. In one case, 3,000 phone numbers were found to have been listed as approved under the "reasonable articulable suspicion" (RAS) standard without having gone through the proper regulatory channels. In another, phone numbers were automatically added to an alert list without meeting the standard. Although PolitiFact Florida was able to find dozens of such instances, none of the documented cases appeared to demonstrate willful negligence of regulations. Most were corrected almost immediately, and the vast majority involved mishandling technology. As the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) wrote in its 2014 appraisal of the metadata program: "None of these compliance issues involved significant intentional misuse of the system. Nor has the Board seen any evidence of bad faith or misconduct on the part of any government officials or agents involved with the program." "This is one time in my life when I am going to agree with Marco Rubio," said Molly Bishop Shadel, a senior fellow at the University of Virginia’s Center for National Security Law. "You've noted compliance issues, but that's not the same thing as intentional abuse." Stephen Vladeck, a professor of Law at American University, says he sees the non-compliance issues differently. "If one defines ‘abuse’ to require intentional malfeasance, then it’s a lot harder to show that the phone records program was ever ‘abused,’ " he said. "But that’s certainly not how dictionaries define that term or how I have to imagine it’s commonly understood." A quick look at Webster’s shows "abuse" to mean, "A corrupt practice or custom; improper or excessive use or treatment." We found no evidence of corruption but did find evidence of improper treatment. Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity fellow at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation, noted that the secretive way the metadata collection program was set up could have allowed for some willful abuses to go unreported. Put simply, there could be some abuses we don't know about. The second question circles around the metadata program itself. Could the bulk metadata program be seen as one big "abuse" of Section 215 of the Patriot Act? Rubio’s writes in his op-ed that, "Despite recent court rulings, this program has not been found unconstitutional, and the courts have not ordered a halt to the program. This program has been found legal and constitutional by at least 15 federal judges serving on the FISA Court on 35 occasions." These claims are true, but don’t tell the entire story. According to the Second District U.S. Court of Appeals, the metadata program was not permitted under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The U.S. government tried to argue the program was permissible under the "relevance" standard of evidence collection because even seemingly immaterial phone data could have theoretically led to relevant information or become relevant in future investigations. "We agree with appellants that such an expansive concept of ‘relevance’ is unprecedented and unwarranted," the court wrote. "The statutes to which the government points have never been interpreted to authorize anything approaching the breadth of the sweeping surveillance at issue here." The district court said it didn’t feel the need to rule on the constitutionality of the bulk metadata program because it ruled it was not legal according to the original legislation. The court allowed the program to continue only because of the future congressional debate that could "profoundly alter the legal landscape." Even the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board -- which found that the program was "operated in good faith" -- said there was no legal basis for the bulk collection of data. "Because the program is not statutorily authorized, it must be ended," the board wrote. Our ruling Marco Rubio said, "There is not a single documented case of abuse of this program." Rubio’s office did not respond to a request for comment. There are plenty of documented cases of misuse of the metadata collection program. It just depends whether that misuse is what you or Rubio have in mind when you think of abuse. We found no example of intentional misuse of the program. At the least, Rubio should have been more clear in in his op-ed to help readers understand the complexities of the metadata collection program. Rubio’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-06-04T10:00:00	2015-05-10	['None']
pomt-10712	"Gov. Romney's own health care plan in Massachusetts ... requires by law that a representative from Planned Parenthood sit on the MassHealth advisory board."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/27/fred-thompson/facts-dont-always-tell-the-truth/	Although the statement is technically correct, the facts clearly don't support the point that former Sen. Fred Thompson is trying to make about his rival, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. It is true the Massachusetts state law passed under Romney's leadership gave the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts a seat on an advisory board for MassHealth, the state's Medicaid health insurance program for the poor. But the board advises MassHealth on service costs and reimbursement rates, not policy, and the board's members represent the state's major providers of medical care, including the extended care industry, physicians, hospitals and community health centers, as well Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood is Massachusetts' largest provider of sexual and reproductive health services, with 55,000 patient visits last year at four clinics statewide, the group says. It does perform abortions, but Angus McQuilken, vice president of public affairs, says gynecological exams, birth control, treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy testing and the like make up the bulk of its services for MassHealth patients. MassHealth only pays for abortions deemed "medically necessary," or in the case of rape or incest. Thompson's campaign further charges that although Planned Parenthood got a seat on the board, antiabortion groups did not. That's true, too. But by the nature of the advisory board, there would be no reason for such groups to get a seat: Although some antiabortion groups provide pregnancy counseling and adoption services, they are not major providers of health care. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04406	Says President Obama waited two weeks to call the attack in Libya "terror."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-waited-14-days-call-libya-attack/	For weeks, Republicans have been hammering the Obama administration for allegedly concealing the true nature of the attack in Libya that claimed the life of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. During the second presidential debate, Mitt Romney charged that "it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror." Obama had bristled at the idea that his administration had played politics with the attack. He called the suggestion "offensive". Obama: "The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened -- that this was an act of terror -- and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime." Romney: "I think interesting the president just said something, which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror." Obama: "That's what I said." Romney: "You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?" Obama: "Please proceed, governor." Romney: "I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror." Obama: "Get the transcript." We went to the transcript, and the president has a point. On September 12, the day after the attack, in the Rose Garden, Obama condemned the attack and said, "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation." In the days since, some have parsed Obama's remarks and argued he didn't say the Benghazi attack was specifically an act of terror. However, given the overall context of his comments, it seems a fair conclusion that he was including the attack in the "acts of terror" that he said would never shake American resolve. However, in the days that followed, the White House spokesman and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations suggested that the attack seemed to have taken advantage of a demonstration over an American-made video that disparaged Islam. On Sept. 13, White House spokesman Jay Carney said, "The protests we're seeing around the region are in reaction to this movie. They are not directly in reaction to any policy of the United States or the government of the United States or the people of the United States." The next day, a State Department spokeswoman said, "We are very cautious about drawing any conclusions with regard to who the perpetrators were, what their motivations were, whether it was premeditated." But she ended with this: "Obviously, there are plenty of people around the region citing this disgusting video as something that has been motivating." On Sept. 16, five days after the attack, Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said, "We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned." On Sept. 20, Carney told reporters, "It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials." But that same day, Obama told an audience at a town hall meeting, "What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests." It wasn’t until Sept. 21 that everyone in the administration as a whole stated publicly that the attack was planned and executed by a terrorist group. Our ruling Romney said it took the president 14 days before he called the Libya attack terror. In fact, Obama described it in those terms the day after the attack. But in the days that followed, neither he nor all the members of his administration spoke consistently on the subject. There were many suggestions that the attack was part of demonstrations over an American-made video that disparaged Islam. We rate the statement Half True. Update: After we published this item, we heard from readers that the president called the attack "an act of terror" two more times -- on Sept. 13 in Colorado and Sept. 14 in Nevada. "As for the ones we lost last night: I want to assure you, we will bring their killers to justice," Obama said at a campaign event in Nevada. "And we want to send a message all around the world -- anybody who would do us harm: No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America." So as we noted in our original item, Romney is off the mark as it relates to the word "terror." But Obama contributed to the administration's mixed message when he spoke at the Univision Town Hall event on Sept. 20. A questioner asked: "We have reports that the White House said today that the attacks in Libya were a terrorist attack. Do you have information indicating that it was Iran, or al Qaeda was behind organizing the protests?" Here is Obama’s reply: "Well, we’re still doing an investigation, and there are going to be different circumstances in different countries. And so I don’t want to speak to something until we have all the information. What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests." So although Obama acknowledged the uncertainty, he emphasized the inflammatory video and the protest as contributing factors in the attack. By mentioning the video, Obama drew attention away from the possibility that the attack had been a planned assault. This lies at the heart of the dispute over what Obama and his administration were saying in the days after the attack. The president had the chance to be more complete and direct in Florida, but the administration was continuing to focus on the response to the video. Just four days earlier, Ambassador Rice downplayed the possibility that the attack was premeditated. The president’s words did not correct that impression. So while Obama did use the word "terror," there is also some truth to Romney's point that it took many days for the administration to fully characterize the attack as the work of a terrorist group. So we're still rating this Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-17T00:20:13	2012-10-16	['Barack_Obama', 'Libya']
pomt-10706	"The mayor said … 'if you happen to be in this country in an undocumented status . . . then we welcome you here. We want you here. We'll protect you here.' "	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/28/mitt-romney/giuliani-was-welcoming-to-immigrants/	At the CNN/YouTube debate in St. Petersburg on Nov. 28, 2007, Mitt Romney tried to use Rudy Giuliani's words to make him look soft on illegal immigration. The full quote from Romney: "The mayor said -- and I quote almost verbatim -- which is 'if you happen to be in this country in an undocumented status - and that means you're here illegally - then we welcome you here. We want you here. We'll protect you here.'" Romney is referring to a statement Giuliani made at a 1994 news conference: "If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair." Romney says that shows Giuliani is too welcoming to illegal immigrants and that his policies made New York a "sanctuary city." We've addressed the sanctuary city debate in this item and this article, so we'll simply focus here on the quote. Indeed, Romney accurately summarized what Giuliani said. The quote came from a 1994 story in the New York Times that was headlined "New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal." The article noted that Giuliani had given a "spirited defense of illegal immigrants, virtually urging them to settle in New York City." It quoted him saying, "Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are undocumented aliens. " Giuliani has not denied the comment but, in discussing immigration, has emphasized the need for more border security and tougher enforcement by the federal government. We find that Romney accurately described Giuliani's comment and find Romney's statement to be True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2007-11-28T00:00:00	2007-11-28	['None']
pomt-07333	"For four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/11/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-inaccurate-budget-debt-claims-video-/	In the runup to the May 11, 2011 announcement that he will run for president, Newt Gingrich has reminded folks about the good old days of the American economy when he was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. "For four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt," Gingrich said in a video on his campaign website. With soft music in the background, Gingrich says with a smile, "We’ve done it before. We can do it again." Gingrich was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs. PolitiFact decided to check Gingrich’s claims about the budget and debt, since he and other Republicans have criticized President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy, hoping to convince voters that the incumbent doesn't deserve a second term. First, the balanced budget. The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins October 1 and ends September 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits, of $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997. By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion. But that’s only two balanced budgets he can claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in the House. Now for Gingrich’s comments about the debt. The national debt was slightly above $4.8 trillion when Gingrich became House speaker in January 1995. By the time he left the position in January 1999, the debt was more than $5.6 trillion. That’s an increase, not a decrease. If you look just at the two years Gingrich can claim credit for where the federal government was in surplus -- fiscal years 1998 and 1999 -- the government did pay down about $200 billion in debt. But that would be cherry-picking, because over the full four years of his speakership, the debt rose by about $800 billion. Efforts to contact Gingrich’s top spokesman, Rick Tyler, were unsuccessful. To summarize, Gingrich was off on both claims concerning the budget. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it’s a stretch for him to take credit for more than two of those years. As for paying off $405 billion in debt, the data we found shows the debt actually increased during Gingrich’s four-year tenure as speaker by more than $800 billion. We rate Gingrich’s claim False.

pomt-00705	The man who killed a motorist who fatally struck a 2-year-old was "back on the street" because he had received a 13-year sentence for bank robbery but only "served two years."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/30/david-clarke-jr/killer-was-street-after-serving-2-years-13-year-ro/	Although his department’s primary activity is running two jails and patrolling freeways, not fighting crime on the streets, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. frequently speaks out nationally on policing, and often in a critical way. Most recently, he made multiple appearances on Fox News to talk about rioting in Baltimore that followed the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died of a spinal-cord injury that he suffered while in police custody. Clarke blasted Baltimore’s mayor for not responding more forcefully to the violence. Local judges are also a regular target of the sheriff. Addressing Milwaukee crime on the April 26, 2015 edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a show produced by WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Clarke called judges "the weak link" in the criminal justice system, saying violent offenders don’t spend enough time behind bars. As an example, he alluded to Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, a 27-year-old Milwaukee man who shot and killed the driver of a van that killed his 2-year-old nephew in a traffic accident. Chiles previously served time in prison for his role in a bank robbery. "When a person comes up before a judge for an armed robbery, a bank robbery -- like the guy who shot the person who hit the 2-year-old -- he got a 13-year sentence, of which he served two years, and he's put right back on the street," Clarke said. "We don’t have a law problem -- we don’t need more laws -- we need tougher sentencing." Clarke's claim suggests Chiles was sentenced to 13 years in prison but served only two. That’s not what happened. Chiles’ case Late on the afternoon of April 12, 2015, a Sunday, Chiles’ 2-year-old nephew ran into a Milwaukee street and was killed by a passing van. Moments later, Chiles emerged. He shot the driver in the head and in a spray of bullets, fatally wounded his own 15-year-old nephew. (Four days later, with police in pursuit, Chiles killed himself in a suburban Chicago hotel room.) The bank robbery occurred nearly four years earlier, on Aug. 4, 2011. Chiles, the getaway driver, was charged with being a party to the crime of robbery with threat of force. He pleaded guilty and, in January 2012, was sentenced. by Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Conen. Here is what Chiles could have faced and what he actually served for the bank robbery, in terms of time in prison and on extended supervision. The figures are based on state law and court records and were confirmed by the prosecutor who handled the bank robbery case. Total term Portion in prison Portion on supervision Maximum possible sentence 15 years 10 years 5 years Chiles’ sentence 4 years 2 years 2 years A few notes on the figures: Length of sentence: Chiles benefited from helping the district attorney’s office. The judge was told that Chiles cooperated in an unrelated homicide case that stemmed from an argument during a dice game, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The way a prosecutor put it, Chiles testified at the trial of "a more dangerous offender" and that man was convicted of first-degree reckless homicide. Time incarcerated: Chiles was credited for the time he spent in jail while his case was pending, which is common. So, of his two years behind bars, he served six months in jail and a year and a half in prison. Extended supervision: Chiles was released from prison in August 2013 and was due to remain on extended supervision until August 2015. That meant he still had about four months to serve at the time of his death. Clarke’s position As for Clarke’s claim, let’s note that when people talk about sentencing in a felony case, they usually think about the time an offender is being sent to prison. But technically, the sentence includes both time in prison plus time on extended supervision after the offender is released. Clarke’s spokeswoman, Fran McLaughlin, told us the sheriff meant to say Chiles could have gotten a 13-year sentence. But she acknowledged the total maximum sentence was actually 15 years -- 10 years in prison, plus five years of extended supervision. McLaughlin said Clarke’s point was that Chiles could have received a 15-year sentence but he served only two years in prison. But Clarke’s claim ignores the fact that Chiles would not have been given the maximum sentence, since he had been a cooperating witness in a homicide and a recommendation for a lesser sentence was part of the plea agreement. Our rating Clarke said the man who killed a motorist who fatally struck a 2-year-old was "back on the street" because he had received a 13-year sentence for bank robbery but only "served two years." Chiles’ sentence was four years, not 13. Chiles did spend two years behind bars, as Clarke indicated, but he was also sentenced to two years of extended supervision. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.	None	David A. Clarke Jr.	None	None	None	2015-04-30T11:38:15	2015-04-26	['None']
pomt-08337	"Morgan Griffith fought for a plan that would have taken money away from our schools and given it to Northern Virginia schools instead."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/28/rick-boucher/morgan-griffith-says-rick-boucher-sent-education-m/	Folks in Southwest Virginia often feel forgotten by the power brokers elsewhere in the state. The region has many of the poorest public school districts in the state and residents often feel wealthier areas of the state get a disproportionate share of government help. So heads turn when a Southwest Virginia politician is accused of taking money from local classrooms and giving it to prosperous Northern Virginia. That’s the charge U.S. Rep. Rick Boucher, a Democrat, has launched against Republican challenger Morgan Griffith in Virginia’s 9th Congressional District race. "Morgan Griffith fought for a plan that would have taken money away from our schools and given it to Northern Virginia schools instead," says a Boucher TV ad that began running this week. Did Griffith really push for a reverse Robin Hood policy that hurt his constituents? We checked the facts. The Boucher ad cites a February 18, 2010, story in the Roanoke Times. The article provided an update on the ongoing debate over changing the formula for providing state aid to public schools. The formula is based on the wealth of localities. The poorest school systems receive up to 85 percent of their education dollars from the state; the richest systems get as little as 20 percent. State law requires to formula to be calibrated every two years. For decades, the formula worked against Northern Virginia because soaring real estate prices and development boosted the region’s wealth. In contrast, the formula helped Southwest Virginia, where the tax base is small and home prices are modest. So Northern Virginia tax revenues went to Richmond and, under the education formula, much of the money went to Southwest Virginia schools. But the recession changed the balance in the 2010 calibration. Real estate prices plummeted in Northern Virginia, which sharply lowered the region’s wealth and made it qualify for an additional $134 million for schools. The additional money came at the expense of other regions of the state. Last winter, outgoing Gov. Tim Kaine made an unprecedented recommendation to skip the 2010 reset. Northern Virginia legislators were enraged and Griffith -- as well as incoming Gov. Bob McDonnell -- sided with them. Griffith pointed out that that formula has almost always helped Southwest Virginia. "If we start saying when it benefits another region of the state that we don’t like it, then in a couple of years they may do away with it and we’ll be getting the short end of the stick," he told The Roanoke Times. "It’s helped us for 30 years. It hurts us this year. But I suspect it will help us for 30 years into the future, and messing with it and playing games with it in a single year is foolish." When Griffith made the comment, the 27 school systems in the 9th Congressional District stood to lose a total of $261,000 in state funding over two years. That’s a tiny portion of the $1.25 billion sent to the district -- about 1/50th of 1 percent. Some of the lost money would have gone to Northern Virginia, but its impossible to say how much because there were a few localities outside Northern Virginia that also would gain from the recalculation. Did Griffith actually fight to reset the formula, as the Boucher ad says? When we asked Boucher’s spokesperson for proof, she referred us to the Feb. 18 story in The Roanoke Times. Although the article quotes Griffith, it makes no suggestion Griffith was leading a reset effort. We searched the archives of four other Virginia daily newspapers and couldn’t find a single story that implied Griffith was going to war on the issue. In March, the General Assembly approved a state budget that reset the school formula. It also allocated funds to cover most of the losses localities would suffer in the redistribution of money over the next two years. Schools in the 9th Congressional District will wind up losing about $65,000, some of which will go to Northern Virginia. Griffith, along with many other Southwest Virginia lawmakers, voted for the budget. Let’s go back to Boucher’s ad. The 9th District congressman says Griffith "fought for a plan to take money away from our schools and give it to Northern Virginia schools." Griffith was on record supporting the reset of the school formula, but Boucher fails to prove that Griffith "fought for" it. And contrary to the implication of the ad that the district would suffer a significant loss of education money, the amount lost from the 9th District is actually a small fraction of 1 percent. We find Boucher’s claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15349	"The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-mexican-government-forces-many-b/	In a July 8 interview with NBC, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump didn’t ease up his rhetoric about Mexican immigration -- at all. "The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country because they're smart," he told interviewer Katy Tur. "They're smarter than our leaders, and their negotiators are far better than what we have, to a degree that you wouldn’t believe. They're forcing people into our country. … And they are drug dealers and they are criminals of all kinds. We are taking Mexico’s problems." In the interview, Trump left no doubt that he believes the Mexican government is taking an active role in pushing migrants into the United States: He used the word "forcing" four times to describe what the government was doing. But is it really the government forcing Mexicans across the border, rather than individual decisions to leave, either to seek employment or to join family members in the United States? A range of immigration experts told PolitiFact that there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim. (The Mexican Embassy did not respond to our inquiries, nor did a Trump representative.) For evidence, let’s start with the Mexican Migration Project, a bi-national research effort founded in 1982 to study Mexican migration to the United States. Anthropologists, sociologists and other experts with the project gather data, including field interviews with migrants, that illuminate migration patterns. The co-director of the project is Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology and public policy at Princeton University. Based on more than three decades of field research, Massey finds Trump’s assertion to be flat wrong. He pointed to findings from a paper he published in 2014 in the journal International Migration Review. In the paper, he and his co-authors concluded that undocumented migration from Mexico "was driven largely by U.S. labor demand and by the existence of well-developed migrant networks that provided migrants with access to U.S. labor markets despite a rising enforcement effort. The taking of additional trips is likewise tied to U.S. labor demand and access to migrant networks, as well as the number of U.S. trips a migrant has accumulated over his or her career." What about Mexican government efforts to push migrants into the United States? Nonexistent, Massey told PolitiFact. "Mexico has never had a policy of pushing migrants toward the United States, much less ‘forcing many bad people into our country,’ " Massey said. "Mexican migration is tied to social and economic circumstances on both sides of the border." Other experts sided with Massey. "Immigrants come to work or to join family," said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends Project. "And no, the Mexican government doesn’t force anyone to leave." "No, the Mexican government doesn't force anyone to move here illegally, though it certainly doesn't object," added Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration. Tom Smith, a demographer at the University of Chicago, drew a contrast with one historical example in which a government did take a role in pushing certain people to emigrate to the United States -- the Mariel boatlift from Cuba in 1980. "While most immigrants were simply part of the general Cuban population of people wanting to emigrate, it appears that the Cuban government did intentionally send a disproportionate number of those they deemed to be undesirables, including prisoners and other institutionalized groups," Smith said. But there is no such evidence that the same thing has happened in Mexico, he added. About the closest support for Trump’s claim that we could find is the argument that the Mexican government’s failure to provide strong economic growth and restrain drug violence has been a factor in convincing people to leave the country and come to the United States. Still, it’s not accurate to equate the Mexican government’s inability to accomplish these goals and the idea that the government is forcing people to leave. It’s also worth noting that migration from Mexico to the United States has been declining in recent years. This is due to demographic factors more than anything else, Massey said. Trump "does not seem to have gotten the memo, but undocumented migration stopped in 2008 and has been zero or negative since -- not because the economic fundamentals have changed, but because the fertility rate dropped from 6.7 births per woman in 1970 to 2.2 births today, bringing about an aging of the population," Massey said. "People initiate migration between the ages of 18 and 30, and if they don't migrate then, they are unlikely ever to migrate." In other words, Massey said, the number of people in the age category most conducive to immigration is dropping, so immigration is dropping as well. Our ruling Trump said "the Mexican government forces many bad people into our country." Setting aside the question of whether Mexicans who have come to the United States are "bad" or not, there is no evidence of any Mexican policy that pushes people out of Mexico and into the United States. As has been the case for decades, a combination of economic and family factors accounts for most of the migration from Mexico to the United States.

pomt-07453	"Every time we've cut taxes, revenues have gone up, the economy has grown."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/19/joe-walsh/rep-joe-walsh-said-every-time-weve-cut-taxes-reven/	Members of the tea party movement like to say the "tea" stands for "taxed enough already." Several House members on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour said they stand by that sentiment, even if tax increases could more quickly balance the budget. Amanpour asked if it was realistic to oppose tax increases while also calling for a balanced budget. "Can you really sustain what everybody is calling for, just by cuts in public services? Doesn't there need to be revenue-raising mechanisms?" she asked. "Christiane, you raise revenue by growing the economy," said Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill, one of several new House members elected with tea party support. "And everything this president has done the last two years has gone against that. You get taxes and regulations off the backs of businesses so that revenues can increase." "I know that that is your position," Amanpour said. "But there's so much evidence, even going back to Ronald Reagan, where he did tax cuts and in fact the debt increased, and then he had to make tax increases. I mean, can you really cut public spending by that amount and just expect to balance the budget?" Walsh answered, "In the '80s, government revenues went up. We didn't cut spending. Revenues went up in the '80s. Every time we've cut taxes, revenues have gone up, the economy has grown." We decided to check out Walsh’s claim that "Every time we've cut taxes, revenues have gone up, the economy has grown." We should first note that on its face, Walsh’s statement is not accurate. The White House Office of Budget and Management publishes detailed tables of government collections of income taxes. There was a small dip in 1983, after President Ronald Reagan signed off on a tax cut in 1981, though tax revenues increased the next year and all through the 1980s. More significantly, income tax revenues fell in 2001, 2002 and 2003, as President George W. Bush successfully pursued tax cuts. We contacted Walsh’s office, and his staff told us that the Bush tax cuts didn’t reach their full impact until 2003 (when the top rate decreased to 35 percent, where it now stands), and that tax revenues increased after that. "The pickup in economic growth, and the strong growth in revenues, coincides fairly neatly with the 2003 tax cut," said spokesperson Elizabeth Lauton via e-mail. But the question of rising revenue is more complicated than that. For one thing, economists expect tax revenues to go up each year due to economic growth, population growth and inflation, even if tax rates stay the same. So saying "revenues have gone up" isn’t particularly meaningful in that context. Given that, it would be more significant to be able to say what effect tax changes have on the overall economy. But this isn’t easy, because so many things affect the economy more than the federal tax code. What this means is that you can raise taxes during a bad economy and get less revenue, or you can cut taxes during a time of economic growth and get more revenue. Those changes to revenue generally aren't caused by the tax rates at all, but by other changes in the broader economy. President Bill Clinton, for example, raised taxes in 1993, and the economy expanded for much of the 1990s and tax revenue went up. "There's no clear relationship between taxes and economic growth," said Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "Too many factors complicate the picture to draw clear conclusions about the taxes-growth relationship." Additionally, a 2006 report from the U.S. Treasury Department concluded the effect of most tax laws on the wider economy were "uncertain, but probably generally small." Previously, we’ve rated statements that tax increases lowered revenues, and we’ve found that False. Walsh’s statement stops short of such a claim, but it does leave the impression that tax cuts could help the budget picture, and that’s problematic. The 2006 Treasury report sought to document the revenue effects of every major tax law passed since 1940. To compare the different laws, it examined tax revenues as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, a measurement that accounts for economic growth and inflation. The report found that laws that lowered taxes produced declines in revenues, and that laws that increased taxes produced increases in tax revenues. This undermines claims that tax cuts can actually increase government revenues more than they would have increased otherwise. We’re examining Walsh’s statement, "Every time we've cut taxes, revenues have gone up, the economy has grown." He said "every time," and that’s not the case. Revenues did not go up in 2001, 2002 or 2003, after tax rates were lowered. We also find it problematic to make hard claims about tax cuts growing the economy enough to increase tax revenues and helping balance the budget. Overall, we rate Walsh’s statement False.

pomt-05565	Says Jeff Wentworth was the only Republican to vote against the Texas measure requiring women to have a sonogram before receiving an abortion.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/05/donna-campbell/donna-campbell-says-jeff-wentworth-was-sole-republ/	In an email blast, a Republican challenger to state Sen. Jeff Wentworth, whose San Antonio-rooted district takes in some Travis County residents, says: "We can’t afford to have a liberal pro-choice Republican representing us any longer." The email from Donna Campbell continues: "My opponent, Sen. Wentworth, was the only Republican to vote against the sonogram law requiring women to have a sonogram or listen to the fetal heartbeat 24 hours before receiving an abortion." The email also mentions Wentworth’s past votes against requiring parental consent for abortions for underage girls and points out a 2001 award given to Wentworth by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. For this fact check, we’re isolating the claim closest to Wentworth’s recent record, that he was the only Republican to vote against the state’s 2011 measure requiring women to have a sonogram before an abortion. We confirmed from news accounts that Wentworth was the only one of 19 Republican senators to oppose the proposal requiring a woman seeking an abortion to have a sonogram at least 24 hours before the procedure with the results made available to her. As reported by the Austin American-Statesman in a Feb. 18, 2011, news article, the Senate’s 21-10 vote for a Senate version of the sonogram measure that was then sent to the House "was largely along partisan lines, with Democratic Sens. Eddie Lucio Jr. of Brownsville, Carlos Uresti of San Antonio and Judith Zaffirini of Laredo voting for the bill and Republican Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio opposing." That story closes: "Wentworth, who represents parts of southern Travis County and all of Hays County, was the lone Republican opposing the bill. He said his office had received 356 calls against the bill and only 28 in support. ‘I am a hairy-legged male who will never be pregnant myself,’ he said. ‘I am voting for my district.’" According to Senate records, the senators who voted against preliminary and final approval of the proposal in February 2011 consisted of nine Democrats and Wentworth. Ultimately, a House version of the proposal, carried by Rep. Sid Miller, R-Stephenville, was signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry. We wondered if any House Republicans voted against that. According to record votes placed in the House Journal, Rep. Sarah Davis, R-Houston, consistently voted against it, as the House gave preliminary and final approval and later concurred with Senate amendments resulting in the version sent to Perry. According to a March 4, 2011, Houston Chronicle/San Antonio Express-News blog post, Davis said she could not support the sonogram bill in light of her commitment to working against the expanding role of government and to protecting the doctor-patient relationship from government interference. Also, according to votes recorded in the House journal, two other Republicans, Reps. Lanham Lyne of Wichita Falls and Rick Harcastle of Vernon, opposed the House’s May 5, 2011, move to concur with Senate amendments to the earlier House-approved legislation. That concurrence succeeded by 94-41. In a telephone interview, Lyne told us he couldn’t recall precisely why he voted "no" in that instance. Jessica Lynch, a legislative aide to Hardcastle, told us by email that Hardcastle could not recall why he voted no on concurrence. "However," her email says, "he wanted to point out that he is a co-author of HB 15 (the sonogram proposal) and asks that you not construe his (later) vote to indicate he did not support the measure." Hardcastle became a sponsor of the legislation in February 2011. Upshot: Wentworth was the only Republican senator to oppose the sonogram mandate and was among very few Republican legislators to do so. Wentworth, elaborating on his position, mentioned constituent calls in an op-ed article posted online by the San Antonio Express-News on Feb. 24, 2011, further writing that he viewed the measure as an unwarranted intrusion into a woman's private life. Wentworth also wrote that he personally prefers adoption to abortion. "But I cannot, nor should the government, attempt to impose my moral or religious convictions on the entire female population of Texas as a matter of state law," he wrote. "Once a woman, in concert with her family, her physician, and her clergyman has decided to terminate her pregnancy, I believe it is inappropriate and exceedingly intrusive in her private life to tell her by law what she must do in connection with that medical procedure. And I don't believe her state legislator should be on that decision-making committee." Contacted about Campbell’s claim, Wentworth pointed out Davis’s opposition in the House. He called Campbell’s statement about his being alone among Republicans "nearly right." Campbell spokesman Jon Oliver told us by email that Campbell was referring to the Senate, not the House. "It is only logical to infer that those who voluntarily sign up for Dr. Campbell's email on her website for state Senate do so with interest in that particular race. Dr. Campbell is running for the Texas Senate, and assumes her subscribers know that she is only talking about that legislative body. We wouldn't be speaking to any votes that took place in the House in any of our emails to supporters." Our ruling Wentworth was the sole Republican senator to vote against the sonogram measure. But a House Republican consistently opposed it and two others voted against going along with the final Senate-amended plan that passed into law. We rate Campbell’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-02788	It's a good sign for Obamacare that in California, "the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/05/ezekiel-emanuel/ezekiel-emanuel-says-california-kids-are-signing-h/	Health policy experts are eyeing one group of Americans very carefully as people sign up for health coverage on insurance exchanges: young adults. Participation by this age group is seen as crucial to the success of the insurance marketplaces. Young adults are generally in better health and are needed to balance out risk among other, older enrollees, and they’re disproportionately uninsured. On NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, host David Gregory asked if "the lag effect" of the struggling federal marketplace will deter young adults from signing up for insurance. Washington Post Wonkblog editor Ezra Klein said the Obama administration was planning to deploy a vast marketing campaign to encourage young people to sign up through their preferred TV shows, social networks and parents, but the effort was not fully rolled out as problems with Healthcare.gov persisted. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist and former health care adviser in the Obama administration, pointed to a microcosm of success in California, where the state-based exchange is "working well enough." "And there, the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population," Emanuel said. "And so it does appear that we are going to have enough when you look at that data point. And if we can get the word out, I think Ezra is right, we'll get enough young people." California’s enrollment figures were described as "a rare bright spot" by the New York Times amid dismal reports about the federal marketplace. We wanted to dig in a little more and find out if Emanuel is right that young adults are signing up as a proportion to the population in California. Several experts we reached were initially thrown by Emanuel’s use of "kids." Emanuel clarified he was referring to news about young adult sign-ups from Covered California, the state’s health insurance exchange, in a brief interview. (He added that he has an almost 30-year-old "kid.") Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, distributed a Nov. 21 press release that pointed out 18- to 34-year-olds applied "in direct proportion to California’s population" in October. That age group comprised about 22.5 percent, or about 6,900, of the people who selected plans during October and were not eligible for Medicaid. In 2010, the same group comprised about 21 percent of the state’s population. The last two columns from the following Covered California chart illustrate the point. The gap widens if you tinker with different data. Young adults comprise 25 percent of the state’s population using 2012 data from the American Community Survey, and about 27 percent if you take out the 65-and-over population, which is eligible for Medicare, according to the California Health Interview Survey 2011-12 data. So, we’re all finished here, right? Well, hold on. For one thing, experts said it’s way too early to draw sweeping conclusions from the state’s first month of data. November data, unavailable until mid December, could tell a very different tale. The real meaningful test will be how many young adults sign up long-term. "People talk about these numbers because we have them, but you can't extrapolate from these," said Glenn Melnick, a University of Southern California health policy professor. Then there’s another matter of Covered California, and Emanuel, spinning the data in a way that emits positivity but, experts say, is not exactly relevant. Instead of comparing the percentage of young adult enrollees to their share of the population, some said it would be better to compare those signups to young adults’ share of the uninsured population, which is about 40 percent, several experts said. "They need it proportionate to the target population, which is the uninsured," Melnick said. Another issue with comparing to a share of the population: The marketplaces established by the health care law are not really intended for the nation’s youngest and oldest residents. Children who receive coverage because of the law are getting it mainly through expanded Medicaid offerings, and adults over 65 are eligible for Medicare. That means comparisons could be misleading. "So that’s not to say that they are completely off the table, but they are by design expected to be less represented in the enrollment in Covered California than their presence in the population," said Marian Mulkey, director of the California Healthcare Foundation’s Health Reform and Public Programs Initiative. Using 2011 Current Population Survey data, the foundation determined that 41 percent of the state’s uninsured population under age 65 is between the ages of 18 and 34. Since one of the goals of the law is to get more people in this group insured, you’d want to see young adult signups go higher than just their share of the overall population, she said. "I would submit that that’s not quite a high enough bar for what they should be aiming for," she said of measuring the signups against the overall population. "I would hasten to say that this is very early data, it doesn’t mean that they won’t get there." Gail Wilensky, the director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that measuring sign-ups of young adults against the percentage of uninsured young adult Californians would be the more relevant statistic. "This might not look quite so good as the percent of the population since this group is disproportionately uninsured," Wilensky said. Still, Dylan Roby, a UCLA School of Public Health assistant professor of health services, disagreed with the idea of the uninsured population being a better benchmark. In California, he said, the risk pool for plans sold on the individual market, both within the exchange and outside of it, is the same. Plus, he said people who sign up for insurance early are likely to be those who already have it but were not previously eligible for subsidies on the exchange. "So, given that we don’t have numbers on how many 18-34 year olds are signing up for coverage outside of the exchange with the same consumer protections, deductible limits, out-of-pocket maximums, etc., I am not sure you can make any statement about the magnitude of sign-ups and response to the new plans," he said. Roby said his target would be for 35-40 percent of people signed up on the individual market (through Covered California or on their own) to be between the ages of 18 and 34 at the end of open enrollment. More than 2 million uninsured Californians are 18-34 years old. Genevieve Kenney, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, struck a similar chord, saying neither view of the percentage of young adult enrollments -- whether compared to their share of the state population or of the uninsured population -- is necessarily germane. "Neither one really tells you what we should expect to see if young adults were participating in proportion to their share of the overall target population for the exchange," she said. "That’s what feels relevant to me." Many uninsured young adults actually look like they’re eligible for Medicaid, she said. So just looking at the percentage of those who are signing up for exchange coverage against the overall uninsured population doesn’t tell the full story. She added that enrollment estimates broken down by age group are hard to come by, and "I haven’t myself tried to calculate that particular target." A Nov. 20 Reuters story that analyzed early data from state-run exchanges in Connecticut, Kentucky, Washington and Maryland said "so far more than 20 percent of the 23,500 combined enrollees in private insurance plans are 18 to 34 years old, ranging from about 19 percent in Kentucky and Connecticut to about 27 percent in Maryland." Other state-run exchanges, such as New York and Hawaii (and D.C.), have not released enrollment data by demographic. The early turnout among young adults is encouraging, said Jen Mishory, deputy director of the Young Invincibles, an advocacy group focused on enrolling young adults into coverage, in an interview. "We anticipate that we’ll see a broader surge in young people as they get more educated." Several of those states reported an uptick in enrollments in the early weeks of November, including California. Our ruling Emanuel tried to point to a good sign for the health care law in California, saying "the proportion of kids who are signing up is the proportion of kids in the population." The statement is pretty accurate for young adults for the month of October. But it is a curious statistic. Health policy experts said the stat is misleading because the entire California population is not supposed to access the marketplace. They offered more apt comparisons that relate more closely to the uninsured population and alter the figures. The more important takeaway is that it’s very early to draw significant conclusions about California’s performance and what it could mean for a functional Healthcare.gov after its first month.

pomt-10138	"Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/07/john-mccain/94-not-even-close/	As the presidential campaign heads into its final weeks, John McCain’s camp increasingly is portraying Barack Obama as a classic liberal who has never met a tax hike that he can’t support. McCain’s camp contends Obama’s addiction to taxes would further weaken the already staggering economy by placing new burdens on middle-class Americans and prompting U.S. corporations to shift more jobs overseas. This line of attack allows McCain and his proxies to point to the Arizona Republican’s lengthy record in Congress of opposing tax increases while supporting reduced federal spending. During the second presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., McCain made the charge directly. "Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That's his record." Ninety-four times? Not that we could find. The tally more accurately demonstrates how easy it is to distort a candidate’s record by characterizing in broad strokes complicated bills and resolutions that contain myriad policy proposals. The 94-vote count first appeared in a June 9 Republican National Committee “tax backgrounder” that purported to document the tax increases Obama proposed or supported in the U.S. Senate and Illinois Legislature, when he served in the state Senate. The RNC didn’t respond to a request from PolitiFact to provide a breakdown of all 94 votes it says its research staff unearthed. It indicated the results were gleaned using the Library of Congress’ legislative search engine, Thomas (named for Thomas Jefferson and found here ). With the right query, it’s possible to get that result, but the GOP’s list is misleading for a number of reasons. First, it counts votes on Democratic budget resolutions, which set nonbinding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation but don’t have the force of law. For example, the Republicans cite Obama’s votes in support of a fiscal 2009 budget resolution they say would raise taxes on individuals earning as little as $31,850. We’ve previously dealt with this claim and ruled it False . The document assumes that many of President Bush’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will be allowed to expire at the end of 2010, or that their cost will be offset by new sources of revenues. Republicans point to this as evidence that Democrats want to raise taxes. But the documents don’t have line items on tax proposals. And even if they did, they would amount to little more than political statements, because the documents cannot change tax law. So voting in favor of the resolution isn’t akin to voting to raise taxes. The budget resolutions do provide a perennial source of fodder for incendiary claims because while they’re largely symbolic, they prompt lengthy debates with numerous votes. Obama voted on 43 occasions with the majority of Democrats during various stages of debate on the 2009 budget resolution, including instances in which he helped defeat Republican proposals dealing with borrowing from the Social Security trust fund and erecting new procedural hurdles to any legislation that would raise income taxes. The 94-vote list also takes liberties characterizing which votes actually are “for higher taxes.” McCain’s folks count Obama’s opposition to extending lower tax rates for dividends and capital gains (at least nine votes), and his votes against exemptions to the Alternative Minimum Tax for middle-class taxpayers (at least five votes). These proposals were hallmarks of Republican efforts to extend a variety of popular tax breaks that were expiring when the GOP controlled Congress. Many Democrats, including Obama, opposed them as fiscally irresponsible and primarily benefitting the rich. But if voting against a tax cut is the same as voting for higher taxes, then it’s worth noting McCain’s rather well-documented record in this regard. In 2001, McCain antagonized conservatives when he voted against President Bush’s tax cuts, saying they needed to be paired up with equivalent cuts in spending. He voted against the 2003 round of cuts, too. We give McCain credit for adding the phrase "or against tax cuts" to Obama’s list of alleged misdeeds, because unlike the RNC tax backgrounder, this captures the essence of at least 20 of his documented votes. However, McCain and the RNC both fail to note that some of the other votes would not have resulted in a net tax increase, but instead redistributed the burden among different payers. The 94-vote tally, for example, cites Obama’s support of higher taxes on the oil and gas industries. But some of those Democratic tax plans that would have eliminated a tax break for domestic production or imposed a “windfall profits” tax on the biggest oil companies would have applied the proceeds to wind energy, cellulosic ethanol, geothermal power and other emerging energy sources that produce less pollution than traditional sources. They also would have created a new incentive for consumers to buy plug-in hybrid cars and extend tax breaks for energy-efficient homes and businesses. The Obama campaign says the 94-vote figure is dishonest and misleading, and with a wink compiled its own list of McCain votes, using his camp’s methodology. The results: the Republican candidate voted for higher taxes 477 times since arriving in Congress in 1982, including 105 occasions since 2005. Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden invoked the 477 figure during the vice presidential debate when Gov. Sarah Palin made the very same 94-vote charge. Biden said, “It’s a bogus standard.” We didn't track down all 477 votes the Democrats claimed, but we looked at a few and found that McCain, indeed, could be depicted as having voted to raise multiple taxes, just as Obama did, if one reads the fine print. For example, in May 2006, McCain voted for a massive fiscal 2006 tax and spending bill that, among other things, increased excise taxes on public charities and expanded the base of the tax on private foundation investment income. These revenue-raisers helped offset $70-billion in tax cuts, including reduced rates on capital gains and dividends and writeoffs for small businesses, according to a summary prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation. In 1997, McCain voted for a $100.4-billion, five-year tax cut package that, among other things, raised cigarette taxes 10 cents per pack in 2000 and 15 cents per pack in 2002. In the record, there are many instances in which Obama supported actual tax increases. We found more than 20 examples, such as an August 2007 vote on legislation to expand the State Children’s Health Insurance Program that called for increasing the federal cigarette tax by 61 cents per pack, to $1. Obama also supported a plan enacted in June to pay for a new veterans’ education benefit by levying a new 0.5 percent surtax on individuals who make more than $500,000 or couples who make more than $1-million in adjusted gross income annually. But 94 still is awfully far away. The McCain campaign could easily claim that Obama has "repeatedly" supported higher taxes according to his record in the Senate. But by using such a precise number, the McCain campaign's charge carries a greater level of authority and credibility, which it really doesn't deserve. It's not merely that their count is wrong, but that they're misleading with their attempt at unsupported precision. We say False.

pomt-11318	"Luke Messer? He plotted with the Never-Trumpers to steal the nomination from President Trump."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/13/todd-rokita/luke-messer-plot-never-trump-steal-nomination/	Three Republican candidates competing for a U.S. Senate seat to represent Indiana are trying to prove they are the closest allies to President Donald Trump, who in 2016 won Indiana by 19 percentage points. The race represents one of the GOP’s best chances to seize a Senate seat from Democrats in the midterm election. The seat is held by Democrat Joe Donnelly. In an ad released a month ahead of the Republican primary, on April 3, Senate hopeful and current U.S. Representative Todd Rokita said his opponents were faking their support for Trump. Rokita described Mike Braun as a lifelong Democrat and fellow U.S. Rep. Luke Messer as an anti-Trump conspirator. "And Luke Messer? He plotted with the Never-Trumpers to steal the nomination from President Trump," Rokita said in the ad. "You’ve got to be kidding me." We wondered whether Messer indeed plotted to steal the nomination from Trump. That’s an exaggeration. Rokita’s staff explained they were not accusing Messer of formally organizing with politicians and PACs opposed to a Trump presidency, but of pushing rhetoric harmful to Trump’s chances of clinching the Republican nomination and winning the general election. The white knight Nathan Brand, Rokita’s spokesman, produced an April 19, 2016, article from The Hill as evidence of Messer’s "plotting" prior to the Republican National Convention. The story was about an internal split in the Republican Party regarding a potential rule change to allow a "white knight" candidate to claim the nomination if none of the official candidates mustered a simple majority of delegates. Messer named Mitt Romney and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels as possible white knight candidates. "My belief is it’s all about fairness," Messer is quoted as saying. "Ultimately, the convention has to be perceived to be fair." Messer’s campaign argued the names were a response to a hypothetical situation and had no substance given that Messer was not a delegate at the convention and would thus be unable to influence its outcome. Rokita was. (Trump won all of Indiana’s delegates.) Rokita’s campaign countered that the white knight possibility was one tactic floated by the Never Trump movement, and playing ball with the hypothetical implied Messer’s approval. Robert Dion, a political science professor at the University of Evansville, Ind., downplayed the significance of a brokered convention, which has not happened since the 1950s. He saw Rokita’s attack as hyperbole. "To the degree that there was some hypothetical prospect that someone was planning to deny Donald Trump the nomination, there is nothing in this article to suggest that Rep. Messer was directly involved in advancing this idea," Dion said. Criticism of Trump Rokita’s campaign also compiled a series of clips in which Messer criticized Trump’s campaign rhetoric. In the clips, Messer said Trump did not act presidential or "like an adult" and repeatedly wondered whether Trump has "a personal tic where he can’t control what he says." "In my opinion when you look at Donald Trump's life pattern, you have not seen a life pattern of racism, but you have seen a series of comments that could fairly be called race baiting over the course of the last multiple months," Messer said in a June 9, 2016, C-SPAN interview. "I’ve spoken out against it, I think it’s wrong, and it needs to stop." Messer expressed worry that Trump’s rhetoric would cost him the election. But a closer look at the full interviews revealed that while Trump was not his first choice, he would still support Trump over Clinton. "If he will focus on jobs, focus on the record of deceit from the Clintons over their decades of public service, he can win the election," Messer said. "It is important he does. I do not want to see a President Clinton. That would be bad for America." Messer’s remarks don’t suggest plotting, Dion said. "The video links merely suggest that he was sometimes uncomfortable with the tone of some of then-candidate Trump’s remarks," Dion said. "If that is the criterion for being a Never-Trumper, then that would include an enormous segment of the American population, including Republicans. It is clear all along that he is a loyal Republican who plans to vote for Trump and who wants his party to succeed." Rokita’s campaign said Messer could have communicated these suggestions directly to the Trump campaign. By taking them to national television instead, he undermined Trump’s credibility among voters. The Messer campaign pointed to a double standard: In a February 2016 interview with WXIN TV, Rokita called Trump "vulgar, if not profane," when comparing Marco Rubio with Trump. "At some point you have to be presidential," Rokita said. "People expect that, and you see that in Marco Rubio." Like Messer, Rokita acknowledged he would support Trump if he became the nominee. Rokita did not seem particularly psyched about Trump in a May 2016 radio interview, either. He didn’t deny an interviewer’s claim that he would "obviously be anti-Trump" during the convention, called Trump’s comments on manufacturing "manipulative," and responded he wasn’t worried about the down-ballot ticket effect of a Trump supporter in the race for his current congressional seat, implying he was not the pro-Trump candidate. Tony Samuel, who was vice-chairman of the Indiana Trump campaign and has endorsed Rokita, said Rokita ultimately came through for the Trump campaign whereas Messer did not. While Messer spoke against Trump’s rhetoric on television, Samuel explained, Rokita made several media appearances at the campaign’s behest praising, for example, Trump’s debate performance. After analyzing public statements from the congressmen leading up to the Republican National Convention, FiveThirtyEight classified both as "reluctant endorsers" of Trump, third in a seven-category scale. FiveThirtyEight rated both Messer’s and Rokita’s support for the Trump agenda in the 90th percentile. Other than a few conflicting budget votes, Rokita and Messer have been virtually identical on the policy front, according to Indiana political columnist Brian Howey. Neither Trump nor Pence have endorsed either candidate. The state campaign chairman, Rex Early, endorsed Rokita, and the American Economic Freedom Alliance, a group linked to Marty Obst, senior political adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, is running pro-Messer ads. Our ruling Rokita said Messer "plotted with the Never-Trumpers to steal the nomination from President Trump." Rokita’s campaign and supporters argued that Messer’s engagement with questions about a white knight candidate and criticism of Trump’s rhetoric on national television expressed an implicit support of the anti-Trump movement. But we found no indication that Messer actively plotted to prevent Trump from winning the Republican nomination or election. He maintained reluctant support for Trump throughout the 2016 campaign. What's more, Rokita had moments where he criticized Trump in a similar manner as well. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-06929	"We jumped 11 places since beginning this year in terms of being job-friendly."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/21/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-touts-ohios-improvement-cnbc-busin/	"We're No. 23" may not sound like a stirring claim, but Gov. John Kasich has been using one version of it to lead cheers for Ohio. "We jumped 11 spaces since beginning this year in terms of being job-friendly," he said in an interview July 12, 2011, with former Fox News colleague Sean Hannity, crediting the improvement to "probably the most massive comprehensive piece of legislation passed in modern times in Ohio." He was referring to the recently passed state budget, which he signed into law June 30. He cited more accomplishments and some sources of information when he repeated the claim the next day with former House colleague Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC: "My state was dying. It is my job to get us out of this. We jumped, according to CNBC, 11 places since I've become governor as business friendly in America." And Kasich got a third chance to tout Ohio July 17, 2001, on NBC's "Meet the Press," telling host David Gregory: "Ohio was dying, and we are beginning to really become business-friendly. ... In Ohio, because we faced our $8 billion budget deficit and provide tax relief, what's happened? CNBC says we've jumped 11 points, 11 places in terms of business-friendly." PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at the claim. The governor’s office confirmed he was talking about CNBC's annual rating of "America's top states for business," which the business channel released in June. Ohio ranked 23rd. That is, in fact, an advance of 11 spots from last year’s list, which made Ohio the most improved state (followed by Florida and Pennsylvania). CNBC said its study used input from business groups including the National Association of Manufacturers and the Council on Competitiveness to rank states in 10 categories: cost of doing business; workforce; quality of life; economy; transportation and infrastructure; technology and innovation; education; business friendliness; access to capital, and cost of living. Ohio's biggest improvement came in the "cost of doing business" category, based on tax burden, including individual income and property taxes, and business taxes, particularly as they apply to new investments. Utilities, wages and rental space were also figured. That specific improvement was hailed by the Ohio Business Development Coalition, which said, "Ohio improved to 5th place from 29th place last year due to a multi-year effort to reform the state's tax structure, which took full effect in 2010." In April, the coalition noted, a report from Ernst & Young with the Council On State Taxation ranked Ohio as having the third friendliest tax environment in the nation. Those tax reforms came before Kasich's watch, however; they started two administrations ago, under Republican Gov. Bob Taft and a GOP-controlled legislature in 2005. Kasich can claim some credit in the category of economy, where the study measured each state’s fiscal health by looking at projected budget gaps or surpluses for the coming fiscal year. Ohio moved up 10 spots to 24th. We think it's fair to allow the governor some license for salesmanship, but we don't think it's splitting hairs to note that the CNBC study did not give Ohio high marks for being "job friendly" or "business friendly" as he stated. His underlying meaning is that Ohio’s business climate has improved, and his wording is similar to the name of the study, "America’s top states for business." But Ohio did not fare as well in some of the study’s 10 categories as it did overall. One category specifically graded states "on the perceived 'friendliness' of their legal and regulatory frameworks to business." Ohio ranked 42nd in it. The state was dead last in the "workforce" category. CNBC says states were rated "on the education level of their workforce, as well as the numbers of available workers. We also considered union membership. While organized labor contends that a union workforce is a quality workforce, that argument, more often than not, doesn’t resonate with business. We also looked at the relative success of each state’s worker training programs in placing their participants in jobs." CNBC's list is one of many. Chief Executive magazine annually rates the "best/worst states for business," using input on "overall business-friendliness" from 550 CEOs. Ohio this year ranked 41st -- improved two places from last year but down 19 places from 2006, making the state one of the biggest losers over five years (with Illinois, Washington, Maryland and Pennsylvania). The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation ranked Ohio 46th in its state business tax rankings for 2011. But the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, a trade group that represents small businesses and advocates for less government regulation, annually issues a rigorous "Business Tax Index" that pulls together 18 different tax measures to rank the states from best to worst in terms of the costs of their tax systems on entrepreneurship and small business. The index for 2011, published in April, ranked Ohio 9th. The SBE Council also has a "Small Business Survival Index" that evaluates states in 36 categories including corporate and income taxes, gas and diesel taxes, government spending, health care and energy costs, inheritance taxes, and workers compensation costs. The latest, released in December, rated Ohio 9th in the nation, up from 11th a year earlier. So where does that leave the governor’s claim? He was correct that Ohio jumped 11 places in a study from CNBC, although he misstated the name of the study. The state didn’t fare as well in some catagories of that study, including one that specifically looked at perceived friendliness to business. There also are several other rankings for business climate and tax burdens out there. In some of those, Ohio has shown improvement. Others, however, still have the state low in their rankings. And some of the tax changes that boosted the state were put in place by previous administrations. Kasich was trying to show progress in Ohio, selling both the state and his stewardship. In his claim, he was citing only one study. On that study his statement was accurate, but these other points help clarify the picture. On the Truth-O-Meter, that gets a rating of Mostly True.

pomt-04275	"Sheldon Whitehouse [got] a secret closed-door briefing, warning of the [2008 economic] crash."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/nov/03/peoples-majority/super-pac-peoples-majority-says-us-sen-sheldon-whi/	A lot of people were hit hard by the 2008 economic collapse and its aftermath. U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is being accused in a recent television commercial of using insider information to avoid financial losses. In the ad, Whitehouse pops up three times to utter the phrase "fighting for the people" as a female narrator says: "September 08. An economic storm brews. Within months, millions of Americans will lose jobs, homes and life savings. "In Washington," the commercial continues, "Sheldon Whitehouse gets a secret closed-door briefing warning of the crash. After that secret briefing, certain stocks he owned got sold just in time. Some people go to prison for that. That's not fighting for us." To emphasize the insider trading allegation, the ad shows an image of Martha Stewart, who served time in prison for obstructing justice and lying to the government in an insider trading case. The YouTube version of the ad, posted Oct. 25, 2012, is titled "Insider Trading." Did Whitehouse really get a secret briefing warning of the crash? First, some background. Questions about insider trading by Whitehouse and other members of Congress surfaced in November 2011 in "Throw Them All Out," a book whose author, Peter Schweizer, was featured on the CBS news program "60 Minutes" on Nov. 13, 2011. On Sept. 16, 2008, Schweizer reported, top congressional leaders were briefed by top Bush administration officials -- then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke -- about the unfolding financial crisis. In his book, Schweizer says Whitehouse was one of many members of Congress who sold holdings after the briefing. Over the next week, Whitehouse sold stock in eight companies involving a dozen trades valued between $425,000 and $950,000 (the total is uncertain because his disclosure form only gives price ranges), according to his disclosure form. The timing of the trades raised questions of insider trading. Under the law in effect at the time, members of Congress couldn't be prosecuted for engaging in such activity, which is illegal for the general public. (The insider trading law has since been amended, with Whitehouse's support, to include members of Congress.) But there’s a key problem with the ad’s central allegation that Whitehouse benefited from information he received at the briefing. Whitehouse says he wasn't at the meeting, which was only for top Congressional leaders, and he was not in the leadership in 2008. The Schweizer book offers no evidence that he was there. The ad comes from People's Majority, a super PAC whose address is a post office box in Alexandria, Va. Filings with the Federal Election Commission say it was formed to oppose Whitehouse. Its website doesn't give a location or a phone number, but it does say it was formed with "the hope of restoring a Republican majority in the United States Congress." Whitehouse is the only candidate mentioned. Federal documents have listed the treasurer as Ken McKay, a former GOP chairman in Rhode Island, chief of staff for former Gov. Donald L. Carcieri and later the chief of staff for former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele. Newer documents identify the current treasurer as Cabell Hobbs. We sent an e-mail to the only recent address we could find on the FEC documents and asked for backup. We then got a call from Dave Owen, of Owen Communications, in Salt Lake City, a consultant acting as a spokesman for People's Majority. So what evidence did People's Majority have that Whitehouse attended a secret closed-door briefing? "We don't say he attended the briefing," said Owen. "We say he gets a briefing, he gets the information from the briefing." "We were unclear on whether he denied being in the briefing," Owen said. "Frankly, if you're going to do one of these things you push the envelope and walk a line." For the record, the Sept. 16 briefing came at a time when President George W. Bush had already signed the government rescue of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie and Freddie had been placed under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, their CEOs and board of directors had been dismissed, Lehman Brothers had declared bankruptcy and the Dow Jones Industrial average had lost more than 12 percent of its value since May. On the day of the briefing, the government moved to bail out the insurance giant AIG. That week was the biggest trading week in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. In short, the financial meltdown was already underway. The ripple effects were just beginning to unfold. Whitehouse has said that the trades done from Sept. 16-22 were executed by a financial adviser who had the power to buy and sell stock without consulting him. "I virtually never have a conversation" with the adviser, he told The Providence Journal in November 2011. With all the turmoil on Wall Street at the time, "It's presumably pretty obvious that they were trying to be defensive with my account, but I can't go back and read their minds," he said. Our ruling The super PAC People's Majority said Sheldon Whitehouse got "a secret closed-door briefing warning of the crash" and used the information to sell stocks before the crash. But the organization couldn't provide evidence that Whitehouse was at any briefing where he got inside information warning that the financial meltdown, already underway, was going to get worse. A People's Majority spokesman told us, "We don't say [Whitehouse] attended the briefing" and the ad was an attempt to "push the envelope." In fact, the ad does say Whitehouse attended the briefing, not only pushing the envelope but shredding it. With no evidence to back up its inflammatory claim, the People's Majority ad is worthy of a little inflammation of its own. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-05382	"We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month. (Creating 115,000 jobs, the total from April 2012) is way, way, way off from what should happen in a normal recovery."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/07/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-500000-net-jobs-month-historicall/	With the economy struggling to recover from the last recession, the monthly job reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics have become key opportunities for both parties to spin the results to their advantage. And right on cue, the release of the most recent statistics on May 4, 2012 -- showing a gain of 115,000 jobs over the previous month -- prompted politicians and their allies to pounce. Shortly after the numbers for April 2012 were released, Mitt Romney went on Fox News to offer commentary. He told Fox & Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson, "We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month. This is way, way, way off from what should happen in a normal recovery." We decided to look at two parts of this comment. Is creating 500,000 jobs in a recovery "normal"? And are the job creation figures under President Barack Obama "way, way, way off from" whatever the normal amount is? We’ll take these two issues in order. (The Romney campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) Is 500,000 jobs created per month normal for a recovery? The short answer is "no." We arrived at this conclusion by looking at the net monthly change in jobs all the way back to 1970. Since Romney was referring to total jobs, rather than private-sector jobs only, we used total jobs as our measurement. And since Romney was talking about job creation patterns during a recovery, we looked only at job creation figures for non-recessionary periods, as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Finally, we excluded the current recovery. The totals below refer to the percentage of months that produced job creation totals in the given ranges over the 386 non-recessionary months since 1970: 500,000 jobs or more per month: 1 percent of months 400,000 to 499,999 jobs per month: 5 percent of months 300,000 to 399,999 jobs per month: 17 percent of months 200,000 to 299,999 jobs per month: 29 percent of months 100,000 to 199,999 jobs per month: 23 percent of months 0 to 99,999 jobs per month: 15 percent of months Negative jobs created in a month: 10 percent of months Given these statistics, we think it’s hardly "normal" during a recovery to create 500,000 jobs in a month -- it only happened 1 percent of the time. Nor for that matter is it "normal" to produce 400,000 jobs or 300,000 jobs in a month -- the median is somewhere in the low 200,000 range. So on this point, Romney is wrong. However, we also decided to run a set of numbers adjusted for the size of the labor force. Due to population growth and changing patterns of employment, the labor force has almost doubled since 1970. For this calculation, we looked at how common it was to reach a lower job-creation threshold that approximated what 500,000 jobs would be today. Here’s what we came up with. 300,000 jobs or more per month in the 1970s: 35 percent of months 400,000 jobs or more per month in the 1980s: 6 percent of months 400,000 jobs or more per month in the 1990s: 5 percent of months 500,000 jobs or more per month between 2000 and 2007: Level never reached So, even during the decade with the most robust job growth, the 1970s, it was not "normal" to reach a threshold that’s analogous to today’s 500,000 jobs created per month -- it happened about one-third of the time. And in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, it was even less common -- the likelihood of reaching an analogous threshold was never higher than 6 percent. All told, then, Romney is exaggerating "normal" job creation for a recovery. Is job creation under Obama "way, way, way off" from the normal amount? It depends on what you consider the "normal" amount. Let’s first compare Obama’s record to what happened in all recoveries between 1970 and 2007. During the 34 non-recessionary months on Obama’s watch, the median monthly change in jobs has been 110,000, which is approximately half of what it was between 1970 and 2007. And even if you adjust for the severity of the last recession by starting the count in January 2010 -- a year after Obama took office -- the median job increase becomes 120,000. That’s not much of an improvement. As we‘ve already noted, the median job increase in previous recoveries is in the low 200,000s. But Obama’s median job increase is 110,000. So Romney is correct when he notes that job growth is not matching the pace of previous recoveries during the past four decades. But by another comparison, Obama does better. If you compare Obama’s record to that of his most immediate predecessor -- President George W. Bush -- Obama’s median monthly job growth exceeded Bush’s, which was 95,000. How good do the job-creation numbers need to be? Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, said the economy needs roughly 90,000 to 100,000 new jobs every month to keep up with the growth in the working age population. "If job growth exceeds that threshold, we’re making progress toward bringing employment up to the full-employment level," Burtless said. (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Burtless said that if you set a target unemployment rate of 4.5 percent (the current rate is 8.1 percent) and aim for a similar labor participation rate to the pre-recession level of 2007, "it would be truly excellent – though improbable – if we could add 500,000 jobs a month. But adding 200,000 a month would probably satisfy the electorate, and adding 300,000 a month is not out of the question." Our ruling Romney has a point that job creation under Obama has fallen well short of historical medians, at least going back to 1970. But job creation under Obama has exceeded the levels achieved during the George W. Bush administration. And Romney’s claim that 500,000 jobs a month is "normal" is way off. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-05-07T15:48:27	2012-05-04	['None']
pomt-14050	Old City in Philadelphia "used to have more than a dozen clubs and that's what we were known for and now we’re down to two."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/25/job-itkzkowitz/has-old-city-land-1000-snookis-mellowed-out/	Old City has had a party reputation the last few years. Bars dominate 2nd and 3rd streets between Market and Chestnut. Philly Mag memorably christened it the land of 1,000 Snookis in a 2010 article. But according to the inaugural "State of Old City" report released earlier this month by the neighborhood organization Old City District, the Snookis have moved out and the Sheldon Coopers have moved in. Old City is now inhabited by a booming young, college-educated population and a cluster of tech and marketing businesses. In an interview about the findings with the Philadelphia Business Journal, Old City District executive director Job Itzkowitz expounded on the good news by comparing current Old City to the old party-filled days. "We used to have more than a dozen clubs and that’s what we were known for," he said, "and now we’re down to two." It sure seems like Old City has a nightlife scene that can get a little… douchey? … on Friday and Saturday nights. And if you’re out there, it sure seems like there’s more than two clubs around. We decided to see whether Old City has changed as much as Itzkowitz claims. Let’s start by talking about the definition of a club. Itzkowitz said he was referring to what he termed nuisance establishments, crazy bars with sketchy promoters who brought in disorderly crowds that spilled onto the sidewalks and streets. "Go back and look at the bars in the 2010 (Philly Mag) article and see how many of them still exist," he said. That article mentioned 32 Degrees, Heat, Grey Social Lounge, Cebu, Dreemz, Moda, Blurr, Triada, Bleu Martini and Red Sky as troublesome bars. Only Bleu Martini remains. Barry Gutin, owner of Old City’s Cuba Libre, used to own 32 Degrees. He said club ownership "can be done well or done poorly." His definition of a club is a place that is open late at night and have no food or only a small menu to satisfy PLCB requirements. Cuba Libre, for instance, would not fit the bill. Neither would other popular Old City establishments like National Mechanics and Plough and the Stars. The only places that mostly meet that definition are Recess Lounge, Brasil’s Nightclub, B Side Hookah Lounge and Infusion. Bleu Martini actually has a full menu of entrees like filet mignon, sea bass and surf ‘n’ turf. "If you’re asking are there fewer clubs now and fewer problems now, the answer is yes," Gutin said. "There were a lot of places trying to make money and lowering their standards for clientele to try and survive." In a regulatory sense, the PLCB separates restaurants from clubs by type of license. Almost all of Old City’s numerous bars have restaurant licenses. The lone place with an active club license in the neighborhood is Recess Lounge. HughE Dillon, Philly celebrity watcher, said Old City used to be "an out of control, rumble in the street kinda late night area," but has lately been pleased with what he regards as a safer late night scene. "Now," he said, "people just seem to rush to get in line at Big Ass Slices 218 Market Street, when the bars let out." Our Ruling Old City District executive director Job Itkowitz claimed the number of Old City clubs had declined from more than a dozen to two. We found at least 10 clubby establishments that have closed in the last several years, and going by different interpretations of "club" Old City has somewhere between one and four clubs. We rule the statement Mostly True.	None	Job Itzkowitz	None	None	None	2016-05-25T08:49:24	2016-05-11	['Philadelphia']
pomt-04154	Says Virginia is the biggest state that does not have a major league sports team.	true	/virginia/statements/2012/dec/26/jimmy-barrett/barrett-says-virginia-most-populous-state-without-/	Virginia, the mother of presidents, is barren of a major league sports team to call its own. Gov. Bob McDonnell didn’t make the prospects any better on Dec. 7 when he denied Virginia Beach’s request for state money to help build a $380 million arena and possibly lure a major league team -- perhaps the Sacramento Kings of the NBA -- to the city. A day earlier, McDonnell told Jimmy Barrett, host of the monthly "Ask the Governor" show on WRVA-AM 1140, that Virginia Beach’s $150 million request would need to be economically justifiable to be included in the state budget. Barrett seemed enthusiastic about a major league team coming to the Old Dominion. "There is no major league sports franchise in Virginia," Barrett said. "Virginia is the biggest state in the country that does not have a professional sports franchise." We wondered if Virginia really is the biggest of the non-big leaguers. We tried to contact Barrett, but didn’t get a response. It seems reasonable to assume that Barrett was comparing states by population. So we looked at 2010 U.S. Census data and found that Virginia, with more than 8 million people, ranked 12th. We counted teams from Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Hockey League, and the National Basketball Association,. All the states larger than Virginia -- California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina and New Jersey -- have major-league professional sports teams. When we added Major League Soccer and the Women’s National Basketball Association, nothing changed. There is caveat about Virginia, as Barrett acknowledged on the air. "Now you might be able to make an argument that the Washington Redskins are equally Virginia," he said. McDonnell replied, "Well, the corporate headquarters are here (in Ashburn), so we’re claiming them." "The headquarters are here," Barrett said. "Training camp is going to be here in Richmond --" "Right -- Richmond," McDonnell said. "The stadium is in Landover, Maryland, and the team is named after Washington," Barrett said. Although the Redskins are popular in Virginia, they have never had a home stadium in Virginia. Since moving from Boston in 1937, they have played in Washington or Maryland. The Washington Capitals of the NHL have their executive offices in Arlington. But they, too, have always had their home arena in Washington or Maryland. After Virginia, the next-largest state that lacks a major league franchise is Alabama, which is 23rd in population. Alabama has 4.8 million people, which is 60 percent of Virginia’s population. The other states in between that have franchises are Washington, Massachusetts, Indiana, Arizona, Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Colorado. We asked experts why Virginia lacks a major team. Chad McEvoy, a professor at Syracuse University’s David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics, said Virginia has several metropolitan areas -- Richmond and Norfolk -- that would be a good size for a NBA or NHL team. Franchises also look for a base of large corporations to become sponsors and for ready arenas or stadiums. For example, Oklahoma City built an arena and had a group of committed businessmen who bought the Seattle Supersonics and moved the team to their city. Meanwhile, Louisville, Ky., and Kansas City, Mo., have built arenas but have not lured teams yet. "Arenas can cost $300 million and new stadiums for baseball or football franchises can cost $700 to $800 million or more -- that’s a very significant initial capital cost," McEvoy said. "There is no guarantee that if you build an arena, that it will attract a team, so it can be a pretty risky proposition." But arenas are what big league franchises covet, said Joe Favorito, an instructor in advanced sports marketing and communications at Columbia University, said. "Private corporations can’t afford the infrastructure and there are grants and loan programs that a privately-funded facility could not take advantage of," he said. Franchises must also consider sports saturation, Favorito said. Washington, Baltimore, Charlotte, N.C., and Raleigh, N.C., have major league teams. And the region also has plenty of college teams. Our ruling Sure, the Redskins have their headquarters in Virginia. But there’s no major league team that plays its home games in the Virginia or in any way bears its name. We rate Barrett’s claim True.	None	Jimmy Barrett	None	None	None	2012-12-26T06:00:00	2012-12-06	['None']
pomt-04060	"The last time Republicans held hostage a resolution to ensure that our country’s bills were paid cost us more than $1 billion in added interest and slowed the economic recovery."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/jan/25/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-republicans-cost-country-more-1/	U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett disputes the notion that a partial government shutdown might be needed to make President Barack Obama negotiate spending cuts and long-term changes affecting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The Austin Democrat, reacting to U.S. Sen. John Cornyn’s Jan. 3, 2012, Houston Chronicle commentary, agreed that fiscal sanity matters but, Doggett wrote on Facebook, "that sanity can hardly be realized by jeopardizing the full faith and credit of the United States." His punch line: "The last time Republicans held hostage a resolution to ensure that our country’s bills were paid cost us more than $1 billion in added interest and slowed the economic recovery." Republicans such as Cornyn slammed the country so? By email, Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us Doggett was referring to resistance by Republicans in 2011 to raising the debt ceiling. At the time, Dohl said, the Republicans "threatened not to raise the country’s borrowing limit unless lawmakers reduced the deficit." That year, Republicans in Congress and the Obama administration unsuccessfully hunted a long-term agreement reducing the debt and budget deficits. Congress raised the debt ceiling in August, enabling the government to pay its obligations, after the Treasury had said action was needed by mid-May. In August 2011, we rated as Half True a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that record debt and Obama’s "refusal to control spending led to our nation's credit rating being downgraded for the first time in history." The nation’s debt level was a major factor for rating agencies downgrading the country’s ratings. But federal spending also had increased under President George W. Bush. Perry’s claim also overlooked the prime factor cited for Standard & Poor's downgrade--political divisiveness sapping confidence the nation would soon reach consensus on the debt issue. Later that year, Congress established a schedule for across-the-board budget cuts or "sequestration," though in December 2012, Congress put off such results a few months amid speculation there would be fresh pushes for alternative approaches. It’s not unusual for members of one party or the other to oppose a hike in the debt ceiling. Still, the Treasury says, Congress has acted 78 times to permanently raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit–49 times under Republican presidents and 29 times under Democratic presidents. Congress had so much trouble passing increases in the debt ceiling in the late 1980s, according to a news article in the Austin American-Statesman on July 31, 2012, that the House adopted a rule allowing the ceiling to be raised without a vote. "That rule was in effect for years," the story says. "The problem is always harder when government is divided between the two parties." So it was that after the 2010 elections, Republicans newly controlled the U.S. House while Democrats maintained a Senate majority. And did the 2011 events impose the costs declared by Doggett? We broke his claim into two parts--the proclaimed interest costs and the impact on the economic recovery--before turning to whether one party should be blamed. Interest costs Dohl said the 2011 delay forced the government to pay additional borrowing costs, according to a July 23, 2012, report from the Government Accountability Office, the audit and investigative arm of Congress. That report says: "Delays in raising the debt limit can create uncertainty in the Treasury market and lead to higher Treasury borrowing costs. GAO estimated that delays in raising the debt limit in 2011 led to an increase in Treasury’s borrowing costs of about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011," which ran through September 2011. The agency reached that estimate by comparing interest rates on private securities to rates for those issued by the government from January 2011, when the Treasury initially warned of the need to raise the ceiling, to August 2011, when the ceiling was raised. The "debt limit event led to a premium on Treasury securities with maturities of 2 years or more," the report says, "while Treasury securities with shorter maturities either experienced no change or became slightly less costly relative to private securities." Beyond the $1.3 billion in identified costs, the report says, are "multi-year effects on increased costs for Treasury securities that will remain outstanding after fiscal year 2011." Dohl pointed out that the Bipartisan Policy Center, which seeks to develop bipartisan consensus on government policy, applied GAO’s research to conclude that the additional borrowing costs would total $18.9 billion over 10 years. We queried Washington observers about the report. Daniel J. Mitchell of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute said by email that the GAO identified an unimpressive "ripple (not even a tempest, when you compare to overall debt numbers) in the teacup." The total federal debt, $16.4 trillion as of Jan. 22, 2013, went from $14 trillion to $14.6 trillion as Congress tussled over debt and deficit issues in 2011. Some suggested the GAO analysis was simplistic, ignoring other factors behind borrowing costs. The report itself acknowledges its researchers could not capture every possible economic and financial factor. Economic impact And did the delayed decision slow the economic recovery? Dohl, of Doggett’s office, pointed out a July 8, 2011, CNN news report stating the economy had gained a disappointing 18,000 jobs the previous month. CNN also said: "The main culprit economists are point(ing) to: uncertainty. Businesses are hesitant to hire given uncertainty surrounding federal spending cuts and tax policy, as Congress still has yet to reach an agreement on the debt ceiling and long-term measures for trimming the nation's deficit," its report said. But, the report said, other factors could have affected the job numbers. "There isn't a single silver bullet--there are a number of factors coming together," John Silvia, chief economist for Wells Fargo, told CNN. "The tsunami, floods, higher gas prices, and the stalemate in Washington all create a lot of uncertainty." New York University economist Lawrence White told us by email: "That we have a soft economy that has taken too long to recover is a well-accepted fact. But the reasons are far more complex than the debt-ceiling crisis of August 2011." Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, sounded a similar note, saying the main story in the economy over that period was the ending of federal stimulus aid approved in 2009. "If the debt standoff added to this, it is hard to see through what channel," Baker said. "There was no noticeable fall-off in either consumer spending or investment demand." Who done it? Finally, were Republicans to blame? To our inquiry, Dohl noted a July 14, 2011, National Public Radio news report saying that as many as half of House Republicans were resistant to raising the ceiling. The report quoted several Republican members dismissive of White House pressure to raise the ceiling by early August 2011, though it also said that GOP leaders wanted the ceiling raised. The report featured House Speaker John Boehner telling Fox News: "Missing August 2 could spook the market and you could have a real catastrophe. Nobody wants that to happen." The GAO report singles out neither party for blame, focusing on Treasury actions. By telephone, Tom McCool of the agency’s Center for Economics said the agency never would single out a party. "We’re not assigning blame to anybody for what happened," McCool said. Our observers divided over whether it’s fair to peg Republicans alone for the delayed action. ‘We have these conflicts," Mitchell said, "because there are different visions of what to do. To (the) extent these different visions cause a clash on matters such as the debt limit, any potential fallout is, by definition, the fault of both. My main point is that it is ridiculous to give either party more than 50 (percent) of the blame. It takes two to tango in these fights." White said deciding who’s to blame is an eye-of-the-beholder action. Baker, though, cautioned against assigning equal blame. His point: "It is new to use the debt ceiling as a tool to extract major budget concessions," he emailed. "The Dems had used it to score a few political points as I recall in 2007 (probably in the '80s as well) but they never came anywhere close to a default, nor did they get budgetary changes. It is really only the Republicans who have used it for this purpose. That doesn't make it wrong," he added. "It's just not a game that both parties have played equally." According to a Washington Post news account published Aug. 1, 2011, the House vote stemming the debt-ceiling standoff drew the support of more than two thirds of House Republicans as Democrats—some angry that Obama had retreated from a demand for higher taxes—divided on the plan, which was described as cutting at least $2.1 trillion from projected borrowing over a decade. Our ruling Doggett said "the last time Republicans held hostage a resolution to ensure that our country’s bills were paid cost us more than $1 billion in added interest and slowed the economic recovery." The government took on more than $1.3 billion in added interest during the delay period, the GAO estimates. However, it’s not clear the delay slowed the economic recovery. And while it seems to us that Republican desires for spending cuts greatly explain the delayed action, it’s also correct that GOP leaders wanted the ceiling raised while some House Democrats voted against the measure raising the ceiling. We rate Doggett’s claim as Half True.	None	Lloyd Doggett	None	None	None	2013-01-25T10:00:00	2013-01-07	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-04578	Says Romney tax plan "could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages and college tuition."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/24/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-could-take-away-middle-class-tax/	President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are in a battle for the trust of the middle class. The group might be hard to define, but most Americans say they are part of it, and many swing voters fall into it. Accordingly, both camps roll out the term frequently in their campaign ads. The Obama campaign has a new ad called "Pay the bills." It features a woman named Christie who describes a very ordinary life: Christie: "I do the laundry. I pay the bills. I make sure my kids are fed and rested and healthy." Announcer: "Moms like Christie would be stretched even more under Mitt Romney. To fund his tax cuts for millionaires, Romney could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages and college tuition." Christie: "Mitt Romney? He’s so focused on big business, and tax cuts for the wealthy. It seems like his answers to middle-class America is just ‘tough luck.’" Democrats have been attacking Romney’s tax plan since the summer. It was a favored target during the Democratic convention. The claim in this new ad is more specific than some others we’ve looked at. Here, we’ll examine the premise that Romney’s plan could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages and college tuition. To begin with, we’ll note that "could" is a very open-ended word. Many things "could" happen but that doesn’t mean they are likely to. The ad’s focus on some theoretical possibility should be contrasted against Romney’s promise that he will not raise taxes on the middle class or touch their tax deductions. This came up when Romney was asked about a study that challenged his proposals. "They made an assumption that I would reduce the home mortgage-interest deduction," Romney said in an interview with Fortune. "I will not do that for middle-income taxpayers." Romney specifically said he would "preserve tax preferences for middle-income taxpayers such as homeownership, charitable giving and health care." Romney’s problem is that he has set many goals for his plan, and they tend to conflict with each other. It is difficult, for example, to cut rates, keep tax collections the same, and keep the tax burden the same across all income groups. Briefly put, Romney would lower tax rates across the board and make up the difference by taxing income that isn’t taxed today. This is called broadening the tax base, and the biggest pots of money there are found in the deductions for home mortgages, charitable donations, state and local taxes and employer-paid health insurance benefits. Romney has said he would change the rules on tax deductions on higher income households, but he hasn’t provided enough details for any analyst to specifically predict the consequences of his ideas. The challenge of tinkering with deductions The Obama campaign backs up its claim by citing the work of the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. The collaboration includes analysts with past ties to both political parties. The Tax Policy Center reported that in order for Romney to keep some of his main revenue and tax rate goals, he would need to eat into the tax deductions enjoyed by some middle-class households. Does it follow that Romney’s plan would "take away" those deductions? William Gale, one of the report’s authors, said one should interpret the study more carefully. "It is accurate to say that it is not inconsistent with our study to say that those items could be on the block for at least some middle-income earners," Gale said. "But that’s a lot of wiggle room." In other words, the ad speaks with more certainty and in more sweeping terms than did the underlying study the campaign cites. Gale’s study did not say that all middle-class households would be affected; it found that those making more money would be. In addition, it did not say the outcome was inevitable. Rather, it found that middle-class taxes would go up if Romney stuck to every other goal in his plan. However, if he was flexible on one of the goals, then the middle class could go untouched. On the other hand, a study cited by Romney in support of his plan found that the numbers worked when deductions were reduced for households making $100,000 and up. Romney himself has said that would include people who he would characterize as middle class. Another Tax Policy Center report cited by the campaign cast doubt on a core premise of Romney’s plan. The report did not assess Romney's plan directly but noted that reducing the most widely used deductions might not produce the revenues needed to offset the ones lost through rate cuts. It also cautioned that many scenarios would raise effective rates on middle-income earners, while giving a tax break to people making more. However, it said the numbers could work if lawmakers in both parties were willing to make enough compromises on what they will and will not tax. "It is possible to maintain revenues in the face of large marginal tax rate cuts by paring back tax expenditures, but it would be very difficult," the report said. "And the task becomes much harder if another objective is to maintain the progressivity of the federal income tax." The report authors acknowledge that there is a huge gap between playing with the theoretical possibilities and dealing with political realities. Tax code politics The home mortgage deduction "is a very popular provision," said Stephen Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group focused on government waste and subsidies to the private sector. Ellis said deductions for child care and college tuition enjoy similar broad support. "President Obama’s campaign ad ignores the context in which those tax breaks would be ‘taken away’," Ellis said. "They are only going to be significantly reduced or eliminated in the context of fundamental tax reform that reduces the tax rates for the same filers." Matt Jensen, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, has written in defense of the feasibility of Romney’s plan. He said the Obama ad gets ahead of the process that would take place on Capitol Hill. "I do not believe Romney would do things that he has explicitly said he would not do," Jensen said. "More likely, he (or Congress, really) would tinker with other aspects of the tax reform plan." Romney, Jensen said, would bring certain principles to the tax plan he brings to Congress. The details of how those principles play out cannot be judged today. We should note that through his running mate, Paul Ryan, Romney has associated himself with a budget plan that would eliminate the American Opportunity tax credit for college tuition. This is not specifically part of the Romney tax plan but it would hit the pocketbooks of some 3 million households, some of whom would be in the middle class. The credit is worth as much as $2,500 for each college student. Tuition tax deductions, in contrast to the more valuable tax credits, are also in the tax code. Parents can reduce their taxable income by up to $4,000. Our ruling The Obama campaign ad says Romney’s tax plan "could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages and college tuition." Romney has said he would not reduce the mortgage deduction and has promised not to increase taxes on the middle class. However, he has failed to provide enough details for analysts to model what his plan would actually do. There are reasonable concerns that the numbers in Romney’s plan don’t add up. The ad assumes that to get the numbers right, the worst possible outcomes for the middle class are likely. It says some major deductions could be taken away. At PolitiFact, we put the burden of proof on the person speaking to back up his or her claim with evidence. The Obama ad is very specific about which deductions might be at risk. The Romney plan might be unrealistic and intentionally vague, but the Obama campaign is filling in the blanks with specific deductions that would appeal to middle-class moms. Romney hasn't said he intends to take away those deductions. And he's specifically said he won't touch the largest of those deductions, the mortgage deduction for the middle class.

pomt-03630	Says a state bill checks the spending habits of the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors by "bringing it in line with other county boards around the state."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/05/joe-sanfelippo/sanfelippo-says-bill-puts-milwaukee-county-board-s/	The former member of the Milwaukee County Board pushing state legislation to force his ex-colleagues into part-time status frequently compares the board’s $6.5 million budget -- unfavorably -- to those in four other Wisconsin counties. "You may hear supervisors tell you they need all that money because Milwaukee County is a special case as the largest county in the state," said state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo (R-West Allis) when he appeared April 10, 2013 before an Assembly committee. "Size alone ought not be the sole factor justifying the expense of a government unit." Sanfelippo laid out his math: "Consider, for example, that while the county board in Milwaukee has 38 staff members and spends $6.5 million annually on itself to serve 947,000 residents, county boards in Dane, Waukesha, Racine and Kenosha counties operate with just 10 total staff members and spend a combined $2.8 million on themselves." His final pitch: "To most reasonable observers, there is something amiss that demands repair. (The state bill) ends the board’s uninhibited spending by capping their budget and bringing it in line with other county boards around the state." The budget numbers on those four counties are easy to find, but we have not seen an analysis of his claim that the bill would bring Milwaukee County "in line with other county boards around the state." With the issue headed for a vote in May, this is a good time to check this. The claim we are looking at is about more than the numbers. It asserts the county is currently out of line and the bill would change that. When asked for backup, Sanfelippo said he was measuring the current per-capita spending of the Milwaukee board against that of boards in the next two most-populous counties (Dane and Waukesha) and two relatively urban counties nearby (Racine and Kenosha). We ran those numbers and found Milwaukee County’s board has more than double the per-capita price tag of Waukesha, more than triple that of Dane and Racine and more than four times that of Kenosha. The state bill would reduce Milwaukee County’s board budget by about 67 percent, putting its per-capita price tag between Waukesha and the other three counties cited by Sanfelippo. So Sanfelippo’s sample of four yields numbers that support his claim -- at least as far as they go. But his claim focused on counties "around the state." He used population as his standard, so what about other large counties? Brown, Outagamie and Winnebago Counties all have higher populations than Kenosha, the smallest on Sanfelippo’s list. If the bill became law, Outagamie’s per-capita board spending would be about 50 percent higher than Milwaukee County’s, we found. Brown and Winnebago would be very near Milwaukee County’s number. Washington County -- 10th-largest behind neighboring Milwaukee -- would be about 20 percent higher than Milwaukee, as would Marathon County. Rock County, by contrast, would still be spending at less than half Milwaukee County’s number per capita. It’s worth noting, too, that Waukesha County from Sanfelippo’s list would be spending about 30 percent more per capita than Milwaukee County on its county board. The bottom line By 2016, when all of the budget limits would finally kick in, Milwaukee County would fall roughly in the middle, and almost exactly at the average of the next 10 highest counties. In fact, Milwaukee County’s per-capita figure would almost exactly equal the average of the next 10 counties by population. That’s if spending holds steady in those counties until 2016. By a different measure -- County Board spending as a share of total county spending -- the story is a bit different. Milwaukee County is the highest by that measure compared to the next 10 most-populous counties, but Waukesha County is a very close second. Under the bill, Milwaukee County would fall near the bottom of the pack compared to the 10 next-populous counties. That’s "in line" and then some. All these comparisons are rough, in part because we don’t know what the comparison counties will be spending on their boards come 2016. Even Sanfelippo concedes that finding an appropriate comparison to Milwaukee County is very difficult. And we heard another concern from Craig S. Maher, a former University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh professor who served on a panel studying Milwaukee County finances. Maher told us that while Milwaukee County’s board spending was higher, the differences among counties are "on the margins." Some numbers back that up. For example, Milwaukee County’s current board expenditures represent only about 0.49 percent of the county’s total spending. In Waukesha County -- which is untouched by the state bill -- the figure is very close to that, 0.43, as we noted above. Other big counties range from 0.1 to 0.31. "This isn’t a fiscal debate," Maher said. "It’s a power debate." Maher, now at Northern Illinois University, was referring to the bill’s underlying goal of restoring or increasing the power of the county executive at the expense of the county board in Milwaukee County. Our rating Sanfelippo said his bill checks the spending habits of the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors by "bringing it in line with other county boards around the state." Milwaukee County’s board spending is significantly higher than most other large counties now, and it would fall to middle of the pack or lower under the bill depending on the measure. His comparison ultimately may shed limited light, but Sanfelippo’s claim is on target, with the cautions we noted. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-08132	Under the DREAM Act, after two years of higher education or military service "you are eligible for citizenship. Once a citizen, this paves the way to bring the rest of (your) extended family to the United States."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/dec/08/ted-poe/ted-poe-says-under-dream-act-after-undocumented-re/	Criticizing an immigration proposal that would allow undocumented residents brought to the United States as minors to qualify for citizenship, U.S. Rep. Ted Poe of Texas says illegal immigrants are "breaking the bank." In a Poe opinion piece posted Dec. 2 on Newsmax.com, the Republican from Humble questions why Congress would pass a law "that discriminates against Americans and lawful immigrants to the benefit of those who break our laws?" "After you complete two years of post high school education or two years of military service you are eligible for citizenship," he writes. "Once a citizen, this paves the way to bring the rest of their extended family to the United States." We wondered if Poe correctly summarized the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act. Poe did not initially respond to our inquiries. To start, we read the latest version of the act, Senate Bill 3992, which was introduced Nov. 30 by Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois. According to the legislation, undocumented residents become eligible for its benefits if they're younger than 30, have been brought to the United States at age 15 or younger and have lived here for at least five years prior to the measure becoming law. Also, such a resident must spend 10 years in the United States as a "conditional non-immigrant," during which he or she must complete two years of higher education or serve in the military. One year before the 10-year period is up, "conditional non-immigrants" may apply to become a permanent resident. Even then, it's not bad-a-bing, citizenship. Applicants must be of "good moral character," have not committed a felony, haven't persecuted someone based on their race, religion or nationality, engaged in voter or marriage fraud and submit to a background check and physical exam, among other hurdles. After three more years, the permanent resident is eligible to become a naturalized citizen. Barbara Hines, a law professor who specializes in immigration at the University of Texas at Austin, told us: "It is a 13 year process to citizenship, far longer than for any other immigrant group... there is way too much disinformation out there." Next, we wondered: Could these new citizens then bring their "extended" family to the United States, as Poe says? That depends on how you define extended family. By some definitions, it extends beyond the nuclear family (parents and their children) to grandparents, grandchildren, aunts and uncles, as well as spouses who are not blood kin. The U.S. State Department says on its website that U.S. citizens can sponsor immediate family members — a spouse, unmarried children or adopted children under 21 — to enter the country with an "immediate relative immigrant visa." Citizens 21 and older can sponsor their parents as well. A citizen can also enable older children, their spouses and children, and siblings, their spouses and minor children to relocate here, though a limited number of "family preference immigrant visas" are available for such relatives, according to the website. When the number of applicants for that visa exceeds the number available, applicants get bumped to a waiting list. Citizens cannot sponsor grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins or in-laws to get visas. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, a group that is generally pro-immigration, said: "The lines for sponsoring extended relatives, particularly from countries such as Mexico and the Philippines, can be very long, with waits of years and sometimes more than two decades." Hines echoed that sentiment. "For a sibling, for example, from Mexico, that wait is at least 12 years or more because the visas for that category move very slowly." As we were wrapping up this article, we made a final run at getting Poe's perspective. DeeAnn Thigpen, a Poe spokeswoman, told us that Poe was summarizing "several versions of the bill" — there are various versions floating around Congress. When we relayed our research to her, specifically about the number of family members that U.S. citizens cannot sponsor to come here, she said: "That's still a large amount of family that you're able to bring." Upshot: Two years in a higher-ed institution or the military is key to achieving citizenship under the DREAM Act, as Poe says. But he skips over many other stipulations that an undocumented resident must satisfy before becoming a citizen. The proposed process would not be rapid, nor would the outcome be assured. After achieving citizenship, a formerly undocumented resident could sponsor some family members to move here—parents, children, grandchildren, spouses, siblings, nieces and nephews (if they're minors). But that doesn't mean they could bring in all the rest of their extended family, contrary to the statement. Left out: Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws. We rate Poe's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02832	"If you survey, most (North Carolina) Democrats also agree with our (election) laws and voter ID."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/pat-mccrory/nc-gov-pat-mccrory-says-most-democrats-his-state-a/	One of the most contentious battles over voting rights in 2013 took place in North Carolina, where a Republican governor and legislature enacted a bill to overhaul the way the state holds elections. Among other things, the measure -- passed with strong Republican support and broad Democratic opposition -- required voters to show a government-issued ID at the polls, shortened the early voting period, ended same-day voter registration, and ended provisional ballots for voters who go to the wrong precinct. The bill, signed on Aug. 12, 2013, helped spark protests at the state capitol known as "Moral Mondays." The critics argued that the law curtailed voting rights to address a rare problem -- voter fraud -- and that minority voters, who disproportionately vote Democratic, could be particularly hard hit. After the law was enacted, the Obama administration’s Justice Department filed a lawsuit to challenge the law. On the Nov. 20, 2013, edition of MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown, host Chuck Todd asked Gov. Pat McCrory why he signed the law. McCrory made the argument that the bill was widely supported. "I think it's more about politics there than anything else," he said. Todd responded, "There's no politics on your side? This is not political at all? You don't see any political benefit for the Republican in these more restrictive laws?" McCrory replied, "No. Actually, if you survey, most Democrats also agree with our laws and voter ID." We wondered: Is it true that a majority of Democrats agreed with the law McCrory signed, and with the concept of showing voter identification at the polls? We found several polls that address these questions. Voter ID In 2011, the newly installed Republican majority in the North Carolina Legislature passed a voter ID law, but it was vetoed by then-Gov. Bev Perdue, a Democrat. In January 2011, Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm that uses automated telephone polling, found that 56 percent of North Carolina Democrats supported a law to "show a government-issued photo ID in order to vote," while 36 percent opposed one. This result supports McCrory’s position, and it was echoed by subsequent live-caller polls conducted by Elon University. In February 2013, an Elon poll found that 52 percent of Democrats supported a law "requiring voters to show some sort of government approved photo identification before they are allowed to vote," while 43 percent opposed it. Other polls backed up this pattern as well. A September 2012 automated-dial poll by SurveyUSA found 56 percent of Democrats supporting a photo ID requirement to vote, and an April 2013 poll by the same firm found 59 percent support among Democrats for showing a government-issued photo ID "such as a driver's license or passport." But that had changed by the time Elon asked the question in September 2013 -- nine months after McCrory became the state’s first Republican governor since 1993 and one month after he signed the law. Asked whether they supported or opposed the recently passed law "requiring voters to show some sort of government-approved photo identification before they are allowed to vote," 42 percent of Democrats said they supported it, compared to 54 percent who opposed it. Kenneth E. Fernandez, director of the Elon poll, said he doubts this is a random blip. Elon’s November poll -- which was not released at the time McCrory made his statement -- showed Democratic opposition to voter ID had risen further in the succeeding two months, with 62 percent of Democrats now opposed. "Prior to September 2013, a majority of Democrats supported the voter ID law, but that is no longer the case," he said. "My guess is that the Moral Monday protests and the national media attention has changed many Democrats’ minds." Data from another pollster actually detected skepticism among Democrats even before September 2013. In May 2013, the Civitas Institute, a conservative think tank, found that 58 percent agreed with the statement that "being required to present photo ID disenfranchises poor voters and minorities, and may even violate their constitutional rights to vote." Only 39 percent said they agreed that a voter ID law "is a common-sense safeguard against in-person voter fraud." Democrats were narrowly opposed to voter ID as early as February 2013, when Civitas found that a plurality of Democrats opposed voter ID -- 48 percent supported it, while 49 percent opposed it. The law as a whole In the meantime, we only found one poll that offered partisan breakdowns for a question about the law as a whole. That was an August 2013 survey by Public Policy Polling. Respondents were asked, "Do you support or oppose the bill the legislature passed that shortened early voting by a week, eliminated same-day voter registration, required a photo ID to vote, eliminated straight-party-ticket voting, and allowed voters to be challenged by any registered voter of the county in which they vote rather than just their precinct?" Among Democrats, 16 percent said they supported the bill, while 72 percent said they opposed it. In fact, it’s been other parts of the law beyond voter ID that Democrats have most forcefully opposed. Two polls -- by Public Policy Polling in April 2013 and Elon in September 2013 -- found Democrats rejecting early voting changes by 3-to-1 margins. And Public Policy Polling asked in March 2013 about another part of the law -- ending the option of voting for a straight-party ticket. On that question, 70 percent of Democrats said straight-ticket voting should be allowed and just 17 percent said it should be eliminated. It’s worth noting that McCrory has objected to the opponents’ characterizing these changes merely as being reductions in days of early voting without also noting that the total number of hours is to remain the same. (It's the same number of hours, but stretched over fewer days.) Neither poll added language about the hours remaining the same. After we showed McCrory’s office the data, deputy communications director Ryan Tronovitch stood by the governor’s claim, saying that much of the previous polling aligns with his claim. "If you want to take Governor McCrory to task over a few percentage points or what poll he was referencing in a two- or three-minute interview, fine, but at the end of the day most North Carolinians support this common-sense law and support showing an ID to vote," he said. "Even the most recent polling you cite (the September Elon poll) shows a high rate of support for the legislation," including 94 percent among Republicans, 74 percent among Independents and 70 percent among North Carolinians overall. A note about margins of error Polls are subject to sampling error -- the possibility that the views of the population sampled in the poll diverge from that of the population as a whole. These are expressed as "plus or minus" a certain number of percentage points. For polls with large numbers of respondents, the margins of error are usually around three to four points. This means that if a poll has a 3-point margin of error and 51 percent of those surveyed agreed with a particular question, then it’s almost certain that the actual percentage is between 48 percent and 54 percent. The polls cited here have a larger margin of error, because the number of Democrats sampled is smaller than the number of respondents in the entire poll, and that leaves more room for uncertainty. We asked the polling directors and they said the margin of error in these polls for Democrats alone tended to be between 6 and 7 percentage points. This means that most of the voter ID polls mentioned here -- those with differences between "support" and "oppose" of smaller than 12 to 14 percentage points -- have a higher degree of uncertainty. However, this high margin of error cuts both ways for the purposes of our fact check. Democrats can’t claim with certainty that Democratic sentiment now runs against voter ID, but neither can McCrory claim with certainty that most support the policy. Our ruling McCrory said, "If you survey, most (North Carolina) Democrats also agree with our (election) laws and voter ID." There’s a bunch of polling data on this question; some of it is conflicted, and much of it with a degree of uncertainty due to small sample sizes in the polls. Still, there’s enough data to cast at least some doubt on the accuracy of McCrory’s statement. While a majority of North Carolina Democrats were indeed comfortable with a voter ID law for many months, that support turned to disapproval beginning no later than September 2013 (according to the Elon poll) and possibly as early as February 2013 (according to the Civitas poll). And the one poll question that asked about the law as a whole found strong opposition among Democrats, to a degree that is well outside the margin of error. We give more weight to the recent polls that were public knowledge when he made his statement, so we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-13305	Says Will Hurd said a border-long U.S.-Mexico wall "absolutely makes sense."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/oct/07/pete-gallego/pete-gallego-mostly-wrong-will-hurd-absolutely-sup/	"We’re going to build a wall," Donald Trump says at the start of a TV ad from Democratic congressional nominee Pete Gallego of Alpine brought to our attention by Zach Hunter of the National Republican Congressional Committee. The commercial, launched as Gallego strives to retake the U.S. House seat he lost to Republican Will Hurd of Helotes in 2014, highlight's the Republican presidential nominee's repeated call for a border-length wall with Mexico. Midway, though, the focus shifts to Hurd who, a female narrator intones, "shares the same bad ideas" as Trump. Next, you see Hurd, talking on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, saying: "A wall absolutely makes sense." Text under the snippet says: "Rep. Hurd Talks Trump’s Idea to Build A Wall." Hold on there. Far as we can tell, Hurd has stopped far short of saluting Trump’s championed border-long wall. In a March 2016 interview with the San Antonio Express-News, Hurd said: "Building a wall is the most expensive, least effective way to do border security." When we asked Gallego’s campaign for factual backup of the idea that Hurd is aboard with Trump on a border-long wall, campaign spokeswoman Lyndsey Rodriguez initially declared by email that Gallego "never said that Rep. Hurd backs Trump’s border wall." Rather, she wrote, "our ad states that they share many of the same bad ideas." By phone, Rodriguez later said: "What we are saying in the ad is they both support some form of the wall." Rodriguez also provided a web link to a video excerpt from the MSNBC interview in which Hurd talked about a wall. The 10-second excerpt shows Joe Scarborough, a host of the Morning Joe show, saying: "Why do they all resort to that?" "Well, you need a wall in some places, all right," Hurd replied. "In heavily populated places, a wall absolutely makes sense." We took our own look at the full Sept. 8, 2015 Morning Joe interview of Hurd, which was pointed out to us by Hunter. Headlined "Texas congressman refutes Trump’s wall idea," MSNBC's five-minute video shows Hurd endorsing a border wall in heavily populated places. But he otherwise was clear about a border-long wall not making sense--meaning Gallego’s ad misrepresented Hurd’s declared view. Our transcript below begins with Scarborough asking Hurd about how much of the border with Mexico is in the 23rd Congressional District he represents: SCARBOROUGH: "I want to start with Donald Trump’s wall. So (addressing Hurd) you have, what, 800 miles--" HURD: "Over 800 miles--" SCARBOROUGH: "--bordering Mexico." HURD: "Right." SCARBOROUGH: "So tell me what you think when you hear Donald Trump and other people talking about building a giant wall." HURD: "You can’t build a wall from sea to shining sea, it just doesn’t work. It’s the most expensive way to do border security and it’s the least effective." A moment later, Hurd said: "What we need to do is we need to allow the men and women in Border Patrol to adjust their tactics, techniques and procedures as they see fit. You can’t have a one-size-fits-all solution in San Diego. It’s not going to necessarily work in Tucson and you need something different in El Paso." SCARBOROUGH: "Right, so why is it, though, that Republican candidates always--remember, John McCain turned to the cameras and said, ‘Build the dang wall.’ Why do they all resort to that?" HURD: "Well, you need a wall in some places, all right. In heavily populated places, a wall absolutely makes sense. A wall is just one more tool in your toolkit in order to solve the problem." Hurd went on to stress his support for closer collaboration with "some of our Mexican partners on the other side." Hurd also said the U.S. needs to make countering the drug cartels and human smuggling efforts a national priority. Our ruling In an ad, Gallego accuses Will Hurd of declaring that a border-long U.S.-Mexico wall "absolutely makes sense." In fact, Hurd has twice spurned Trump’s idea. Still, he told MSNBC a wall makes sense in heavily populated places. We rate Gallego’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-11085	"Trump approval rating better than Obama and Reagan at same point in their presidencies."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/18/gateway-pundit/headline-says-trump-tied-obama-same-point-presiden/	A story on Facebook celebrates President Donald Trump’s approval rating and boasts that it is better than two of his predecessors, Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan. "Trump approval rating better than Obama and Reagan at same point in their presidencies," said a June 9 headline on The Gateway Pundit, a pro-Trump website. The story said that Trump’s approval rating is at 45 percent, which it claims is nearly equal to Obama and Reagan at the same point of their presidences. Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. Is it true? We looked at the polls cited in the story as well as additional polls to provide a more complete picture. We found that The Gateway Pundit cited the early June polls that were the most favorable to Trump: a Fox News poll showed that 45 percent of respondents approved of Trump while Rasmussen Reports showed 47 percent approval for Trump. A compilation of polls by Real Clear Politics in early June showed that five other polls, including Gallup, all had slightly less favorable results for Trump. For Obama, The Gateway Pundit cited a Rasmussen poll that showed Obama’s approval was at 46 percent on June 9, 2010. Some experts have raised questions about Rasmussen’s polls, because they are based on likely voters, which is a smaller sample than most other polls; historically, Rasmussen has tended to report more favorable results for Republicans generally and Trump in particular. So we looked at one other poll from the same time, Gallup, and also found Obama had the same approval rating. We also found the comparison between Trump, Obama and Reagan in a story about a poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. The story said that Trump’s approval was 44 percent in early June, matching the results for Reagan (in June 1982) and Obama (in June 2010) "before both presidents saw their parties lose a significant number of House seats in the midterms." Historically, the president’s party usually gets shellacked during the midterms. The Gateway Pundit did not cite this NBC/WSJ poll, which has some warning signs for Republicans in general, including that Democrats were far more enthusiastic than Republicans about the upcoming midterms. Also, 48 percent of voters indicate they’re more likely to support a congressional candidate who promises to provide a check on President Trump, compared with 23 percent who say they’re less likely to support such a candidate. Karlyn Bowman, a polling specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, cautioned against drawing conclusions about what the polls in early June mean for the midterm election in November. "Although polls have more predictive value as we get closer to Election Day, we are still more than 100 days out," she said. Steven Smith, a Washington University political scientist, said that there is considerable variation in presidential job approval ratings across survey organizations. These differences are due to variation in sampling frames, question wordings, weighting, and other factors. "Consequently, claims like the Gateway Pundit claim that depend on differences of a few percentage points using different survey organizations’ findings are questionable. The comparisons simply are not reliable," he said. Our ruling The Gateway Pundit said, "Trump approval rating better than Obama and Reagan at same point in their presidencies." The story cited a Fox News poll in early June that found Trump’s approval rating at 45 percent and a Rasmussen poll showing Obama was at 46 percent at the same point in his presidency. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that Trump’s approval was 44 percent in early June, matching the results for Reagan (in June 1982) and Obama (in June 2010). These poll results show that Trump, Obama and Reagan had similar polling results for early June in the second year of their presidencies. These results are a snapshot in time, and other polling results show warning signs for Republicans headed into the midterms. That said, the numbers cited are correct. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01337	"U.S. troops are getting only 4 hours of Ebola training before deployment to Liberia."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/23/allen-west/do-us-troops-get-just-4-hours-ebola-training/	American personnel have just begun to arrive in West Africa in significant numbers and already, critics of President Barack Obama have raised questions about how the administration is handling the operation. A month ago, Obama announced plans to send up to 4,000 service members to help contain the deadly outbreak of Ebola. So far, about 600 are in the region, most of them in the Liberian capital of Monrovia and the rest at a staging area in Senegal. Former U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., decried the poor preparation these people received before they left. "Un-frigging-believable," West tweeted. "U.S. troops are getting only 4 hours of Ebola training before deployment to Liberia." West expanded on his disbelief in a blog post and cited as his source a Daily Beast article that had a similar headline (sans "frigging"). In West’s blog post, he dismissed assurances from military officials that soldiers would not be in contact with anyone who is ill with the disease. "We are taking incredible chances with the lives of our men and women," West wrote. "You cannot mitigate all the risks of Ebola — certainly not with just four hours of training preparation." We contacted the Defense Department to learn more about the training. What the Pentagon said tells us West might have wanted to read more than one article. The training for everyone is more extensive than he said. In addition, servicemen with greater risk of exposure get more training than those posted to locations where no Ebola exists. Army spokesman Matthew Bourke told PunditFact that on top of the standard pre-deployment training, the Army took these soldiers through a total of three other sessions. One focused specifically on Ebola, a second dealt with medical threats in general, and the third made sure they knew how to use and take off any protective clothing they might use. "The briefing on just Ebola itself, that small piece, may have in fact been roughly four hours," Bourke said. "But it was just a small piece of the greater training." The press office for U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), the central coordinating body for the military’s Ebola deployment, pointed us to a memo that lays out four levels of training. Service members who move among the general population train with protective suits. There is a higher level of training for those who work in any center that treats patients with Ebola, and another level of training for those who work in Ebola testing labs. Charles Prichard, AFRICOM spokesman, said there is no prescribed time for each level of training. However, Bourke said depending on the size of the group, it can take four hours to explain and take time to practice the right way to put on, decontaminate and remove a gown, boot covers and mask. So let’s add this up. We have four hours of Ebola training. Then about four hours practicing with protective clothing. Then another unspecified amount of time to learn about medical threats in general. Every service member gets this amount of training, or more if their posting requires it. West undercounts the training time by more than half. In an interview on Fox News, West seemed to acknowledge his mistake. The interviewer suggested that the total training took three days. West took this to mean that a public outcry had forced the military to boost its training program. The timeline doesn’t back that up. West posted his blog Oct. 20. The article he relied on was written Oct. 16. The Defense Department memo on training is dated Oct. 10. The policy was in place well before the public read about it. The mission In that Fox News interview, West cast the entire operation in a military light. He spoke of sending troops "into the hot zone of a deadly disease." This might suggest they will come face to face with Ebola. Bourke said that for the soldiers who got the training West had in mind, that is not accurate. "Soldiers are not deploying to treat Ebola patients," Bourke said. "They will be training Liberian health care providers. They will be building Ebola Treatment Units. And they will be providing logistics support." A team from the 101st Airborne Division recently deployed to Senegal and Liberia to manage the arrival of all the materials and manpower needed to build a 25-bed hospital and 17 100-bed "treatment" units. The military is deploying engineers, comptrollers and quartermasters. Some military medical staff will train local health care workers. Very few medical staff will come into close proximity with the virus. They are lab workers who will test samples of bodily fluids for the Ebola virus. The Pentagon discussed this with reporters and estimated it would involve about 25 people over the coming months. Each of them are specialists in this kind of work. Our ruling West said the United States is sending military personnel to confront Ebola after just four hours of training. While the average service member sent to West Africa will receive that amount of training specific to Ebola, the Army said that is a small part of the total training to attune them to medical hazards and to practice the measures to minimize the risk of exposure. That training applies to those who are unlikely to be exposed to the virus at all. Those who have a higher risk of exposure receive additional training. The claim has an element of truth but leaves out significant information. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2014-10-23T14:20:58	2014-10-20	['United_States', 'Liberia']
pomt-14431	"When the auto industry was going under, car parts companies like" Johnson Controls "begged taxpayers for a bailout, and they got one."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/09/hillary-clinton/wisconsin-firm-moving-overseas-begged-taxpayers-ba/	Hillary Clinton stood outside of Johnson Controls Inc. when she cut a TV spot that attacks the suburban Milwaukee-based global firm. "This is Johnson Controls," Clinton says in the ad, which was posted to YouTube on Feb. 21, 2016. "When the auto industry was going under, car parts companies like them begged taxpayers for a bailout and they got one." Did the company beg for a bailout -- and get one? Yes. And no. Prior attack Clinton’s claim in the ad, which was aired in the Duluth TV market ahead of the March 1, 2016 presidential caucuses in Minnesota, might sound familiar. A couple weeks earlier, at a debate in New Hampshire with her rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the former secretary of state said: "We bailed out" Johnson Controls Inc. when "we saved the auto industry" and "now they want to avoid paying taxes." The world's leading maker of car batteries, and a manufacturer of heating and cooling equipment and controls, was not a direct recipient of the federal bailouts of the auto industry. But Johnson Controls did push for the funds. And as Clinton indicated, the company has said it will save $150 million per year in taxes by moving its headquarters to Ireland. So we gave Clinton a Mostly True for her claim in the debate. But her claim in the TV ad isn’t as much on target. In 2008, of course, the entire auto industry was in very bad shape as the recession took hold. Layoffs at auto plants and among auto parts suppliers were on track to reach 250,000 workers. General Motors was virtually out of cash to pay its bills and Chrysler was not far behind. That December, President George W. Bush used $17.6 billion in TARP money to keep GM and Chrysler afloat. And in 2009, President Barack Obama continued the rescue of the two automakers that was financed with about $80 billion in taxpayer money, about $70 billion of which was repaid. But Johnson Controls was in much better condition. It certainly would've taken a major financial hit had the automakers gone under. But it did not directly receive any bailout funds. (The bailout money went to General Motors Corp., Chrysler LLC and auto lending arms Ally Financial Inc. and Chrysler Financial.) Our rating In a TV ad, Clinton said: "When the auto industry was going under, car parts companies like" Johnson Controls "begged taxpayers for a bailout, and they got one." The company did push Congress to approve the 2008-’09 federal bailout of the auto makers. But it did not itself get a bailout. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.

pomt-08561	Says "$30 million gap" in stadium funding forced the Portland Beavers to leave.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/29/sam-adams/says-30-million-gap-stadium-funding-forced-portlan/	To hear Mayor Sam Adams explain it, the Portland Beavers this month played their last game in Portland because city leaders couldn’t plug a "$30 million gap" toward the cost of building a new stadium for the minor league baseball team. Adams repeated that "$30 million gap" claim, or cited finances, eight times during a heated 15-minute radio exchange with The Oregonian’s sports columnist John Canzano on Sept. 7, 2010. Adams said city leaders did everything they could to keep the Portland Beavers in town, but a lack of money, not political effort, caused the team’s pending departure. "Well, some of us have to exist in the real world of finance," Adams told Canzano. "And the fact of the matter is, is that baseball, the Beavers, great, great tradition. That’s why I’m absolutely interested in keeping them in the city of Portland. That’s why we looked at 20 sites. That’s why we spent 18 months, almost two years doing that. But the fact of the matter is, there’s a $30 million gap. And there’s no amount of rhetoric on your part that’s going to make up for that gap." We decided to dust off Adams’ year-old funding proposals for the Portland Beavers. And the fact of the matter is, the gap never did reach $30 million, although it came close. But Adams’ financial assertion glossed over the more significant political pressures that dogged proposals for a baseball stadium at the Rose Quarter or Lents Park. It was those political pressures -- not money -- that derailed plans to build at the two most-viable sites. First, a review of the numbers: The Portland City Council voted 3-2 in March 2009 to support a preliminary deal to turn PGE Park into a soccer-specific facility for the Portland Timbers and to build a new stadium for the Beavers in the Rose Quarter. The proposal outlined estimated costs and funding sources. There was, in fact, a sizable gap: $26.8 million that city leaders and Merritt Paulson, the Beavers and Timbers owner, had to fill. Roy Kaufmann, Adams’ spokesman, said the mayor rounded up when citing the $30 million gap. We’ll give him that. The city later floated a plan to build a baseball stadium at Lents Park. That proposal also included estimated costs and funding sources, much of it largely tied to a controversial plan to dip into urban renewal money. That proposal included a $9 million funding gap, and Paulson -- not the city -- was required to find the missing money. In this case, Adams’ "$30 million gap" is significantly inflated. As for the politics: The Rose Quarter proposal fell apart amid public push-back over tearing down Memorial Coliseum to make way for a baseball stadium. The City Council was scheduled to vote on the issue in April 2009, but Adams postponed action twice amid criticism from the architecture community, which wanted to preserve the glass-framed building. Adams in May 2009 announced Memorial Coliseum would be spared. City officials and Paulson then focused attention on Lents Park in Southeast Portland. Vocal Lents residents who disliked the proposal booed Paulson during a hostile June 2009 meeting. The next day, Paulson withdrew his proposal citing "a lack of community support." Fast-forward to September 2010, when the Portland Beavers played their final game in PGE Park. Paulson is expected to sell the baseball team, and new ownership will likely move it to California. Kaufmann said Adams would have addressed the location and political challenges -- and not kept repeating the "$30 million gap" claim -- had Adams and Canzano had a reasoned discussion instead of their rancorous back-and-forth. So here’s the umpire’s call: Adams is correct in citing a funding gap, but he overstated it by between $3.2 million and $21 million, depending on the location -- Memorial Coliseum or Lents Park. Adams at the same time largely ignored the political challenges that ultimately killed both proposals. This historical revisionism makes Adams look like a fiscal steward, when in fact Adams and City Commissioner Randy Leonard were working most closely with Paulson to broker deals that the public wouldn’t endorse.

pomt-01946	"There’s $30 billion in expansion funds that we’ve paid – it’s our money and Nathan Deal wants Washington to keep it."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/24/jason-carter/more-context-needed-medicaid-claim/	The slugfest that is the Georgia governor’s race keeps coming back to the federal health insurance program for the poor. At issue: The refusal by Gov. Nathan Deal, the Republican seeking re-election, to expand the Medicaid health insurance program under the Affordable Care Act. Deal says the price is too steep. Expansion, he says, would cost the state $2.5 billion over the next decade. His Democratic opponent, state Sen. Jason Carter, talks up a different set of numbers and supports extending Medicaid coverage to about 650,000 low-income Georgians now without health insurance. "There’s $30 billion in expansion funds that we’ve paid – it’s our money and Nathan Deal wants Washington to keep it," Carter said recently. That’s billions with a B. As Mama used to say, that’s a lot of chicken feed. And chicken feed is good grist for the Truth-O-Meter mill. First, let’s get this shocker in print: Deal and Carter agree on something! The numbers they both cite to bolster their positions come from a 2012 study released by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The study focused specifically on the ACA’s Medicaid expansion plan, which calls for the federal government to pay 100 percent of the costs for newly eligible enrollees in 2015 and 2016 and no less than 90 percent thereafter. Expansion would bring nearly $34 billion of new federal dollars to Georgia over a decade, according to the study. Georgia’s share of the expansion during that time would be $2.5 billion. So far, so good. Except Carter said that $30 billion is what Georgians have "paid" to the federal government. That’s a very different calculation than what the federal government would send here. Finding out how much we send to the feds, and how much of that might be part of Medicaid, involves a lot more billions and a bit more math. Luckily, which is not often said about the Internal Revenue Service, some federal data can tell us how much corporate and individual income taxes come from Georgia: $74.3 billion in fiscal 2013. That’s about 3 percent of the federal revenue total of $2.855 trillion. The easiest way to estimate how much Georgians are paying for Medicaid expansion would be to take 3 percent of that total, said William Custer, director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University. The same Kaiser report Carter and Deal used estimates that expansion will cost about $800 billion in the next 10 years. So over a decade, Georgians are projected to pay about $24 billion to the federal government for that Medicaid expansion – but are missing out on $34 billion here. "It’s not that we’re paying all this money and not getting anything for it," Custer said. "We are paying for it, and we’re not getting money back. (Carter’s) basic point is right: dollar for dollar, Georgia would be a winner in Medicaid expansion." In sum, even political opponents cite the same study on how Georgia will fare under the Medicaid expansion piece of the ACA. Based on that study, Carter would be right to say Georgia is missing out on $34 billion of federal money by not expanding the insurance program. Deal claims that by taking the money, the state would incur more costs down the road. Carter gets in his own way to suggest Georgia will pay that much in taxes for the program elsewhere. The missing context is that it’s not a dollar-for-dollar trade when it comes to taxes vs. services. Carter makes a good overall point -- Georgia is set to miss out on big bucks for Medicaid. But a lot of context is required to fully understand what is going on here. We rate Carter’s statement Half True.	None	Jason Carter	None	None	None	2014-06-24T00:00:00	2014-06-09	['Nathan_Deal']
pomt-11302	"A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis," including recreational and medical marijuana.	true	/california/statements/2018/apr/19/john-chiang/do-majority-americans-live-states-legal-marijuana/	For the first time this week, Californians can celebrate "4/20," the unofficial pot holiday, by purchasing legal recreational cannabis at dispensaries across the state. Marijuana buffs trace the April 20th date to a story about five high school students in Marin County, Calif., who "created a ritual for getting high. They would meet at 4:20," in the afternoon, according to a short history behind the holiday. The time and date are now a core part of popular marijuana culture. Voters approved Proposition 64 in 2016, which allowed retail sales to start in January. It added California to what is currently a list of nine states, plus Washington D.C., where recreational marijuana is legal. But just how many people in the United States can legally use marijuana, in some form, on "4/20" or any other day? California Treasurer John Chiang made a recent claim saying: "A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis." Right before that, he noted that more states have approved medical marijuana than recreational pot. Still, we wondered: Was Chiang right that a majority of Americans live in states that have decided to legalize cannabis? Or was he blowing smoke? We set out on a fact check. RELATED: Pot 101: Facts you should know about California’s legal marijuana How much privacy do you have when you buy marijuana in California? TRUE: During campaign, Trump pledged to leave marijuana legalization up to states Our research Chiang, a Democrat who is running for governor, made his claim in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 29, 2018. He urged Sessions to establish federal banking rules for the cannabis industry. The letter was signed by state treasures from Oregon, Illinois and Pennsylvania, as well as several cannabis industry representatives. Marijuana remains illegal, in all forms, under federal law. In January, Sessions rescinded an Obama administration memo that recommended a hands-off approach to marijuana prosecution in states that have legalized pot. The move was seen as possibly paving the way for a federal crackdown on marijuana users and suppliers, though it’s uncertain whether that will happen. Different types of marijuana sit on display at Harborside marijuana dispensary, Monday, Jan. 1, 2018, in Oakland, Calif. Starting New Year's Day, recreational marijuana can be sold legally in California. (AP Photo/Mathew Sumner) To support the statement that "a majority" of Americans live in states that have legalized cannabis, a spokesman for Chiang pointed us to a November 2017 report by the treasurer’s office. It includes a map based on information from the National Conference of State Legislatures showing 44 states have some form of legal marijuana, ranging from adult recreational use to medical use to "limited medical" use in several states allowing "cannabis extracts." Based on that map, the vast majority of Americans do live in states that have decided to legalize cannabis. But it’s also the broadest collection of states we found and stretches the case on whether a state has really legalized any form of marijuana. We decided to limit our count to states where voters or a state legislature has approved a comprehensive law authorizing medical or recreational marijuana. We found 29 states, plus Washington D.C., that meet that criteria, based on news reports. Nine have legalized recreational marijuana while the rest have legalized medical marijuana. Marijuana Laws Infogram Even with this smaller group of states, however, Chiang’s statement holds up. There are more than 207 million people in these states, based on our review of census data. That’s easily a majority of America’s 325 million people. Our ruling California Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed: "A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis." His office pointed to a report that shows 44 states have some form of legal marijuana, though that list includes some states with only "limited medical marijuana" legalization and no comprehensive law authorizing the use. In reality, 29 states, plus Washington D.C., have passed laws authorizing recreational marijuana, medical marijuana or both. But even with this smaller group, Chiang’s statement is correct. That’s because more than 200 million Americans live in these states, representing a clear majority of the country’s 325 million people. We rate Chiang’s statement True.

pomt-13283	"I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-base-claim-about-michelle-obama-criti/	During the second presidential debate in St. Louis, Donald Trump tried to pull off the equivalent of making a bank shot while hanging upside down — that is, using the words of First Lady Michelle Obama to hammer Hillary Clinton. "I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you," Trump said. "And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary." This assertion caught us off-guard, since Michelle Obama has campaigned vigorously for Clinton in this election cycle, including a high-profile speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. We didn’t remember "vicious" attack ads from Obama during the 2008 campaign, either. So what’s going on? There are commercials out there showing Michelle Obama, but it’s not at all clear if she’s talking about Hillary Clinton. And the ads were made by a pro-Trump super PAC. What Michelle Obama said The Trump campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but he appears to be referring to comments made by Michelle Obama on Aug. 12, 2007, at a Women for Obama South Side Community Kickoff gathering at the Grand Ballroom, a historic venue in the Obamas’ hometown of Chicago. At the event, which took place during the 2008 primary contest, Michelle Obama said: "One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. Can't do it." Initially, these comments didn’t attract much attention, though a clip of the event was aired on a local Chicago television newscast. However, Michelle Obama made a similar comment on the stump during a visit to Atlantic, Iowa. Here’s what she said: "One of the most important things that we need to know about the next president of the United States is, is he somebody that shares our values? Is he somebody that respects family? Is (he) a good and decent person? So our view was that, if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. So, so we've adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first, so while he's traveling around, I do day trips. That means I get up in the morning, I get the girls ready, I get them off, I go and do trips, I'm home before bedtime. So the girls know that I was gone somewhere, but they don't care. They just know that I was at home to tuck them in at night, and it keeps them grounded, and, and children, the children in our country have to know that they come first. And our girls do and that's why we're doing this. We're in this race for not just our children, but all of our children." Michelle Obama’s comments in Iowa first attracted attention in an Aug. 23, 2007, dispatch by Chicago Sun-Times reporter Jennifer Hunter, who wrote that the comment "could be interpreted as a swipe at the Clintons." Hunter’s article was then picked up by the conservative Drudge Report, and from there various television networks and other news outlets followed up. Most reports mentioned the possibility that Michelle Obama was taking a veiled shot at the Clintons’ well-documented marital tribulations. Barack Obama rejected that interpretation, saying in a conference call with reporters that "there was no reference beyond her point that we have had an administration that talks a lot about family values but doesn’t follow through." He added that his wife often spoke about children and families in her remarks on the trail. It’s possible to see her words as a veiled shot at the Clinton’s marriage. It’s also possible that she was simply expressing pride in how her own family had arranged its affairs to make sure their young children weren’t left out. We will leave it to readers to decide which interpretation is closest to the mark. However, we are confident that Trump’s framing of Obama’s comments is incorrect. What ad is Trump referring to? Hearing Trump’s comments from the debate -- "I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you" -- it sounds as if he intends "they" to mean the Obamas. That would be a nice bit of opposition research for the Trump campaign. However, the Obamas never aired such commercials. Rather, an ad along those lines has been made by a pro-Donald Trump super PAC. The 30-second spot, titled, "Can’t Run Your House," airs footage taken by a local television station from Obama’s 2007 appearance in Chicago. That was the event in which she said, "One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. Can't do it." The ad was created by Make America Number 1, a group currently headed by Rebekah Mercer, whose father, hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, initially supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during the GOP primaries and then switched his support to Trump. Rebekah Mercer took over the top position at Make America Number 1 after veteran Republican strategist David Bossie left to join Trump’s campaign. By phrasing it the way he did, Trump implies that the Obamas ran ads against Clinton attacking their family life. In reality, it was a pro-Trump group that aired the ad in question -- and that makes a big difference in how powerful a point this is. Our ruling Trump said, "I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary." Trump is wrong to imply that Michelle Obama’s criticism came in an ad her husband ran against Hillary Clinton. Instead, it came from an ad made by a pro-Trump super PAC. And, the comments from Michelle Obama are somewhat oblique. They might be about Hillary Clinton, but they also might be simple pro-family sentiments. We rate Trump’s statement False.

pomt-08721	"Charlie Crist has six different positions on ObamaCare."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/02/marco-rubio/rubio-says-crist-has-taken-six-different-positions/	The media has written extensively about Gov. Charlie Crist's flip-flops amid his independent bid for U.S. Senate -- including about health care. One of his opponents, Republican Marco Rubio, says Crist has repeatedly changed his tune about the federal health care law that passed earlier this year. In a statement posted on Rubio's website Aug. 27, 2010, he wrote: "In light of political opportunist Charlie Crist taking his sixth position on ObamaCare today, U.S. Senate Republican nominee Marco Rubio issued the following statement: "Charlie Crist has six different positions on ObamaCare because he doesn’t actually care about health care, he only cares about getting himself elected. I’m the only candidate in this race who has opposed ObamaCare and vowed to repeal and replace it with a real reform plan that will lower costs, allow people to keep the coverage they have now and give individuals the same tax breaks businesses get to provide health care insurance. We all know Kendrick Meek is a liberal who strongly supports ObamaCare. But Charlie Crist’s political opportunism puts him in a league of his own. After changing his mind six times, I’m still not sure what he believes because he will likely change it again tomorrow." In this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore whether Crist has taken "six different positions" on the health care law. We've certainly heard of politicians -- including Crist -- flip-flopping about the health care bill, but is it possible to have six different positions? We're defining a "position" as a statement in support or opposition of something. First we contacted Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos and he sent us Rubio's six points. He added a seventh item. Let's look at each of them. Position #1 Crist called for repeal on March 21, 2010, as the U.S. House was voting on the bill, according to a March 21 Associated Press article. The AP wrote that the main reasons Crist opposed the law was that he said it raises taxes, raises premiums and significantly cuts Medicare. "Crist, a Republican who was in Tampa tonight attending the closing ceremony for the Gasparilla International Film Festival, said he hopes to get elected senator in November to help repeal the bill and bring a commonsense approach to healthcare reform. 'What people really want when it comes to health care, in my view, is they want greater access and less cost,' Crist said." We'll summarize as we go. So, Position #1, Crist was clearly against the bill and calling for repeal. Position #2 In a July 20 article, Crist told the Wall Street Journal that he was against repealing the law -- but only one sentence of the article summarizes his views on the health care bill: "Despite pledging as a Republican to help repeal President Obama's health-care overhaul, Mr. Crist now says he does not support such a move." Keep reading, because this is tied to Position #3. Position #3 In a more detailed exchange in the Wall Street Journal's Washington Wire blog the same day by the same reporter, Crist said the bill should be "modified" but does not call for repeal. Q: How do you feel about the health care overhaul? A: I think it needs to be improved. I’m concerned about so much government control for it. But there are, (at) the same time, there are good aspects to it. Q: Should it be repealed? A: I think it should be modified. It can be made better. Q: When the bill passed, you called for its repeal. A: Well, I wanted it to be changed….. People get caught up in, 'I’m going to say it’s going to be repealed' like they’re hammering their fist on the desk and be impressed with themselves. That’s part of the purity test. Q: Is that an example of something you had to do in the primary campaign as a Republican? A: Perhaps. And I just don’t have to do that anymore. I’m liberated to a greater degree, and I’m very happy about it. Position #2 and Position #3 here are essentially the same -- they were written by the same reporter on the same day -- one is a story that summarizes his view while the blog is a more detailed Q and A. So Position #2 and Position #3, basically, is to modify the law. Position #4 On July 29, Crist responded to his critics with a press release about his position on the health care bill: "FACT CHECK: Recent reports in the media have confused my position on the Obama health care bill. The Obama health care bill was too big, too expensive, and expanded the role of government far too much. Had I been in the United States Senate at the time, I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. But being an independent, I have the freedom to be an honest broker for the people of Florida without regard for political party, and the reality is this: despite its serious flaws, the Obama health care bill does have some positive aspects. Repeal must be accompanied by a responsible substitute -- repeal without passage of a substitute law protecting those with pre-existing conditions, closing the prescription drug donut hole for seniors, and allowing parents to keep their children on their insurance coverage until age 26 would be wrong. While I would not have supported the legislation, we have to recognize the positive components and work together across party lines to make our health care system more affordable for both consumers and the government. This debate must not be about political posturing; it must be about protecting the people of Florida and America, and I intend to do that hard work when I get to the United States Senate." In this statement, we find a fair measure of political double-speak. In summary, though, Crist is saying he would have voted against the bill and now wants to modify the law. He's offering more elaboration on why and how, but the position to modify is still the same as #2 and #3. Now hang on, next is where Crist really got into trouble for flip-flopping: Position #5 At noon on Aug. 27 on Central Florida News 13 Crist was asked how he would have voted on the health care bill. His answer: "I would have voted for it but I think it can be done better .... there is a part of it as it concerns me as it relates to Medicare.. I think we should have fixed that. It takes about $500 million out of Medicare, that's awfully important to our fellow Floridians and so before voting for it that would have had to have been fixed..." Position #5: Here, he's clearly saying he would have voted for the bill. But don't blink! Position #6 Just two hours later at 2 p.m., Crist's campaign sent out this statement: "If I misspoke, I want to be abundantly clear: the health care bill was too big, too expensive, and expanded the role of government far too much. Had I been in the United States Senate at the time, I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. But being an independent, I have the freedom to be an honest broker for the people of Florida without regard for political party, and the reality is this: despite its serious flaws, the health care bill does have some positive aspects. "Repeal must be accompanied by a responsible substitute -- repeal without passage of a substitute law protecting those with pre-existing conditions, closing the prescription drug donut hole for seniors, and allowing parents to keep their children on their insurance coverage until age 26 would be wrong. While I would not have supported the legislation, we have to recognize the positive components and work together across party lines to make our health care system more affordable for both consumers and the government. So finally, Position #6: He said he would have voted against it and he's back to modifying the bill. Additional perspective About that seventh item we mentioned earlier, it's an Aug. 29 interview with Ed Henry of CNN, and here is the CNN transcript. Crist said he supported parts of the bill and parts he takes issue with, that "what we need to do is fix it and we need to go forward." He's still sticking to modifying the bill. We asked Crist campaign spokesman Danny Kanner for a response to Rubio's claim that Crist stated six different positions. He referred us to a July 29 article on factcheck.org. Keep in mind that article was before the Aug. 27 TV flip-flop. The article dissects a July 22 Rubio ad which states "Charlie Crist now says he supports Obamacare." Factcheck concluded that Crist's position had shifted but that it was not "a complete reversal." Kanner also sent us a copy of Crist's statement following the noon Aug. 27 interview, which we quoted above. Summary We summarized as we went, but let's tabulate it one more time with dates. * March 21: Crist said he's against the bill and favors repeal. * July 20: Crist said he doesn't support repealing the bill and wants to modify it. * July 29: Crist again said he would have voted against the bill and wants to modify it. * Aug. 27, noon: Crist said he would have voted for the bill. * Aug. 27, 2 p.m.: Crist said he would have voted against the bill. Our ruling So we see three main positions here: Crist has said he was against the bill and wanted it repealed, Crist has said he would have voted for it, and Crist has said he wants to modify the bill. Where does that leave us? Rubio says Crist has had "six different positions" on the health care bill. We agree he has made conflicting statements about his views on the health care bill -- once it only took him two hours to contradict himself. But generally his positions can be summarized in three ways: he was opposed and wanted to repeal the law, he said he would have voted for the law, and he wants to modify the law. We think "six different positions" is the wrong number, but "different positions" is right on. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08610	The Bush administration had been "giving (auto companies) billions of dollars and just asking nothing in return."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/22/barack-obama/obama-says-bush-administration-put-no-conditions-a/	President Barack Obama defended his economic record to doubtful voters at a town hall broadcast on the economy on CNBC on Sept. 20, 2010. Obama continued to make a case he's made before, that unpopular initiatives can still be helpful to the economy. "You mentioned the auto industry," Obama told one questioner. "This is a great example of something that we did -- we knew it wasn't popular. I mean, the last thing folks wanted to see was us helping the auto industry. Now, keep in mind, the previous administration had been helping them, giving them billions of dollars and just asking nothing in return. "But we were at a point where two of the big three automakers were about to liquidate, in the midst of this huge recession, and we would have lost an additional million jobs as a consequence, but also lost what is a signature manufacturing industry in this country. I mean, we built the world auto industry. And so what we did was we said to the auto companies, we are going to help you, but you’ve got to make some changes." We'll leave it to posterity to decide whether saving America's automakers -- or bailing them out, depending on your point of view -- was the right thing for the government to do. What we noticed in Obama's statement was that "the previous administration had been helping them, giving them billions of dollars and just asking nothing in return." That's a claim at odds with the historical record. We first looked into this issue a few months ago when Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel made a similar claim on the Sunday morning show ABC's This Week. Economics blogger Keith Hennessey, a former Bush administration official, wrote a detailed rebuttal that caught our attention, and our own reporting confirmed much of his argument. Back in the fall of 2008, the Bush administration realized the automakers were in dire staights and looked to Congress to put together an aid package. But by December, Congress showed no intention of acting. So the Bush administration decided to go ahead on its own, using money the Treasury Department already had authorization to use through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. The Treasury Department released documents Dec. 19, 2008, that outlined conditions for $13.4 billion in loans it was offering General Motors and Chrysler. The documents show, and press reports from the time confirm, that the Bush administration put specific requirements on the auto companies that included paying down debt, limits on executive compensation and negotiated reductions in wages and benefits for autoworkers. It also required the companies to submit detailed restructuring plans by Feb. 17, 2009, to show how the companies planned to achieve and sustain "long-term viability, international competitiveness and energy efficiency." The requirements did have one clause that some critics of the plan said meant the details were nonbinding. The agreement said that the companies had to file additional reports by March 31, 2009, identifying any deviations from the requirements and explaining "why such deviations do not jeopardize the borrower's long-term viability." If the president's designee didn't approve the explanations, the loan would have to be paid back within 30 days. Still, coverage from the time indicates the auto companies thought the Bush administration's demands were plenty tough. The Detroit Free Press wrote that the loan agreements "not only call for deep concessions outlined in wide-ranging plans due by mid-February but also start a ticking bomb that could explode in Detroit's face unless dramatic change is on the way." The Wall Street Journal reported the loans were "just the first step in what could be a long and painful revamping of the three Detroit companies during a recession." The Detroit Free Press, in a 2009 eight-part series looking back at the auto industry's turmoil, again described the requirements as rigorous: "The deal set tough targets for the two companies -- a two-thirds cut in debt, a 50% reduction in payments to health care funds for UAW retirees and proof of net positive value by March 31. It also came with a threat: Should the automakers fall short, the loans would be called back immediately and bankruptcy would follow." These loan agreements happened after President Obama was elected but before he took office. At the time, Obama called the loans "necessary steps ... to help avoid a collapse of our auto industry." The March 31 deadline for the auto companies gave Obama about two months in office in which to make his own decisions about the companies. Obama said at the town hall meeting that "the previous administration had been helping (the auto companies), giving them billions of dollars and just asking nothing in return." The historical record indicates that the Bush administration did ask for things in return -- and even gave the Obama administration the power to recall the loans if the terms weren't meant. We know that Obama isn't a fan of the Bush administration, but this particular claim seems to be re-writing history. We rate Obama's statement False.

pomt-04732	Says "President Obama and his National Labor Relations Board" sued Boeing over its decision to open a plant in South Carolina.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/30/nikki-haley/haley-ties-obama-boeing-labor-dispute/	For Republicans, one of the clearest examples of ham-fisted government is a dispute last year between the airplane maker Boeing and the National Labor Relations Board. GOP candidates talked about it during the presidential primaries, and the story re-emerged during the first night of the Republican National Convention in Tampa. Nikki Haley, governor of South Carolina, said the state was "blessed" in 2009 when Boeing opened a plant to build the 787 Dreamliner in her state. "And what did President Obama and his National Labor Relations Board do?" Haley asked. "They sued this iconic American company." PolitiFact has examined the NLRB-Boeing conflict before. Just before the New Hampshire primary, Mitt Romney said the NLRB had told Boeing it couldn’t open a plant in a non-union state. We rated that False. Now, by calling it "his NLRB," Haley wants to tie Obama to the labor board's action against the company. So we will assess the accuracy of her statements. Boeing vs. the union About seven years ago, Boeing was ramping up to build its newest passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner. The company explored making all the planes at its factories in Washington state, but in 2009, it decided to start a second, smaller production line in South Carolina. The union plants in Puget Sound would make seven planes a month; the non-union facility in North Charleston, S.C. would produce three a month. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers complained. The NLRB’s general counsel tried to bring the parties together, but failed. In April 2011, the general counsel’s office formally started a hearing process against Boeing on the grounds that the company built its factory in South Carolina in order to punish the union. Retaliation of that sort, if proven, violates federal labor law. In December 2011, the union and Boeing struck a four-year deal that that provided raises, job protections and a commitment to make more planes in the Puget Sound area. With the South Carolina plant no longer seen as a threat to jobs in Washington state, the union dropped its complaint and the NLRB general counsel ended the hearing process. The president and the NLRB Haley cast the NLRB as an agency that is a direct extension of presidential power. Rob Godfrey, the governor’s spokesman, told us that this is accurate "because the NLRB is appointed by the president, entirely." He said that it is similar to "the thousands of boards that Governor Haley appoints and is then held accountable for the actions of." But the composition and presidential influence varies among different federal agencies, and it's a stretch to portray NLRB actions as directly managed by the Obama administration. "It’s not Obama’s NLRB," said William Gould, who chaired the labor board for over four years during the Clinton administration and is now a law professor at Stanford Law School. Gould disagreed with the NLRB decision to open hearings against Boeing but says the White House would be far removed from those activities. "It’s an independent quasi-judicial administrative agency," Gould said. "I am sure that the White House had absolutely nothing to do with this. During my 53-plus months, we never heard anything from the White House." Indeed, we could find no evidence that the White House intervened. The president’s spokesman, Jay Carney, told reporters "this was not something the president was involved in." The president does have a strong influence on the composition of the board itself. He alone nominates members who are then subject to Senate confirmation. Confirmation votes are easily blocked, and only two of the current members were approved by the Senate. The other two took their posts when the Senate was in recess and could not object. (Obama nominated all four.) But the Boeing case never came before the four current board members at all. The prime mover within the NLRB was its general counsel, Lafe Solomon. Obama appointed Solomon. The call for a hearing came when Solomon, who acts independently of the board, filed a complaint because there seemed to be enough evidence to make it stick. Based on such a complaint, the case went before an administrative judge. Had there been a ruling, only then would the case have gone to the NLRB to be voted up or down or changed. When the union and Boeing settled their dispute, Solomon said, "this is the outcome we have always preferred." The goal, Solomon said, is to foster negotiations between management and unions that protect workers’ rights. "The parties’ collective bargaining agreement does just that," he said. Later in her convention speech, Haley referred to fighting the lawsuit -- which technically was a hearing, not a suit -- and said that "we won." In reality, the company struck a deal with the union. That ended the legal process. Our ruling Haley said Obama and his National Labor Relations Board sued Boeing over its decision to open a plant in South Carolina. This oversimplifies a complex set of practices and relationships. The practices of the NLRB keep it many steps away from the president. In keeping with that process, the board members themselves did not take any action regarding Boeing. Obama’s greatest influence on the NLRB in this case can be found in his temporary appointment of the NLRB general counsel. The counsel decided to bring the case before an administrative judge. Haley refers to the government suing, whereas the process is best described as a hearing in which the NLRB represents the interests of the party making the complaint. There is a measure of truth given the president’s role in appointing the general counsel. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-06313	Says Suzanne Bonamici "supports the $500 billion cut to Medicare passed last year."	false	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/14/rob-cornilles/another-look-favorite-republican-talking-point/	Sometimes talking points are just so good that no matter how many times we point out they’re wrong, politicians keep using them again and again and again, broken-record style. Case in point: The Republican bit that some Democrat or another voted to cut a whopping $500 billion from Medicare by supporting President Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Just how pervasive is this claim? Well, PolitiFact Oregon addressed it more than a year ago when Scott Bruun tried to use it against Rep. Kurt Schrader and called the claim Mostly False. But that’s not all: PolitiFact National gave Michele Bachmann a Mostly False in September for claiming Obama was stealing $500 billion from Medicare. In July, PolitiFact Texas gave a state representative a Mostly False for claiming $500 billion in Medicare cuts were coming. And PolitiFact Ohio served up an out-and-out False to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in June for claiming that Sen. Sherrod Brown had voted to cut $500 billion from Medicare. There are more, but you probably get the idea. Naturally, we were a little surprised, then, when Rob Cornilles, the Republican candidate for the open 1st congressional district seat, accused state Sen. Suzanne Bonamici, his Democratic opponent, of supporting a $500 billion cut. And yet, there it was, during a speech he delivered Wednesday: "Senator Bonamici says she supports the $500 billion cut to Medicare passed last year." There’s a small bit of truth here. The Affordable Care Act does reduce Medicare spending by $500 billion over the next 10 years. But here’s the catch: Those dollars aren’t taken out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts, and nowhere does the bill actually eliminate any current benefits. The $500 billion is all in future spending reductions and come through the law’s attempts to slow projected growth, not cut spending. PolitiFact National has highlighted the biggest bits of savings: About $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in Medicare payments to health care providers. Another $36 billion comes from increasing premiums for higher-income beneficiaries. Administrative changes land another $12 billion in savings. A new national board is set to come up with $15.5 billion in savings -- but can’t get those savings from a reduction in benefits. The last big chunk of $136 billion comes in changes to the Medicare Advantage program, which has become more expensive than initially anticipated. Still, given all these changes, Medicare spending is expected to increase -- something we pointed out in our fact check on Bruun a year ago. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. As we said last year, while it’s true that the government is looking to reduce the growth of future spending, the Affordable Care Act does not eliminate $500 billion out of the current budget for Medicare. Most important, there are no cuts to guaranteed Medicare benefits. We wanted to do two things before we gave a final ruling on the subject. First up, we called Bonamici’s campaign to make sure she even supports the Affordable Care Act. She confirmed that, while she doesn’t think it’s perfect, had she been in office when the final vote was taken, she would have been a "yes." In a statement she added, "Let me be absolutely clear: I do not support cutting Medicare benefits. I believe Medicare is a fundamental promise our nation owes to seniors and keeping Medicare financially stable is simply a matter of getting our priorities straight." Second, we gave a call to Cornilles’ campaign to see if it still felt his statement was truthful. Mary Anne Ostrom, his campaign manager, said the campaign stood by the comment. She pointed to an Oregonian article before the health care bill passed that described the proposed savings as "cuts" (which it does, but it doesn’t make the claim any more accurate) and to a Washington Post Fact Checker article that she said backed them up -- at least to some degree. A quick read through that article, and we come to the same point: "The health care bill tries to identify ways to save money, and so the $500 billion figure comes from the difference over 10 years between anticipated Medicare spending (what is known as ‘the baseline’) and the changes the law makes to reduce spending." The author also noted -- and it’s worth repeating here -- that Republican leaders have supported the same cuts. "In the House Republican budget, lawmakers repealed the Obama health care law but retained all but $10 billion of the nearly $500 billion in Medicare savings, suggesting the actual policies enacted to achieve these spending reductions were not that objectionable to GOP lawmakers." Ultimately, even the Washington Post story that Cornilles claims as support found the claim to have "significant omissions and/or exaggerations." We pointed that out to Ostrom, who simply said the campaign didn’t agree with our interpretation -- or the previous PolitiFact interpretations for that matter. That brings us to our ruling. Generally, we’d give this a "Mostly False" given that there is a small kernel of truth to the statement. But we also have a policy of taking into account whether the speaker is willfully repeating something we’ve said wasn’t true before -- and in this case we have said it several times. For that reason, we’re giving Cornilles a False for his statement that Bonamici supports $500 billion in cuts to Medicare. Comment on the ruling at OregonLive.

pomt-14141	Says Ted Cruz’s father "was with Lee Harvey Oswald" before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/03/donald-trump/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-linking-ted-cruzs-f/	Straight from the grocery aisle tabloids ... Donald Trump is linking Ted Cruz's father to the plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. "(Cruz’s) father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald being, you know, shot. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous. What is this, right, prior to his being shot? And nobody even brings it up," Trump said on Fox and Friends on the morning of the critical Indiana primary. "What was he doing — what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death? Before the shooting? It’s horrible." Is it true that Rafael Cruz "was with" Oswald before the assassination, or was Trump’s bombshell accusation itself ridiculous? The Trump campaign didn’t get back to us. Cruz tore into Trump, calling the billionaire "utterly amoral" and "a pathological liar" and admitting sarcastically that his father had killed JFK, "is secretly Elvis" and that "Jimmy Hoffa is buried in his backyard." In an interview with ABC, Rafael Cruz called the claim "ludicrous" and "typical Donald Trump." Trump’s charge appears to be based on a National Enquirer report alleging that Rafael Cruz is the man standing next to Oswald in a photo from 1963. But technical experts told PolitiFact that no such firm conclusion is possible given the quality of the photograph, and several historians of the period told us they’ve never seen Cruz’s name come up in connection with Oswald. The 1963 photo at left shows Lee Harvey Oswald (left) and an unidentified man who the National Enquirer claims is Rafael Cruz, the father of Ted Cruz. A verified image of Cruz (in 1959 wearing glasses) is at right. Dubious photographic evidence The Enquirer based its report on photos of Oswald handing out pro-Fidel Castro pamphlets in New Orleans on Aug. 16, 1963, about four months before Kennedy’s assassination on Nov. 22. Two photo experts the tabloid hired — Mitch Goldstone of ScanMyPhotos, a digitizing photo service, and Carole Lieberman, a forensic expert witness — said another man in the image appears to be young Rafael Cruz, according to McClatchy. We could not independently verify these experts’ validation, as neither Goldstone nor Lieberman got back to us. When we reached out to Kairos, a Miami-based facial recognition software company, Chief Technology Officer Cole Calistra was skeptical about claims of a positive identification. Calistra told PolitiFact that the photos are too grainy "to perform a proper match one way or the other." James Wayman, the former director of U.S. National Biometric Test Center in the Clinton administration, said proper analysis requires two full-frontal facial images. "Without such images, no professional face examiner will be willing to render an opinion," he said. That being said, we had freelance programmer Lucien Gendrot test it out using Kairos’ face recognition API. The software could not verify a match between photos of the unidentified man next to Oswald and young Rafael Cruz, even at a low threshold of a 25 percent match. In short, as Snopes wrote in an April 2016 analysis of a similar claim, the low-resolution photos are essentially "of dark-haired young men with similar haircuts." That’s speculation, not evidence. Would Cruz and Oswald have even run in the same circles? No In his 2016 book, A Time for Action, Rafael Cruz acknowledges being an early supporter of Fidel Castro. Cruz had agitated against Cuba’s previous leader, dictator Fulgencio Batista, which led to a beating at the hands of Batista forces in 1957. Cruz eventually applied to universities in the United States, was accepted by the University of Texas, and left by ferry to Key West, where he made his way to Austin. He attended classes and worked as a dishwasher, a story his son would often repeat on the campaign trail. Back in Cuba, Batista fled under pressure from Castro’s forces, and Castro assumed power at the beginning of 1959. Later that year, during Cruz’s summer break from college, he returned to Cuba and was "shocked" by the nation’s turn to communism. He left, never to return, leaving close relatives behind. In the spring of 1962, Cruz writes, he accepted a job with IBM in Dallas, where he lived for a time with his wife and two daughters from his first marriage. At some point, Cruz moved to New Orleans to take a different job, although the timeline is unclear from his book. It was in New Orleans that Cruz met his second wife, Eleanor. They had a son, the future presidential candidate, in 1970, in the Canadian city of Calgary. So Cruz checks a couple of boxes relevant to Oswald -- a stay in New Orleans (where Oswald had lived and where the photograph in question was taken), a period in Dallas (where Oswald also lived, and where he assassinated Kennedy), and an interest in Cuba. But there is nothing to suggest that this is anything more than simple coincidence. Indeed, historians of the period say that it’s unlikely that someone like Cruz would have palled around with someone like Oswald. Cruz would have already been a staunch anti-communist for several years by the time he was allegedly photographed with Oswald. Given that Oswald was handing out leaflets for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee -- a pro-Castro group -- a partnership between the two men would make no sense on its face. Moreover, it’s believed that Oswald in this period was more of a lone wolf than an organization man. The Warren Commission report examining Kennedy’s assassination quoted Marina Oswald, his widow, saying "that her husband engaged in Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities ‘primarily for purposes of self-advertising. He wanted to be arrested. I think he wanted to get into the newspapers, so that he would be known.’ " This interpretation rings true for Van Gosse, a Franklin & Marshall College historian and author of Where the Boys Are: Cuba, Cold War America and the Making of a New Left. Gosse said that the Fair Play for Cuba Committee had "effectively ceased to exist by the middle of 1963," when the picture was taken. And to the extent the group was active at all by then, he said, it would have been in greater New York City, not a city in the South. In other words, whatever Oswald was doing pamphleting on that day in New Orleans was likely a freelance effort to "provoke something" that would get him attention, Gosse said. Tying Cruz to the photograph as an associate of Oswald "just looks like a fabrication," Gosse said. Other experts on the period agreed that it was unlikely that Oswald and Cruz had crossed paths. "Top leaders of anti-Castro organizations claim not to have met Cruz, and I have never come across his name in declassified records," said María Cristina García, a Cornell University historian and author of Havana USA: Cuban Exiles and Cuban Americans in South Florida, 1959-1994. "You can be sure that if there is any dirt on Rafael Cruz, the Castro government will find it and release it." William M. LeoGrande, an American University government professor and author of Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations between Washington and Havana, agreed. "I have never come across Mr. Cruz's name as a pro-Castro activist," he said. David Abraham, a law professor at the University of Miami, concurred that the pairing sounds unlikely. "I know of no evidence that would have put Cruz in the world of Oswald," Abraham said. "The Fair Play for Cuba Committee types were a mix of ideological supporters of socialist transformation and romantic innocents. Whatever one thinks Oswald was, Cruz was neither of these, so I would doubt that they would have met." And Steven Beschloss, author of The Gunman and His Mother: Lee Harvey Oswald, Marguerite Oswald and The Making of an Assassin, finds nothing to the supposed link. "Any effort to find a more meaningful connection that somehow implicates Cruz Sr. seems outlandish at best," Beschloss said. Our ruling Trump said that Rafael Cruz "was with Lee Harvey Oswald" before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The sole "evidence" for this claim is a grainy photograph that shows Oswald with a man who may bear a resemblance to Cruz. But experts tell PolitiFact that the image is too degraded to offer much confidence. At the same time, multiple experts about the world of early 1960s pro-Castro advocacy said they have never seen evidence of Cruz associating with Oswald and consider Trump’s claim implausible at best and ridiculous at worst. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c3361f8f-0108-4c22-874e-6ca77257190b	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-05-03T17:59:12	2016-05-03	['John_F._Kennedy', 'Lee_Harvey_Oswald']
pomt-03783	On recusing herself from cases after receiving a campaign contribution	no flip	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/29/patience-roggensack/fallone-campaign-says-roggensack-flip-flopped-recu/	Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack has come under major attack from opponent Ed Fallone for supporting a rule that says getting a campaign contribution from a litigant is not enough by itself to force a judge to step down from a case. Late in her re-election campaign, Roggensack for the first time said she would recuse herself anytime she received a $10,000 donation, and would consider doing so at a $1,000 threshold. Fallone’s campaign cried flip-flop. This is another case for our Flip-O-Meter, which we use to measure whether a political figure has changed positions. It’s not a measure of whether any change is good politics or good policy, just whether the person has been consistent. The relevant history dates to 2008, when the high court revised its ethics rules after two campaigns that saw heavy spending by special-interest groups in Supreme Court races. Roggensack complained of efforts to remove judges from cases and manipulate the outcome by making contributions in order to affect who could hear a case. The Wisconsin Realtors Association asked the court to establish a rule that a contribution or endorsement by itself is not enough to require recusal. Others took a different approach. The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin asked the court to require judges to step aside in cases involving a party or an attorney who spent $1,000 or more on their election campaign. In a 4-3 decision in 2009 supported by Roggensack, the court decided endorsements, campaign contributions and independently run ads in themselves are not enough to force a judge off of a case. The judicial ethics code still requires recusal if the judge has personal bias toward a litigant, has business ties to lawyers in a case, has a financial stake in the outcome, a relative is involved or the judge has taken a public position on the issue. Of course, the rule did not preclude judges from voluntarily removing themselves over a donation. But Fallone complained that it would discourage litigants from making recusal motions when they are concerned about the potential effect of a donation by the other side. Let’s look at what Roggensack said about the rule. "It will send a message that making lawful contributions is not a dishonorable thing to do, and it's not a dishonorable thing to receive," Roggensack told reporters in 2009. In a 2009 op-ed piece, she wrote: "If a person made a lawful campaign contribution and that caused the justice to be disqualified from deciding legal issues presented to the court, all of the other voters who chose that justice because they believed he or she was fair, independent and knowledgeable about the law would have their votes cancelled because of the justice's disqualification." The U.S. Constitution, Roggensack wrote in 2010, protected donations. "Money spent to communicate during an election has long been held to be an element of speech, and therefore such expenditures are protected by the First Amendment as well." Jump ahead to 2013. That’s when Fallone, a first-time candidate backed by many unions and liberal groups, portrayed Roggensack as having an ethics problem. He characterized the effect of the rule she supported as encouraging "legalized bribery." When Fallone again pressed the issue during a March 8, 2013, debate on Wisconsin Public Television, Roggensack surprised the Fallone camp. Asked by "Here and Now" moderator Frederica Freyberg how the candidates would show their freedom from the influence of campaign cash, Roggensack said: "I won’t participate if the contribution is above what I think is something that might give the public pause. You know there’s a $10,000 limit on contributions from individuals, and about $8,625 from a PAC, so my thoughts are much below that." She brought up as a possible "good benchmark" some limits she seemed to suggest Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson has used in the past -- $1,000 in individual donations and $8,625 from political action committees. (Abrahamson told us through a spokeswoman that she has never based recusal decisions solely on the size of the campaign contribution. Her practice has been to take no donations from parties with cases currently before the court or pending in the court -- and to return any donations received from such parties. For donations from lawyers, she assesses each one individually, weighing a variety of factors, we were told.) Roggensack went further March 27, 2010, on WUWM public radio’s "Lake Effect" show. Asked by host Mitch Teich if "there is a threshhold for you on what point there is a conflict of interest," Roggensack said: "Certainly if somebody contributed $10,000 to my campaign, which is lawful, I would not sit on that case." She added: "So, we’re looking at each contribution that comes in, and you know, when the chief justice ran her campaign, she had contributions of $1,000 from many people, and she never got off a case because of a contribution. Perhaps that’s something to look at. But we are looking at all of that." Indeed, the $10,000 threshold would apply to very few, if any, donations; it is the maximum individual donation allowed by law. If Roggensack were to adopt a $1,000 test, it would apply to many more contributions. Fallone has not specified what his personal threshold would be. We asked Roggensack campaign adviser Brandon Scholz if the justice had ever before set a donation threshold for automatically recusing herself. No, he said, and added she has not recused herself in her 10 years on the high court based on the size of a donation. But doing something for the first time does not a necessarily mean a flip-flop. We know Roggensack, in supporting the rule, rejected an alternative that would have set $1,000 as a recusal threshold. And now Roggensack suggests she’s considering that same threshold for herself. But there’s a crucial distinction: Roggensack is acting on her own in deciding when to recuse herself, while the League of Women Voters proposal she rejected would have required justices to get off a case. She was for judges deciding on their own, and she’s still for judges deciding on their own. We couldn’t find evidence that Roggensack ever said, prior to the 2013 campaign, that she would or would not set a personal threshold. Even League of Women Voters Wisconsin executive director Andrea Kaminski told us, "I don’t see that she is straying from anything she said before." So while there may be some irony here, and a political card well played by Roggensack, we don’t see a substantial change in position. That’s our official definition of a No Flip.

pomt-13576	"Neither Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump has a plan to address the civil war in Syria."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/aug/21/julie-pace/aps-pace-neither-trump-nor-clinton-has-plan-addres/	Viral footage of a stunned 5-year-old boy covered in blood and debris from an airstrike in Aleppo have refocused the world’s attention on the Syrian civil war. Five years in, the bloody conflict has left an estimated 470,000 dead, including the older brother of Omran Daqneesh, Ali. But Syria has been a blip in the U.S. presidential election, with both major party nominees more focused on fighting ISIS. Americans don’t know what Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton would do to respond to Syria’s civil war, less than three months from Election Day, said Julie Pace, chief White House correspondent for the Associated Press. "If you are a voter in this election and you look at that picture of that little boy and you feel sick to your stomach, like most of us do, you should look at your presidential candidates and demand a plan," Pace said Aug. 21 Fox News Sunday. "Neither Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump have a plan for addressing the civil war in Syria." Is it true that Clinton and Trump have yet to detail how they would tackle the war as commander in chief? For the most part, yes. As Pace said, Clinton and Trump have almost entirely focused on stopping ISIS, with little attention paid to the other crisis in Syria. How Syria fell into civil war Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, agreed with Pace that neither candidate has really tackled the civil war issue. "In fairness to them," he said, "it’s really difficult to address. The Obama administration has been tied in knots by it." The crisis in Syria involves myriad actors, confusing alliances and conflicting motives. According to the United Nations, no side’s hands are clean of war crimes including murder, torture and rape. Investigators have also found evidence of President Bashar al-Assad and ISIS using chemical weapons against civilians. More than 250,000 have died in the past five years, with millions displaced from the country. The crisis, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, is only getting worse. The situation started in the mid 2000s when a severe drought in the country’s breadbasket created an internal mass migration of refugees into Syrian cities already crowded by Iraqi migrants displaced by the Iraq war. This exacerbated existing problems like unemployment, corruption and brewing discontent with the Assad regime. The unrest reached its boiling point during the Arab Spring of 2011, when pro-democracy protesters took to the streets and were met with a government crackdown. That summer, opposition groups began taking up arms, and war erupted. Religious divides and foreign power proxy wars make the conflict even more complicated. Most of the rebels are Sunni Muslim, backed by Sunni countries, like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, while Assad’s security forces belong to the minority Alawite sect, aided by Shia regimes like Iran and Iraq, as well as Russia. In the early days of the war, the Obama administration (with Clinton as secretary of state) focused on overthrowing Assad and supported moderate rebel groups. But the United States’ priorities have shifted to airstrikes on ISIS targets. With that move, the United States has given Russia "freedom of action in backing Assad while the United States focuses on ISIS — choices that also empower Iran and raise critical questions about who will really win in Syria if the United States does defeat ISIS," Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a working paper. Where Clinton and Trump stand The record largely backs Pace’s claim that Clinton and Trump have yet to propose a comprehensive plan on how they would address the Syrian civil war. Clinton has given a few more specifics than Trump, whose campaign did not respond to us by deadline. Both candidates talked about the war at large in fall 2015, when Russia began bombing anti-Assad rebels. In an interview, Trump said he wanted to "sit back and ... see what happens." Clinton, breaking with the Obama administration, advocated for a no-fly zone, in which unauthorized aircraft are prohibited from entering the zone. Since then, Trump has said little regarding the civil war, keeping his focus on ISIS without a lot of specifics to preserve the element of surprise. When Trump does mention Syria, it’s to bolster his criticism of Clinton and Obama’s foreign policy or his proposal to ban Muslim immigrants and refugees. In recent months, Trump has repeatedly argued for working with Russia to "knock the hell out of ISIS." This position is more or less aligned with the current policy of learning to live with Assad, Gartenstein-Ross said. Trump has also called for safe zones, to be paid for by the Gulf States." Clinton has been more specific than Trump regarding the conflict at large. Here’s what she’s proposed as a presidential candidate: • A no-fly zone "that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians," • Creating safe havens for civilians, • More support for opposition forces, • Removing Assad through diplomacy, • Stopping the "ongoing bombing that Russia has carried out in support of the Assad regime against the Syrians." Both Pace and Gartenstein-Ross said Clinton’s varied ideas don’t amount to a full vision for ending the war. "It’s a recipe for escalating the conflict without resolving the civil war," he told us. "It’s unclear to me what the end game is and what the solution is." Neither candidate has said what should happen as a result of a piecemeal approach: Is the goal of a no-fly zone to help opposition groups oust Assad? Pace asked. Similarly, is the goal of working with the Russians on airstrikes to prop up Assad? The United States’ narrow strategy in Syria may be self-defeating in the end, according to Cordesman. Even if ISIS is defeated, any new government will be "hopelessly unstable" given all the ethnic and religious divisions and foreign involvement. "Both candidates may choose to continue to address these issues in silence, but there is even less doubt than in the case of Iraq as to what the real legacy of the Obama administration is likely to be by the spring of 2017," Cordesman wrote. "The transition plan seems to consist of a poison chalice." Pace acknowledged that the Syrian crisis "is one of the world’s most difficult problems," but said if the humanitarian crisis really matters to voters, they should make that known for this election and demand more clarity from the candidates. "One of them will inherit this problem," she said. Our ruling Pace said, "Neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump have a plan for addressing the civil war in Syria." This is largely accurate. Clinton has called for a no-fly zone and safe zones in Syria to give civilians reprieve from war and continues to advocate for the ousting of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Her plans for Syria are considerably less detailed than her proposals for many other issues on her website. Trump says he wants to build safe zones and to work with the Russians, who are backing Assad. These proposals are ideas and not comprehensive plans for ending the civil war. We rate Pace's claim Mostly True. Editor's note: The original version of this fact-check contained an inaccurate reference about Russia and the Assad regime. The article has been corrected to reflect Russia's support of Assad.​ This fact-check has also been updated with an additional proposal on Syria from Trump. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3d104f9e-2dd7-41d8-8af2-1ab86d7d0a8d	None	Julie Pace	None	None	None	2016-08-21T18:41:29	2016-08-21	['Syria', 'Donald_Trump']
pomt-05234	"In the 2000 Florida election, at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly dropped from voting rolls in an attempt to purge a list of felons. Many of those who were dropped showed up to vote and were told they could not."	true	/florida/statements/2012/jun/05/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-compares-rick-scotts-voter-purge-2000-/	An effort ordered by Gov. Rick Scott to purge Florida’s voter rolls of noncitizens had Sen. Bill Nelson feeling a sour case of déjà vu. Nelson, a Democrat, links the hunt for illegal voters with the 2000 election -- before anyone even uttered the word "recount" -- and Florida’s botched attempt to remove felons from the rolls ahead of election day. He warned Scott about repeating the ordeal in a May 29, 2012, letter. "In the 2000 Florida election, at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly dropped from voting rolls in an attempt to purge a list of felons," Nelson wrote. "Many of those who were dropped showed up to vote and were told they could not. And in a presidential election decided by 537 votes, that erroneous purge may have been a factor." PolitiFact Florida wanted to compare the millennial purge with the most recent one, which the Obama administration ordered the state to halt on grounds it violates two voter laws. We’ll examine the parallels and determine if Nelson offered an accurate recap of the number of voters affected by the infamous 2000 purge. 2000 As part of their 1998 elections reforms, state lawmakers told the Department of State to remove felons and other ineligible voters from the rolls after thousands of corrupt votes, including 100 votes by felons, were cast in a Miami mayoral election. The agency hired Boca Raton-based DTS Technologies, a subsidiary of ChoicePoint in Atlanta, for about $4 million to produce a list of probable and possible felons before the election. (Unlike most states, in Florida a felon’s civil rights are not restored unless he or she is granted clemency by the governor and Cabinet.) The company warned the state that many people on the list would not be felons, but officials wanted DTS to use broad parameters -- that meant more felons off the rolls. People whose names appeared on the list of more than 50,000 names had to prove their innocence or automatically be dropped from the rolls within several weeks of receiving written notice. Twenty counties ignored the state’s directive because they found the data unreliable, including the Madison County elections supervisor, who found her own name among suspected felon voters. News organizations unearthed numerous accounts of law-abiding citizens turned away at the polls because they could not prove their innocence. Several thousand people appealed to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and half were found to not be felons. The precise damage is pretty hard to calculate. "I’ve seen numbers all over the map," said Myrna Perez, senior counsel in the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, which is investigating the purge ordered by Scott. Nelson’s figure comes from a 2001 Palm Beach Post investigation, the crux of which asserts at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly purged before the 2000 election -- "the collateral damage from an aggressive and ill-conceived state plan to prevent felons from voting." The Post’s count included at least 108 citizens who were cleared after the election and 996 people who committed felonies in other states (they were supposed to retain their civil rights even in Florida). Other tallies put the number of bad targets 11 or 20 times higher. The NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union sued the state in 2000 partly over the felon voter purge, arguing it disenfranchised black voters. A consent decree from the lawsuit settlement required the state to run its old felon lists with new standards. The exercise resulted in 12,023 fewer Floridians making the felon list, meaning these people could have been targeted as felons and denied the right to vote, reported the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) in 2003. Some caveats: This figure does not mean 12,000 people were purged without cause. It means they could have been. Plus, some people within this class might not have been affected anyway because some supervisors decided not to enforce the purge. A massive story about the 2000 election by Vanity Fair identified 20,000 people who were wrongly included. We don’t know where that number comes from and will update this story if we find out. Nelson should have used that much bigger figure, said Leon County Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho. "I read the letter from Nelson and I laughed," Sancho said. "How come you didn’t vet this better? You could have had a way bigger number." We asked the state department for any data it might have but did not hear back. 2012 Twelve years later, Gov. Scott, who campaigned on a platform of cracking down on illegal immigrants, ordered state officials to clear the rolls of noncitizen voters. The state department whittled a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens to about 2,700 by comparing driver’s license data, which contains some citizenship data, against voter rolls. County supervisors, again, were told to notify those listed by mail of the need to urgently prove their citizenship. And also like last time, some supervisors decided to sit out the purge. Already, a Pasco County woman and a 91-year-old World War II veteran from Broward County have made headlines for being wrongfully targeted. In fact, elections supervisors found that most names on the list belong to citizens -- probably because the motor vehicle department’s citizenship information is out of date, the Miami Herald reported. Thirteen Miami-Dade residents have disclosed they are not citizens and ineligible to vote as a result of the purge, the Herald reported. It’s for reasons like this that Republicans stand by the clean-up efforts. "The implication of Nelson's letter is that eligible voters will not be able to vote, yet there is no evidence of this," said Kristen McDonald, RPOF spokeswoman. Still, voter-rights advocates and some elections supervisors share Nelson’s ominous sentiment. "It’s distressing and disheartening that this is happening again in Florida given the history of inaccurate voter purges of the past," Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project, which is a program within the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Rolling Stone waded into the issue with a scathing report, quoting Sancho as saying, "The state’s supervisors of elections are very, very disturbed." "This was dumped into our laps at the 11th hour. Those of us who have been here long enough get this eerie similarity to the flawed felon databases of 2000 in Florida," he told the magazine. Our ruling Nelson precisely cites a Palm Beach Post analysis that put the total number of people wrongfully dropped from the voter rolls in 2000 at about 1,100. Other estimates of wrongful targets are much higher, and experts about the 2000 election tend to go with those. Trouble is, we don’t have exact figures. However, Nelson’s broader point -- that a significant number of people were wrongly tossed from Florida’s voter rolls -- is valid. And he did say at least. We rate his statement True.

pomt-09402	"Hospitals, doctors, MRIs, surgeries and so forth are more extensively used and far more expensive in this country than they are in many other countries.''	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/22/mitt-romney/romney-overstates-united-states-medical-costs-and-/	While promoting his new book in an appearance on Fox News Sunday on March 7, 2010, Mitt Romney offered an interesting explanation of why health care costs so much in the United States. He said there are undoubtably some bad health insurance companies among the many in the United States, and they should be held accountable, but the industry is not the cause of increasing health care costs. "The president is scapegoating. It's something which he is fond to do any time one of his programs gets in trouble. He decides to pick a target and say, 'This is the cause of America's problem,' whether that's Wall Street, or Goldman Sachs, or bankers, or wealthy people, or whether it's insurance companies,'' Romney said. "To suggest that the overall health care cost of America, which, by the way, is dramatically higher than any other nation in the world, is because of the insurance companies is obviously quite silly. "Our health care costs are very, very high because we use a lot of health treatments. Hospitals, doctors, MRIs, surgeries and so forth are more extensively used and far more expensive in this country than they are in many other countries. It's not the insurance companies that are driving our health care cost up and up. The reason their premiums are going up is because doctor bills and hospital bills and usage and so forth is also going up.'' That's a lot to check -- hospitals, doctors, MRIs, surgeries --but we were game. We found that while Romney is correct in parts of the claim, he's wrong in others. Although "many countries" can be interpreted a lot of different ways, for the purposes of our analysis, we think it's fair to compare the United States with other economically developed countries in the world. Fortunately for our fact-checking, there's a group that compiles this data: the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, or OECD. They gather data from around the world on health, medicine, economics and other social indicators, and their statistics are widely respected. Let's start with hospitals. According to OECD data, Romney is correct about U.S. hospitals costing more, but wrong about them being more extensively used. As a percentage of the population, fewer Americans are admitted to hospitals, and spend less time in hospitals than the average country. The United States also has fewer hospital beds, with 3.1 beds per 1,000 people versus the OECD average of 5.7. The length of stay in a hospital for acute care is a full day less than in the average OECD country (5.5 versus 6.5 days), and the United States has 126.3 hospital discharges per 1,000 people versus the average 157.8. Discharges are used to measure the amount of visits to the hospital. Moving on to doctors, Romney is right again about what doctors are paid -- more in the United States -- but wrong that they're used more extensively. U.S. doctors are paid significantly more than the average doctor in other countries. The "price" includes fees and activities, so one reason U.S. doctors may be paid more is because they see more patients, but the OECD suspects that American doctors are largely paid more because their fees are higher. Doctors in the United States are paid $25,000 to $40,000 more than those in Britain, Germany and Canada. However, there are fewer practicing physicians in the United States than the average, and American patients have doctor consultations much less often than citizens do in other countries monitored by the OECD. In the United States there are 3.8 doctor consultations per person annually, which is almost half of the 6.8 average of countries monitored by the OECD. A consultation includes general practitioners and specialists, and includes almost any type of environment in which you would consult a doctor. The only caveat is that this does not include people like registered nurse practitioners, who are allowed to prescribe medicine to patients but are not doctors. Romney is unquestionably correct when it comes to MRIs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides doctors with a detailed image of, for instance, cardiovascular damage. The United States gives the most MRI exams of all the countries monitored by the OECD, with more than twice the average amount of exams given per year and twice the average amount of MRI machines as a percentage of the population. The International Federation of Health Plans, a group of private insurers in different countries, reports that the United States has significantly higher fees than Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, France and Britain. The average fee for an MRI exam in the United States is $1,200. It is $179 in Britain, $235 in Spain, $567 in the Netherlands and $839 in Germany. Regarding surgery, the United States appears to have an above-average amount of in-patient surgeries and ambulatory surgeries. Ambulatory surgery is a component of what is considered a day surgery -- an operation in which the patient leaves the clinic or hospital the same day. The United States has 92.8 in-patient surgeries per 1,000 people annually versus the average of 68.3. According to the OECD, ambulatory surgeries are especially disproportionate, with the United States having a rate three times greater than the average country. The OECD does not have data on the amount of total surgeries in the United States, but all the available data suggest that it has a higher rate of surgeries than the average of the countries the group monitors. It's fairly well established that the United States spends more on health care than other economically developed countries, so high costs do not come as a surprise. Romney was right about MRIs, surgery, hospitals and doctors all costing more in the United States. Regarding quantity, he was also right about higher rates of MRI exams and surgery here, but wrong about hospital usage and doctor consultations. We're rating this Mostly True.

pomt-09755	"Not only is there no scientific evidence that CO2 is a pollutant, higher CO2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/07/plantsneedco2org/plantsneedco2org-claim-carbon-dioxide-not-pollutan/	With Congress deep in a debate over legislation to slow climate change, the Washington Post has become a popular place for climate change claims, including this one from an organization called PlantsNeedCO2.org: "Not only is there no scientific evidence that CO 2 is a pollutant, higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life," according to an ad the group published Oct. 5, 2009, in the Post . To check this claim, we'll first need to travel back in time to high school biology, when we learned about a little life-sustaining process called photosynthesis. Plants pull carbon dioxide through tiny openings in their leaves where it combines with water and sunlight to create sugar and oxygen. Aside from maintaining normal oxygen levels in the atmosphere, life depends on photosynthesis as a source of energy. Carbon dioxide also plays an important role in climate change. This is naturally occuring — we release it into the atmosphere every time we exhale — but is also emitted when we burn fossil fuels. Along with other greenhouse gases, such as methane and sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide traps energy from the sun in the atmosphere, which causes the Earth's surface temperatures to rise. Most scientists agree that greenhouse gases are primarily responsible for climate change. PlantsNeedCO2.org is skeptical. The organization, which is still awaiting its nonprofit status, is the brainchild of Leighton Steward, a self-described geologist, environmentalist, author and retired energy industry executive. He authored a diet book called Sugar Busters! and is the chairman of the board of the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man at Southern Methodist University. We sent an e-mail to the organization but our inquiry was not returned. PlantsNeedCO2.org has one mission: "to educate the public on the positive effects of additional atmospheric CO 2 and help prevent the inadvertent negative impact to human, plant and animal life if we reduce CO 2 ." The Web site is chock-full of links to papers, videos and other evidence that more carbon dioxide is actually good for the environment. "Far from being a pollutant, rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will never directly harm human health, but will indirectly benefit humans in a number of ways," according to the site. "In addition to increasing the quantity of food available for human consumption, the rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration is also increasing the quality of the foods we eat." We're going to take the group's claims — that there is no scientific evidence that CO 2 is a pollutant and that higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life — one at a time. First, PlantsNeedCO2.org claims that there is no scientific evidence that carbon dioxide is a pollutant. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disagrees. On April 17, 2009, the agency said that thorough scientific review proved that carbon dioxide, along with several other greenhouse gases, are pollutants that threaten human health; it is taking steps to regulate the gases under the Clean Air Act, a law typically reserved for monitoring traditional pollutants including ozone and sulfur dioxide. "This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations," said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson in a press release. "In both magnitude and probability, climate change is an enormous problem. The greenhouse gases that are responsible for it endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of the Clean Air Act.'" The EPA's findings were "based on rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis of six gases — carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride — that have been the subject of intensive analysis by scientists around the world. The science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions, and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate," according to the press release. PlantsNeedCO2.org's second claim — that higher carbon dioxide concentrations boost plant and animal life — is not so clear-cut. To be sure, carbon dioxide is essential to life as we know it, and climate change skeptics have used the argument to reject efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. "Plant physiologists have known for a long time that most vegetation loves more carbon dioxide," wrote Roy Spencer, a scientist at the University of Alabama at Huntsville in a 2008 National Review article. "It grows faster, is more drought-tolerant, and is more efficient in its water use. While the pre-industrial CO 2 concentration of the atmosphere was only about 280 parts per million (ppm) by volume, and now it is around 380 ppm, some greenhouses pump it all the way up to around 1,000 ppm. How can environmentalists claim that helping vegetation to grow is a bad thing?" So, there's an argument to be made that carbon dioxide concentrations increase plant growth and abundance. But the claim leaves out some important facts, said Rob Jackson, a professor of global environmental change and biology at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment. "Is carbon dioxide good for plants? The narrow answer is yes," said Jackson. "But I think it's misleading to say that, if CO 2 is good for plants, it's good for the environment. ... It's kind of like saying that steroids are good for people — they build bone and muscle — but they also have other effects." For example, Jackson's research shows that with higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere we would see more wood growth, but that there may also be more pests due to higher temperatures, and longer droughts due to more evaporation. Beyond the reams of scientific research to demonstrate how dramatically the Earth could change with increased carbon dioxide levels, some studies indicate that more is not necessarily better for plants. For instance, a two-decade study of the Panama and Malaysia rainforests demonstrated that temperature increases of more than 1 degree could lead to 50 percent reduction in tree growth. A study launched in 1997 in California studied the effects of climate change on grasslands. Scientists doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, raised the temperature by 2 degrees, increased precipitation by 50 percent, and raised levels of nitrogen, which is also a product of fossil fuel consumption, to simulate how the Earth might look decades from now. When carbon dioxide levels alone were raised, plants grew quite a bit. "But when we factored in realistic treatments — warming, changes in nitrogen deposition, changes in precipitation — growth was actually suppressed," Christopher B. Field, a professor at Stanford, told ScienceDaily in 2002. But back to PlantsNeedCO2.org's claim. They are wrong that carbon dioxide is not considered a pollutant. According to the EPA, it is. And the claim that "higher CO 2 concentrations actually help ecosystems support more plant and animal life" leaves out some important details. While carbon dioxide is good for plants, increased amounts of it in our atmosphere will have auxiliary effects that are decidedly bad for ecosystems. For PlantsNeedCO2.org, it's False.

pomt-08342	Says state Senate candidate "Monk Elmer voted to exceed the (school district property tax) spending caps."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/28/american-federation-children/group-says-state-senate-candidate-monk-elmer-voted/	It’s hard to confuse a Bulldog with a Papermaker. And Idaho with Wisconsin. And a school district experiencing a state of emergency with one receiving national praise. But that’s what the American Federation for Children did in a direct mail piece sent to residents of the 1st state Senate District, which stretches from the Fox Cities northeast to include the Door County peninsula. The seat is open after the retirement of Sen. Alan Lasee, a Republican who had held it since 1977. Seeking to replace him are Democrat Monk Elmer, a family practice physician and president of the Kimberly school board, and former state Rep. Frank Lasee, a Republican and distant relative of Alan Lasee. The American Federation for Children, which advocates for school choice, is one of several outside groups active in the race, one of a handful that could determine control of the Senate. The group sent out a direct mail piece headlined "Knock Knock, Monk Elmer and Higher Taxes are Calling." It listed a variety of complaints, each with an official-looking footnote, including this one: "Monk Elmer just can’t stop spending ... Monk Elmer voted to exceed the spending caps." Among those receiving it: Elmer himself. Elmer, president of the Kimberly school board, didn’t recognize the name of the reporter or even the newspaper cited in the footnote: Amy Huddleston, Times-News correspondent. With good reason: The reporter and newspaper are in Idaho. The April 17, 2010 article from the Times-News in Twin Falls, Idaho, was about the Kimberly School District there declaring a fiscal state of emergency and approving a resolution seeking voter approval for a special $300,000 tax levy. Yikes. Tough to campaign for higher office when you’re president of that school board. Of the American Federation for Children, Elmer said: The group "thinks they can put down any information they want and they don’t think anybody’s checking them." We left messages at the group’s national office and for former Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen, who heads the group’s state operation, but received no reply. Elmer and the State Senate Democratic Campaign Committee complained publicly about the ad on Oct. 19, 2010. But there’s been no evidence that the group has modified the claim. Indeed, Elmer says it has shown up in other pieces of direct mail. Of course, Elmer is doing some explaining to voters about the school board’s budgets since he’s taken over as president in Kimberly, Wis. (home of the Papermakers, population 6,146) and not Kimberly, Idaho, (Bulldogs, pop. 2,614). The Kimberly, Wis. tax levy increased 0.2 percent to about $14.5 million in his first budget; for 2009-’10 the levy was up $1.2 million, or 8.4 percent, to $15.7 million. On Oct. 25, the board voted for a 2010-’11 tax levy of $16.67 million, up $989,000, or 6.3 percent. Yes, tax hikes. But no vote to exceed spending caps -- and no state of emergency. Elmer defended the tax increases, saying the district faced sharp cuts in state aid, while striving to provide excellent schools. Newsweek recently placed Kimberly (Wisconsin) on its list of the best school districts in the country (No. 1,637 out of 2,000, and 27th of the 32 state schools on the list.) Let’s conclude with an obvious geography lesson: In a key state Senate race, the American Federation for Children reached for a great headline and issue to use against Democratic candidate Monk Elmer. They reached all the way to Kimberly, Idaho, which is about 1,641 miles away from the home of Monk Elmer back in Kimberly, Wis. That’s about as far as that claim is from the truth. And that makes the claim ridiculous. Pants on Fire.	None	American Federation for Children	None	None	None	2010-10-28T09:00:00	2010-10-27	['None']
pomt-04925	"Today the Walton family of Walmart own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/31/bernie-sanders/sanders-says-walmart-heirs-own-more-wealth-bottom-/	Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, tweeted a startling statistic to his followers on July 22, 2012: "Today the Walton family of Walmart own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America." Sanders speaks and writes frequently about wealth distribution in the U.S., a hot-button issue among liberals and a rallying cry of the Occupy Wall Street Movement. The Waltons, of course, are members of the proverbial 1 percent. But are they really sitting on that much wealth? We decided to check it out. First, what is wealth? In economics, wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth, and it’s defined as the value of assets minus liabilities. For someone in the middle class, that could encompass the value of their 401(k) or other retirement accounts, bank savings and personal assets such as jewelry or cars, minus what they owe on a home mortgage, credit cards and a car note. It does not include income -- what people earn in wages. For that reason, someone who earns a good salary but has little savings and owes a lot of money on their house would have a negative net worth. In fact, because so many Americans invest in real estate to buy a home, middle-class wealth has been one of the biggest casualties of the housing-driven recession. From 2007 to 2010, typical families lost 39 percent of their wealth, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, done every three years. In 2007, the median family net worth was $126,400. In 2010, it was $77,300, according to the survey. Where the Waltons fit in Six members of the Walton family appear on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans. Christy Walton, widow of the late John Walton, leads the clan at No. 6 with a net worth of $25.3 billion as of March 2012. She is also the richest woman in the world for the seventh year in a row, according to Forbes. Here are the other five: No. 9: Jim Walton, $23.7 billion No. 10: Alice Walton, $23.3 billion No. 11: S. Robson Walton, oldest son of Sam Walton, $23.1 billion No. 103: Ann Walton Kroenke, $3.9 billion No. 139: Nancy Walton Laurie, $3.4 billion That’s a grand total of $102.7 billion for the whole family. Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist at the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California-Berkeley, compared the Waltons’ cumulative net worth with that of the overall population, as cited in the Survey of Consumer Finances. (She used the Waltons’ wealth from 2010, which was valued at $89.5 billion.) Allegretto found that in 2007, the wealth held by the six Waltons was equal to that of the bottom 30.5 percent of families in the U.S. In 2010, the Waltons’ share equaled the entire bottom 41.5 percent of families. That 41.5 percent represents nearly 49 million families, notes Josh Bivens at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. While median family wealth fell by 38.8 percent, Bivens wrote, the wealth of the Walton family members rose from $73.3 billion in 2007 to $89.5 billion in 2010, or about 22 percent growth. Other analysis At Forbes, source of the richest 400 list, Tim Worstall wrote a response to the Waltons wealth claim. He did not dispute the accuracy of the statistic but offered some broader perspective. "Wealth is always more unequally distributed than income," Worstall wrote. "By the way, it isn’t even true that all of those households with zero or negative wealth are what we would call poor, either. It’s entirely possible to have no net assets while having a good income, even a high income. All you need to have is debts higher than your assets: something that will almost certainly be true of anyone with student debt and fresh out of college, for example." He added: "If you’ve no debts and have $10 in your pocket you have more wealth than 25 percent of Americans." Bivens, for good measure, calculated the comparison of the Waltons vs. all Americans after removing households with a negative net worth -- those that drag down the overall average and make the Waltons’ advantage look greater. He found that the Walmart heirs’ $89.5 billion "is still equal to the combined net worth of the bottom 33.2 million families (about 28.2 percent of the total)." Our ruling Sanders tweeted that "the Walton family of Walmart own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America." The statistic correctly compares the combined net worth of the bottom 41.5 percent of American families with the six Walton family members. We think the additional points -- that many people with a negative net worth are not necessarily poor and that percentages about wealth distribution can be deceiving -- are important and interesting.

That's 270 people a day and 87 dead."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/23/facebook-posts/do-people-get-shot-every-year-facebook-post-says/	In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., Americans took to social media to express their views on guns and violence. A reader sent us one Facebook post about the extent of gun violence in the United States. It said, "USA is #1 in gun violence. Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead because of gun violence every day." In this item, we’ll look at the second half of that claim: "Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead." The numbers We turned to statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; experts in the field told us it keeps the most reliable statistics on the subject. The CDC collects two sets of relevant data. The first is data for deaths by guns, which is included in an annual report about deaths of all types during calendar year 2009. The numbers for gun deaths is broken down into several categories: Suicide: 18,735 deaths Homicide: 11,493 deaths Unintentional: 554 deaths Legal interventions: 333 deaths Undetermined: 232 deaths Total: 31,347 deaths The second data set tracks non-fatal injuries by guns. According to the CDC, there were 73,505 non-fatal firearm injuries in 2010. (We will ignore an additional 13,851 non-fatal injuries from BB or pellet guns.) How accurate is the Facebook post? If you add together the gun deaths and the non-fatal gun injuries, you get 104,852 people shot every year. That’s very close to what the Facebook post said. The Facebook post was also close in its daily averages -- 287 people shot every day, and 86 deaths by gun every day. There’s one area, however, in which the Facebook post could have benefited from additional context. It says that "nearly 100,000 people get shot every year," which to us suggests that a victim is being shot by someone else. In reality, a significant majority of gun deaths comes from self-inflicted firearm wounds. If you ignore the suicides -- and if you assume that relatively few people survive a suicide attempt with a firearm (we couldn’t find any hard data on that question) -- then the number of people who got shot, either fatally or non-fatally, was about 86,000, or roughly 235 a day. That’s lower than the Facebook post indicated. And the daily number of firearm deaths would be substantially lower -- 35 per day, rather than the 87 cited in the Facebook post. Our ruling The numbers in the Facebook post are close to accurate, as long as you make one major assumption -- that suicides count as "get(ting) shot." We think that assumption is debatable, but there is no question that at least 100,000 people did die or become injured from firearms. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01903	Says he lived in a colonia while working as a farm worker.	false	/texas/statements/2014/jul/02/david-alameel/alameel-lived-la-colonia-community-it-wasnt-coloni/	David Alameel, the Democratic nominee challenging Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told delegates to his party’s state convention last month he’ll fight for immigration reforms including a path to citizenship for residents living here without legal permission. Then Alameel, a wealthy Dallas investor, revealed a biographical detail potentially making him unique among all the Texans ever nominated for statewide office--saying he once lived in a colonia. According to the Texas Secretary of State, a colonia is "a residential area along the Texas-Mexico border that may lack some of the most basic living necessities, such as potable water and sewer systems, electricity, paved roads, and safe and sanitary housing." Per federal law, such colonias also persist in the states of Arizona, California and New Mexico. Here’s what Alameel said as he touched on immigration reform: "My wife’s family is from Zacatecas, Mexico. I have a large Mexican-American family. When I was working in the fields, we lived in the Colonia. Where people wanted me to go and see when I was running, I told them, ‘I lived ... I know what colonia is all about, I know what they need.’ " When we followed up, Alameel said by phone that in 1973-74 he and his wife lived with her parents in a humble house in an Oxnard, Calif., neighborhood called the Colonia. He picked chiles and strawberries in the area before enlisting in the U.S. Army. His campaign spokesman, Sergio Cantu, emailed us a photograph of what he described as a family reunion at the house several years ago. Photo of home in Oxnard, Calif., taken within the past few years. (Provided by David Alameel campaign.) Alameel told us the three-bedroom, one-bath house that was his home had typical amenities including running water and electricity and sewer services. The house also was safe and clean, he said, and the streets outside were paved. So, the Colonia neighborhood of Alameel’s past doesn’t fit the definition commonly used in Texas to describe a residential area lacking basic utilities. Still, "we were poor," Alameel said, and the neighborhood "was considered the roughest and toughest part of Oxnard." We found more history about La Colonia and Southern California’s Latin American community in a Nov. 1, 1992, Los Angeles Times news story. It called the area "Ventura County's most notorious pocket of poverty" with "a reputation as a violent, drug-choked neighborhood to be avoided." The story said residents "charge, and some city officials admit privately, that a practice of neglect has mired the old barrio in a tangle of social ills deliberately perpetuated to keep the area separate and not equal." The Times said the neighborhood "was born in the late 1800s to segregate Oxnard's Mexican work force from the gentry of the city." It quoted a newspaper from the early 1900s as saying: "While the east end of town was a rip-roaring slum . . . where crime and other illegal activities were concentrated, the westside was listening to lecture courses and classical music." By 1947, the story said, the barrio "was overcrowded and mostly inhabited by transient farm laborers who rented houses already considered substandard. La Colonia has been and remains a stop on the underground railroad for Mexican immigrants heading north." After World War II, "as veterans returned to a barrio of unpaved streets and outhouses, newly created political groups" drove the election of a Latino member of the Oxnard City Council," the story said, continuing: "During the consciousness-raising Chicano movement of the 1960s, when riots broke out in La Colonia to protest lousy conditions, residents elected the city's second Latino council member… Both elections brought measures of public improvements." In what proved to be our first interview, Alameel described another part of his life. For his first eight to 10 years, he said, he lived in one-room house in Haifa, Israel, its tin roof topped by stones. The house had no electricity and no running water, Alameel said, making his life tougher than what he’d encounter as an American. Alameel later called back, saying he didn’t mean to suggest in his speech that he lived in a colonia meeting any federal definition. His point, he said, was that he’d lived among migrant workers in the poorest, toughest neighborhood. He said he meant to convey he knows what it’s like to be poor. Our ruling Alameel told Democrats he once lived in a colonia. Not so. Alameel resided for a couple of years in a low-income Oxnard, Calif., neighborhood called La Colonia. By his account, though, that home had basic services like water and utility lines that are often absent from houses in Texas colonias. We rate this statement as False.

pomt-03565	Says Texas high school graduates must pass Algebra II to be eligible for automatic admission to state's public universities.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/may/21/leticia-van-de-putte/leticia-van-de-putte-says-algebra-ii-required-texa/	In an opinion article that ran in May 2013 in the Austin American-Statesman and other newspapers, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte warns that lawmakers could water down academic expectations for students, reducing college admissions. In the piece, the San Antonio Democrat suggested that yet-to-be-finalized versions of House Bill 5 would make it more likely that high school students take course loads that run short of preparing them for higher education. Versions approved by the House and Senate, she wrote, could result in students not taking Algebra II. "The problem is, Algebra II is required for eligibility in the automatic admissions program for Texas universities (aka the Top 10 Percent program)," Van de Putte said. We wondered if a student has to clear Algebra II to be considered under the 1997 automatic admission law, which entitles any graduate of a Texas high school ranking in the top 10 percent of his or her class, based on grade point average, to enroll at any of the state’s 38 public universities. (In 2009, lawmakers gave the University of Texas permission to limit automatically admitted students to 75 percent of its slots for freshmen from Texas. In recent years, that has meant students had to rank in the top 8 or 9 percent to be entitled to automatic admission to the Austin flagship.) And does Algebra II figure in? According to an information sheet posted online by the Texas Education Agency, a student is eligible for automatic admission under the law if he or she earned a grade point average in the top 10 percent of his or her graduating class. The student also must have met one of these two conditions: — Completed courses required under the state’s "recommended" or "distinguished achievement" graduation plans. Algebra II, we confirmed, is among the courses students must pass to graduate under those plans. — Tested well enough on the ACT or SAT, which students take while applying to college. Specifically, students must have "satisfied ACT’s College Readiness Benchmarks on the ACT assessment or earned on the SAT assessment a score of at least 1,500 out of 2,400 or the equivalent." So, one path to college admission under the 10 percent law requires Algebra II and the other path doesn’t. Dominic Chavez, a staff spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, told us the board does not have information on students who took the alternate path, but he said they probably comprise a "microscopic" share of all students seeking admission under the "top 10 percent" law "since overall only 24% of all Texas students meet the ACT college readiness benchmarks." Chavez said it would "be very difficult to meet the math benchmarks without taking Algebra II. Not impossible, but not very likely." Ed Colby, a spokesman for the Iowa-based ACT program, said by phone that the organization recommends that students take a minimum of three years of high school math, starting with Algebra I. Nationally in 2012, Colby said, 8 percent of students who reported taking less than three years of high-school math scored well enough on the ACT to meet its college readiness benchmarks in math; 13 percent of Texas students who took less than three years of such math met those benchmarks. We asked the University of Texas at Austin about the number of its students admitted thanks solely to their class ranks and SAT or ACT scores. By email, campus spokesman Gary Susswein said there is no way to determine that without a record-by-record search, but the share of Texas high-school graduates who enrolled at the university in fall 2012 without passing Algebra II was "minuscule." Broadly, he said, 89 percent of the admitted Texans had taken courses including Algebra II, while many of the remaining 11 percent had attended private high schools that certified their graduation requirements as including Algebra II, he said. By email, Nichols of Van de Putte’s office conceded that state law includes the ACT/SAT alternative path to gaining consideration under the "top 10 percent" mandate. But it’s a little-used "escape hatch," Nichols wrote. In reality, he said, "nobody plans to take the minimum (graduation) plan and then hope for a good test score. In reality, those hoping to qualify for top 10 percent need to take Algebra II." Nichols noted too that according to the coordinating board, 99 percent of students who enrolled in the state’s public universities from fall 2009 through fall 2011 had completed Algebra II--and 1 percent or fewer won admission without it. Our ruling Van de Putte said students must pass Algebra II to be eligible for college admission under the state’s "top 10 percent" law. Algebra II is among courses built into the state’s recognized or distinguished achievement graduation plans, which both qualify a graduate for consideration under the 10-percent law. But the law also enables a student to win consideration without taking Algebra II and other college-oriented courses by doing well on the ACT or SAT. Practically speaking, it makes sense to us that most high-ranking graduates seeking admission to the state’s public universities have taken Algebra II. However, it’s simply not required to qualify for consideration under the "top 10 percent" law, making this claim Mostly False.

pomt-09943	"The Department of Justice, under the Obama administration, disagrees with the decision" Judge Sotomayor made in the Ricci vs. DeStefano case.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/01/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-claims-department-justice-disagreed-soto/	Judge Sonia Sotomayor's ruling in a case involving a group of New Haven, Conn., firefighters continues to be the most talked about of the Supreme Court nominee's past cases. Sen. Mitch McConnell sought to make Sotomayor's opinion look out of the mainstream by telling CNN that the Obama administration's Justice Department had disagreed. We find the truth is not so simple. First, a quick explanation of the case: Ricci vs. DeStefano involves a group of mostly white firefighters who claimed reverse discrimination after the city threw out the results of promotional exams because white firefighters fared significantly better than black firefighters. If accepted, the test would have resulted in no black firefighters being eligible for promotion. The New Haven Civil Service Board said it was concerned the test may have violated "anti-disparate-impact requirements" of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and that the city would face an employment discrimination lawsuit from nonwhite applicants who were not promoted. So the board decided not to certify the exam results, and no one was promoted. Eighteen firefighters — 17 whites and one Hispanic — filed a lawsuit against the city claiming the decision not to certify the exam results "amounted to intentional discrimination" against the white firefighters in favor of black firefighters due to their race and political support for the mayor, John DeStefano. A federal district court judge who heard the case ruled in favor of the city, saying the city had the right to throw out the exams. The firefighters appealed to the 2nd Circuit, the court on which Sotomayor sits, and Sotomayor was part of a three-judge panel that upheld the district court decision. Now the case is being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. On CNN's "State of the Union" program on May 31, 2009, McConnell, the Senate's Republican leader, was asked what troubled him most about the case. McConnell said he had not yet read the case but "the Department of Justice, under the Obama administration, disagrees with the decision" Judge Sotomayor made. We have previously dissected some of the legal issues of this case, so here we are examining whether the U.S. Justice Department disagreed with Sotomayor's decision. In February 2009, the U.S. Justice Department did, in fact, enter a "friend of the court" brief asking the Supreme Court to vacate the appeals court ruling and "remand" the case back to the district court for further consideration of some issues. But that doesn't mean they asked the Supreme Court to reverse the appeals court decision and rule in favor of the firefighters. In fact, the Justice Department brief backed up many of the arguments made by the district court judge that were later affirmed by Sotomayor's appeals court. In one of the central issues of the case, the Justice Department attorneys argued an employer does not violate discrimination laws "when it decides not to certify the results of a promotional test in order to comply with the statute’s disparate-impact prohibition." "Nor is declining to certify test results the equivalent of 'racial balancing' or imposing 'quotas,'" the brief stated. However, the Justice Department argued that the district and appeals court failed to "adequately consider" whether the city was hiding behind a civil rights argument, using it as a pretext for "intentional racial discrimination" against white employees. In oral arguments before the Supreme Court on April 22, 2009, Edwin S. Kneedler, deputy solicitor general for the Justice Department, said that, in particular, the district court ought to look further into whether the city's decision to throw out the test was motivated by such factors as wanting to promote minority role models. As for McConnell's statement that the Justice Department "disagrees" with Sotomayor's decision, we don't think that's accurate. The Justice Department largely supports the legal arguments that underpinned the district court position in favor of the city, and which were later incorporated by the appeals court. But ultimately, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to send the case back to the lower court to reconsider some issues. And so we rule McConnell's statement Half True.

pomt-04549	"There’s at least 7,500 addicted gamblers in Rhode Island, at least, … it could be as high as 22,000."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/28/eugene-mckenna/president-concerned-citizens-against-casino-gambli/	This November, Rhode Island voters will decide if Twin River in Lincoln and Newport Grand in Newport should be allowed to become full-scale casinos. The state constitution requires that any expansion of gambling be approved not only by voters statewide but also by a majority of the voters in the city or town where the gambling facilities are located. On Sept. 13, 2012, Alliance for a Livable Newport held a forum to hear from supporters and opponents of the casino measure. Among the speakers was the Rev. Eugene J. McKenna, president of Concerned Citizens Against Casino Gambling, who talked about the social costs of gambling. He told the audience that according to Dr. Robert Breen, a psychiatrist who heads Rhode Island Hospital’s gambling treatment program, thousands of Rhode Islanders could be harmed by expanded gambling. "He said there’s at least 7,500 addicted gamblers in Rhode Island, at least," McKenna said, citing Breen. "He said it could be as high as 22,000." We wondered whether Father McKenna quoted the numbers accurately -- and where they came from -- so we called Breen, who heads the hospital’s gambling treatment program. In our phone interview, Breen confirmed the figures, saying they were derived from estimates of the rate of gambling addiction nationwide. If you apply those rates to Rhode Island’s population of about 1 million, he said, you come up with roughly 7,500 to 22,500. (For his calculation, he used addiction rates of .75 to 2.5 percent.) They were the same numbers Breen used in a commentary piece he wrote, published June 17, 2012, in The Providence Journal. When trying to estimate the number of gambling addicts in the United States, the first step is to define the term. Most academic analyses of the issue use the criteria set by the American Psychiatric Association. The criteria includes things such as needing to gamble larger and larger amounts to get the same excitement, returning the day after a big loss to try to win it back, lying to family members, therapists and others to conceal the extent of their gambling, and committing illegal acts to finance gambling. Studies spanning 35 years put the percentage of problem gamblers roughly in the range Breen and Father McKenna cited. However, not all problem gamblers are addicts. Most studies show there is a scale of severity, with only a third of problem gamblers reaching the most severe level, which the studies describe with different terms. For example, a 1976 University of Michigan study estimated the rate of lifetime "compulsive" gamblers to be .77 percent and the rate of potential compulsive gamblers to be 2.33 percent. In 1997, Howard J. Shaffer, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University Medical School and director of the school’s Division on Addiction, analyzed data from 119 studies on problem gambling in the United States and Canada. His report said 1.6 percent of the population meets the pathological gambler standard and 3.85 percent show signs of it. In a 2009 report,The National Center for Responsible Gaming, a research organization financed by the gambling industry, said Shaffer’s findings were still the norm. In that study, Christine Reilly, at the time executive director of the Institute for Research on Gambling Disorders, reviewed studies from 1976 to 2005 and said they all reflected the same range. "Prevalence estimates of disordered gambling within the general adult population have remained relatively stable from study to study, time to time and place to place," she wrote. Breen said he used prevalence rates developed by Rachel Volberg, president of Gemini Research in Northampton, Mass., which studies gambling and gambling-related issues. Shaffer said Breen’s overall number was right, but he made more of a distinction between compulsive and problem gamblers. "The most recent estimates of pathological gambling in the United States are about 0.6 or 0.7 percent of the population," Shaffer said. "Another 2-3 percent of the population experience subclinical [showing some signs of pathological gambling, but not all of them] gambling problems." Our Ruling The Rev. Eugene J. McKenna said that, based on rates found in national and international studies, there are between 7,500 and 22,500 adult gambling addicts in Rhode Island. Father McKenna accurately cited estimates by Breen, the Rhode Island Hospital doctor who treats problem gamblers. He, in turn, was citing ranges found in decades of research in North America. However, neither made it clear that those ranges covered a spectrum of problem gamblers, not all of whom are gambling addicts. Because the statement is accurate, but needs clarification, or additional information, we find it Mostly True.	None	Eugene McKenna	None	None	None	2012-09-28T00:01:00	2012-09-13	['Rhode_Island']
pomt-00458	Says Sen. Dean Heller "wants to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare to pay for tax cuts for his ultra-wealthy donors."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/16/jacky-rosen/would-heller-cut-social-security-or-medicare-pay-t/	The popularity of Social Security and Medicare cuts across party lines, so it’s no surprise their future comes up in campaigns. Nevada’s Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate Jacky Rosen took a shot at incumbent Republican Sen. Dean Heller as she received the endorsement of the Social Security Works PAC. "Social Security successfully lifts millions out of poverty and helps ensure economic security for Nevada seniors when they retire after a lifetime of hard work," Rosen said Aug. 13. "Unfortunately, Sen. Heller is yet another Washington politician who wants to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare to pay for tax cuts for his ultra-wealthy donors." Ever since passage of the Republican Tax Cut and Jobs Act, Democrats have leveled this sort of charge at Republicans. We’ll walk you through whether cuts to Social Security and Medicare are needed to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy. Key takeaways Heller voted for a Senate budget resolution, which over 10 years slowed the growth of Medicare by $473 billion less than projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Opinions differ on whether a slower growth rate is the same as a cut. Heller cosponsored a Senate balanced budget amendment, which would put pressure on lawmakers to curtail Social Security and Medicare spending. Nearly half of the benefits of the tax cut law (including both individual and corporate cuts) flow to the top 5 percent of taxpayers in the first year, and in the final year, about 83 percent goes to the top 1 percent of taxpayers. Neither the tax cuts nor a balanced budget amendment necessarily force cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Where Heller stands Heller’s campaign defended his record on protecting Medicare. "During his time in Congress, Dean has voted to prevent more than half a trillion dollars in Medicare cuts and has opposed changes to Medicare that would impact current and near-retirees who were promised they can rely on the program," said campaign spokesman Keith Schipper. The pivotal phrase there is "current and near-retirees." In the debate over Social Security and Medicare, it’s hard to find any lawmaker who would trim benefits in the short term. Both programs touch many lives, and as entitlement programs, they automatically lay claim to more and more of the federal budget. Together, they account for about 40 percent of all spending. Efforts to bring down that share very much focus on more gradual shifts that delay benefits or reduce them for people who are years away from retirement. Heller has said and done various things over the years that are subject to interpretation. Most concretely, in 2017, he supported a Senate budget resolution that set the stage for the tax cut bill. That resolution allowed the deficit to rise by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and included a spending path for Medicare that was $473 billion less than the baseline projected by the Congressional Budget Office. To be clear, Medicare spending would still increase, but not as quickly as the CBO said it would, all things being equal. Here’s a chart from the Senate Budget Committee: So there are a couple of points to highlight. We’ve noted before that since the resolution allowed deficits to rise by $1.5 trillion, you can’t say that any trims to Medicare help pay for the tax cuts. You could look to borrowed money as the source of cash. And then there’s the question of whether a slower rate of growth is the same as a cut. With more people retiring, the price tag goes up. If Washington were able to push health care costs down, more people could get the same benefits for less money. That’s a big if. If wealthy retirees got lower benefits, they might not feel the pain. But they could still see that as a loss. The devil, as they say, is in the details. Other key moves by Heller Heller voted for a plan by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., in 2011 that would have converted Medicare into a voucher program in which Washington would help people pay for premiums charged by private insurers. The CBO found that "under the proposal, most elderly people would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system." Heller is an original cosponsor of a 2017 Senate balanced budget proposal. Would that amendment force cuts in Social Security and Medicare? Potentially. "It doesn’t cut those programs directly," said Marc Goldwein with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "But it may force Congress to take action that would cut these programs. " On the other hand, Heller spokesman Schippen said that in 2011 "Heller was the only Republican senator to vote in support of a Democrat Balanced Budget Amendment that protected the revenue and outlays of Social Security from any balanced budget requirement." In short, Heller’s record presents a mixed bag for both his critics and his supporters. The tax bill The distribution of the GOP tax law benefits come with a measure of uncertainty that hinges on several factors but mainly how the economy and employers respond over time. The clearest estimate we have at hand comes from the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban and Brookings Institutions that draws on economists who have served in both Democratic and Republican administrations. By its estimate, about 45 percent of the tax benefits flow to the top 5 percent of taxpayers in the first year. By 2027, about 83 percent go to the top 1 percent. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Schipper with the Heller campaign counters that "the majority of the individual tax cuts go to taxpayers making less than $200,000 a year, and the share of taxes paid by the top 5 percent under the new tax law is greater than it was under previous law." That has merit, although his emphasis on individual tax cuts overlooks the impact of corporate rate cuts, which tilt heavily toward the wealthy. Our ruling Rosen said that Heller wants to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare to pay for tax cuts to the ultra-wealthy. Overall, his policies could make it more likely that spending on entitlements would be reined in. There is reasonable debate whether those changes would lead to a cut in benefits. And while the tax cuts favor the rich, it isn’t inevitable that the lost revenues will be made up for by trimming Social Security and Medicare. For a statement that is partially accurate but missing important details, we rate it Half True.

pomt-14623	Obamacare "is the biggest job-killer in this country -- millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-pants-fire-claim-health-care-law-nations/	To a man, the seven candidates on the stage at the Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, oppose Obamacare. When Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was asked what he would do for the millions of people who have gained health insurance thanks to the program, Cruz was quick to describe his take on the health care law’s failings. "First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster," Cruz said. "It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket." Virtually from the moment the Affordable Care Act was first debated, its critics have warned that it would wreck the economy. Those predictions, we found at least five times, were based on faulty evidence. Now Cruz is claiming that the critics were right, and it all has come to pass. Only that’s not true, either. At least in any way that the national data picks up. The government’s labor surveys give us a pretty good window into the number of people working in any given month. They also count the number of people who are working part-time but would rather have full-time work. We looked at those tallies at several points in the life of Obamacare: When it passed, when its earliest changes took effect, when people first got insured under the law, and today. The numbers run against Cruz’s statement. Not only has the number of jobs gone up, but the number of unwilling part-timers has gone down. We used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to build this table: April 2010 September 2010 January 2014 December 2015 Unemployment rate 9.9 9.5 6.6 5 Number of jobs (thousands) 139,297 139,396 145,092 149,929 Unwilling part-timers (thousands) 9,178 9,246 7,250 6,022 All of the job numbers have moved in a positive direction since April 2010, the first full month after President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. The unemployment rate has moved steadily from 9.9 percent to 5 percent. The economy has added about 10.7 million jobs. And the number of working people who have part-time work but would rather have full-time work has fallen by nearly 3 million. There was a brief rise in that number between April and September 2010, but the longer term trend is clearly one of decline. That’s not to say the Affordable Care Act deserves all the credit. The fact is many factors drive the labor market and the overall recovery from the Great Recession is the dominant player in this regard. Still, economist Gary Burtless at the Brookings Institution said job growth has been steady and nearly all of it has been in full-time positions. The pattern, he said contradicts "the prediction that the law would push employers to reduce the hours of their employees in order to avoid the law's penalties on employers who do not provide insurance to the full-time employees." "In the face of this evidence, critics of the Affordable Care Act keep telling us their predictions of the ‘job killing’ impacts of Obamacare have been borne out by experience," Burtless said. "So far as I can see, this is flatly untrue." Maxim Pinkovskiy, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, compared states that had very different starting points when Obamacare was passed. Pinkovskiy looked at Minnesota, a state with a low uninsurance rate, and Texas, where the uninsurance rate was relatively high. In his study, Texas was considered more exposed to the impacts of the Affordable Care Act because the law’s primary effect was to increase the number of insured people (despite Texas’ decision against expanding Medicaid). Pinkovskiy found that in terms of jobs, Texas grew at a faster clip than Minnesota. "More exposed states and counties have, if anything, experienced a rise in employment, salaries and output relative to less exposed areas with the implementation or the enactment of the ACA," Pinkovskiy wrote. Bowen Garrett, an economist at the Urban Institute, co-authored a study with colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago that compared states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare and those that didn’t. The researchers found no predictable effect on labor market trends. Garrett told us that based on some economic models, it’s possible that the Affordable Care Act could have increased the number of part-time jobs by about 250,000. "But that’s far from the millions some have claimed, and it’s not clear that the ACA is responsible," Garrett said. A study in Health Affairs found no evidence that the law has led to more part-time work overall, but within certain groups -- people with little education and those 60-64 years old -- there might be a modest rise. We reached out to the Cruz campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Cruz said that Obamacare cost the country millions of jobs and had forced millions into working part-time. The government’s employment surveys show no sign of that occurring. By every measure, millions more people are working and millions fewer are stuck unwillingly in part-time work since the time the Affordable Care Act became law. The law might have affected part-time work for certain kinds of people, but that didn’t change the improvement in the overall numbers. Many of these numbers, especially the well-reported unemployment rate, are readily available and independent economic studies uncovered no sign that job growth has suffered at all under the new health care law. Cruz turned familiar data upside down. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-01-29T13:54:21	2016-01-28	['United_States']
pomt-09710	Sen. Joe Lieberman's "home state has a public option which covers about 10,000 of its citizens that was introduced by its Republican governor."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/02/keith-olbermann/olbermann-claims-connecticut-has-public-plan/	Sen. Joe Lieberman, former Democrat and now independent from Connecticut, made headlines recently when he said he would join Republicans in a filibuster against a health care bill with a public option. Keith Olbermann brought it up on his Oct. 27, 2009, episode of Countdown . Olbermann said Lieberman was being hypocritical because, "he will side with the Republicans, denying Americans an up-or-down vote on any health care plan that includes the public option, even though his home state has a public option which covers about 10,000 of its citizens that was introduced by its Republican governor." Lieberman is crucial for the Democrats because he usually votes with them and in effect is the important 60th vote so they can overcome a Republican filibuster. Lieberman has said that he will side with the Democrats on a procedural motion to start debate on the health care bill (in theory, with Lieberman's support, Republicans could block bringing the bill to the Senate floor). But because he opposes the public option that's included in the bill, he has said he will side with Republicans on the ultimate vote to end the debate, which also requires 60 votes. And that means Senate consideration of the health care bill could stall. We contacted Olbermann's staff and found out that the Connecticut health plan he was referring to is the 1-year-old Charter Oak Health Plan, the state-run program that is designed to compete in the market for individual insurance policies. That means people who are buying individual health care plans — the unemployed, young college graduates, early retirees — can get coverage under Charter Oak. The state has contracted with three insurers to offer a variety of coverage options. Premiums and deductibles depend on household income. According to David Dearborn, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Jodi Rell, while the plan is "a state-sponsored, state-subsidized and state-administered health coverage program, we contract with private insurers ... as managed care organizations to coordinate the benefits, enroll and set rates with providers, and pay for the services." The insurance companies bear the risk for actual medical costs, not the state, Dearborn said. But the government is involved in the sense that people can get a government subsidy to help them buy private insurance. So is that a "public option" similar to the one offered in the Democrats' health care bills? We contacted Jacob Hacker, a health care expert at Yale University who is widely credited with coming up with the concept of a public option, for a definition. Generally speaking, a public option should look a lot like Medicare, Hacker said. It should be run by the government, and the government should bear the insurance risk. On the last point, Hacker said Connecticut's public option "falls into a gray area. It is not public in the same ways that the public health insurance option under consideration in Congress is. But it seems more public than, say, the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, which is often cited as a model for the so-called insurance exchanges." So it seems that the Connecticut plan is a hybrid of a public option and an insurance exchange. It allows consumers to choose from a limited number of health insurance options offered by private insurers, but it is sponsored, subsidized and administered by the state. Olbermann is correct on his second and third points. At the one-year anniversary of the program's existence, Rell, the Republican governor who introduced the program in 2007, estimated that about 10,000 had joined the plan. Rell's name and photograph have featured prominently on information about the program, and she's gone to bat to defend the plan several times since it was enacted in the summer of 2008. So, back to Olbermann's claim. The Charter Oak plan does not meet a strict definition of a public option. In fact, it bears some marks of a health insurance exchange, where private plans compete. But ultimately, it is sponsored and subsidized by the state of Connecticut and is open to the public, so Olbermann is mostly on the mark with his characterization of the program. On his other two points — that 10,000 people are enrolled and that it was introduced by a Republican governor — Olbermann is correct. All in all, we give him a Mostly True.

pomt-01881	The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office "received zero complaints" about the Washington Redskins name.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/09/blog-posting/us-patent-and-trademark-office-received-zero-compl/	There’s new hysteria surrounding the cancellation of the Washington Redskins trademark registration, and it goes like this: The government’s decision was much ado about nothing. After reading our fact-check about the Obama administration’s (lack of) direct involvement in the decision, a reader asked us to look into a claim from a conservative blog that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled the team’s trademark without public outcry to do so. One would think that the public outcry against such an "offensive, inflammatory" name must’ve been huge to gain the attention of a senator. People must have been writing tons of letters complaining about how racist the name was in order to get President Obama to weigh in on the issue. The number of complaints the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received about the Redskins name was astounding, but not because there were so many. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. The agency received zero complaints about the team’s name. Zero. The post by the Conservative Tribune deems this evidence of a left-wing scheme to win voters and open "the door for repealing the First Amendment." We checked it out and did not exactly find a scandal. Most notably, the post fails to mention why the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office considered canceling the trademarks in the first place: People complained about it. The Conservative Tribune blog post links to a story at Weasel Zippers, which links back to a story that first appeared in the conservative Washington Times newspaper. On June 18, 2014, a panel of three administrative law judges known as the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board canceled the team’s trademark registrations on the grounds that it disparages American Indians. As expected, the team is appealing the decision, just as it did when it challenged the same panel’s decision in 1999 in a related complaint and won. (The football team can keep the rights to its trademark as it goes through the appeals process.) Two weeks after the decision, the Washington Times ran a story about how the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could not produce any records that showed members of the public wrote in to express their opinions about the team’s name before the most recent ruling. The newspaper’s public records request for correspondence about the logo turned up 13 pages of records, half of which came from a Texas man who wrote a "meandering" letter by hand after the ruling. The other pages came from a person congratulating the appeals board and from staffers seeking background information about the case for Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting member of Congress from Washington, D.C. (and an opponent of the team’s name). Is it the "bombshell" as described by the Conservative Tribune website? Not really. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office does not solicit public comment like other government agencies as they consider new rules and regulations. It’s not built that way. Its process prescribed by the U.S. Code works similar to a legal trial, in which only the parties involved can submit evidence. There could be one letter or 1,000, but it’s not going to make a difference in whether a trademark is granted or canceled. Put another way, it’s not part of the process in the way that the Environmental Protection Agency or Federal Trade Commission reviews public input before considering a new rule or regulation. In this case, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office acts more like the Supreme Court, in that the court wouldn’t solicit or consider your opinion of the health care law before it issued a ruling. "The presence or absence of letters of complaint in a case like this really does not have any bearing on whether or not a trademark is going to be canceled," said Elizabeth Rowe, University of Florida College of Law professor and director of the Program in Intellectual Property Law. "If you want a trademark to be canceled, you have to do what the plaintiffs did here." The Redskins case deals with existing trademark registrations, which require investment on the part of people who seek to have the trademark canceled under federal code. In this case, five young people with American Indian heritage petitioned the Patent and Trademark Office in 2006 to cancel the registrations, arguing that it is disparaging. There is a brief period to allow for opposition to pending trademark applications, but a simple letter of complaint would not do much there either, Rowe said. That window is usually used by rival companies to assert whether a logo is too close to their own and confusing for consumers, and objections involve filing an objection, evidence to support it and having a hearing. "It’s really neither here nor there to say that they were letters of complaint or how many were there," Rowe said. The Washington Times article that called the missing public comment into question even echoes these points, quoting the plaintiffs’ attorney and a Georgetown University professor as saying public correspondence isn’t built into the process for hearing individual cases. For what it's worth, there are petitions at websites like Change.org and MoveOn.org in favor of changing the name or ditching it, and some have thousands of signatures. But the aim is to rally people about the issue and exert pressure on team ownership, not to influence the decisions of administrative law judges. Our ruling Conservative blog posts smell a scandal in the cancellation of the Washington Redskins trademark, pointing out that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office "received zero complaints" about it before an administrative law court ruled in June. The case was opened because someone complained -- so that assertion is wrong on its face. But even that aside, the post is misleading in suggesting that public comments are part of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office process when they are not. When people have a problem with patents and trademarks and want them removed, they file formal complaints, prove their standing in the case, pay a fee, and provide evidence to support their case. In other words, they do exactly what the five plaintiffs in this case did here. We rate the claim False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2014-07-09T11:06:28	2014-07-01	['None']
pomt-11889	"Youngest world leader bans George Soros’s Foundations from Austria."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/26/blog-posting/did-austrias-sebastian-kurz-ban-george-soros-organ/	A popular article on Facebook claims that Austria's incoming chancellor Sebastian Kurz has banned George Soros’ Open Society Foundations from the country. This is a fabricated tale made by a notorious fake news website. With the headline, "Youngest world leader bans George Soros’s Foundations from Austria," the YourNewsWire.com post said that the made-up ban was in response to Soros’ $18 billion donation to the organization, making it the second-biggest philanthropic organization in the United States. The article said that Kurz gave the organization 28 days to "cease and desist operations in Austria." The story falsely said the incoming chancellor called Soros "the greatest challenge humanity is facing in the world in 2017." The fake story goes on to quote Kurz describing Soros as "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming his blood funnel into anything that smells like money" — language identical to a 2010 Rolling Stone piece about Goldman Sachs by Matt Taibbi. Besides Soros’ massive donation and Kurz’s young leader status (he’s 31), this story is complete bogus. Open Society Foundations, an organization with efforts in different countries all over the world, has no offices in Austria — and therefore nothing to "cease and desist." We couldn’t find any record of Kurz describing Soros in that light or commenting on OSF. Soros was implicated during Kurz’s campaign when a Facebook page called "The Truth About Sebastian Kurz" accused the future chancellor, who supports low levels of immigration, of conspiring with Soros to let in a new wave of refugees. The Facebook page was later found to be set up by a consultant working for Kurz’s opponent, Christian Kern.

pomt-00265	Says U.S. Rep. John Faso "voted for an age tax on seniors."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2018/oct/03/antonio-delgado/antonio-delgado-misleads-claiming-john-faso-voted-/	Congressional hopeful Antonio Delgado is pitting U.S. Rep. John Faso against his senior constituents. The Democratic candidate is challenging the Republican incumbent for the House seat in New York’s 19th Congressional District, located in the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains. The district voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 by a margin of 6.8 percentage points. In a recent TV ad, Delgado says that Faso "paved the way for an age tax on seniors," while onscreen text displays that "Faso voted for an age tax on seniors." So did Faso vote in favor of a new "age tax" on senior citizens? That’s an exaggeration. What Faso voted for Delgado’s claim is a lot like other attacks we’ve seen against GOP House members who supported the American Health Care Act in 2017, as Faso did. (He voted in a committee that advanced the bill.) The failed attempt by Republicans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would have allowed insurers to hike premiums for certain older enrollees from up to five times more than what they would charge younger adults. The current law sets the cap at up to three times as much. The bill also would have allowed states to set a different ratio. But the ad fails to mention a few things. It doesn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or to people over the age of 50 with medical coverage sponsored by large employers. It also wasn’t a "tax" imposed by the government — the phrase "age tax" was dubbed by AARP, because the legislation was expected to increase premiums for the elderly. And — probably most importantly in this case — it doesn’t apply to New Yorkers. The New York exception In a news release, the Faso campaign argued that the plan would have had no impact on New York seniors because the state already restricts insurers from billing customers varying amounts based on age. The bill was voted into state law in the early 1990s. Faso cites the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think tank out of Albany, which marked Delgado’s claim as "particularly misleading in the context of New York State’s insurance market." In response, Delgado’s spokeswoman, Melissa Toufanian, said that while the age ratings wouldn’t have affected New Yorkers, Faso still voted for something that would have had negative consequences for seniors across the country. We also found that when he was an assemblyman, Faso actually voted against the bill prohibiting age rating when it came across the New York State Assembly in 1992. Despite his vote, the legislation passed with bipartisan support in a 118-25 vote and was signed into law, records show. Our ruling Delgado said in an ad that opponent Faso "voted for an age tax on seniors." The claim refers to Faso’s 2017 vote for the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, which would have permitted insurers to raise premiums on individuals over age 50 up to five times more than what they charged younger adults. However, the provision didn’t apply to those on Medicare, or people over the age of 50 with coverage through large employers. Also, it wouldn’t have affected New York seniors, as the state has prohibited insurers from charging higher rates based on age since the early 1990s. The claim contains elements of truth but glosses over details and ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02310	"22 Countries Invaded by the U.S. in 20 Years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/31/facebook-posts/viral-meme-says-united-states-has-invaded-22-count/	A Facebook meme argues that Americans are pretty two-faced when it comes to Russia’s recent annexation of Crimea. The meme says, "22 Countries Invaded by the U.S. in 20 Years. Russia Does It and Everyone Loses Their Mind," illustrating its point with a photograph of Heath Ledger’s Joker character from Batman movie The Dark Knight. A reader asked us to check this claim, so we did. Fortunately, the post that accompanied the meme listed the nations that had been "invaded," along with the years of the purported invasion. (We should point out the list is misnumbered and actually names 23 nations, not 22. And the time span is actually about 30 years, not 20.) Before we get to the list, which you can view here, we first need to define our terms. What qualifies as "invaded"? Defining invading Several foreign-policy experts told us that while "invaded" is a familiar word in general conversation, it is used much less commonly in international law. "Aggression" and "conquest" are more common, and a variety of international agreements attempt to define them. "The basic problem that is that everyone understands that some actions which are ‘invasions’ are nonetheless right and proper, and some are not," said Ted R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "The world being what it is, people do not agree on exactly which actions those are." When we asked Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service Anthony Clark Arend for his advice, he proposed a standard we could use to judge the meme’s claim. He said an "invasion" should meet each of the following three conditions: • It violated the U.N. Charter, which says in Article 2, Paragraph 4 that member countries shall refrain "from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state." • It didn’t qualify as a permitted exception for the use of force under the U.N. Charter. The charter permits military action in the case of "self-defense if an armed attack occurs" or if the U.N. Security Council authorizes armed force. • It involves ground troops entering another country. Given those parameters, we went through the Facebook post’s examples, categorizing the countries from most like an invasion to least like an invasion. There are two dozen examples here, so it’s going to take us some time to go through them all. Three cases clearly can be considered "invasions" Three instances would qualify as "invasions" under Arend’s framework without much argument. All were done without United Nations support and involved ground troops. • Grenada. Following a power struggle on the small Caribbean nation, President Ronald Reagan sent troops into Grenada on Oct. 25, 1983, with the mission of protecting American nationals and assisting "in the restoration of law and order." A force of about 5,000 American troops and 300 from nearby islands prevailed, evacuating several hundred Americans, and restoring a representative form of government. In all, 18 American forces were killed and 116 were wounded. While the invasion followed a request by five members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution of disapproval. A U.N. Security Council resolution of disapproval failed due to a U.S. veto. • Panama. Ironically, one of the clearest invasions wasn’t even on the list backing up the meme. Between 1988 and 1990, Panama experienced a period of instability stemming from the indictment of its leader, Manuel Noriega, for money laundering and drug trafficking charges. In December 1989, President George H.W. Bush ordered troops into the country to support 10,000 permanently stationed there. Their mission was to protect American lives and facilities, capture Noriega, and support establishment of a United States-recognized government. These goals were accomplished, with 23 American forces killed and 324 wounded. As in the case of Grenada, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion, but the United States, joined by the United Kingdom and France, vetoed a resolution of disapproval in the U.N. Security Council. • Iraq. When the United States led an invasion of Iraq in 2003 to oust Saddam Hussein, it did not have United Nations approval, and in fact, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan at the time called the U.S. invasion "illegal." So these are the easy cases. What about the rest? Seven cases might qualify as "invasions" if you use a broader definition Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla., said you could also use a broader definition for "invasion" -- namely, the seizure of territory by military force from the government of another country, regardless of motivation or justification. • Using this framework, U.S. military actions in Kuwait and Iraq in 1991 and in Afghanistan in 2001 would count as "invasions," even though each had a basis for support under international law. • A 1992 U.N.-backed, U.S.-led intervention in Somalia began as a humanitarian action but later morphed into a shooting war after militants attacked. This was in some ways an invasion, though the state of anarchy in Somalia suggests the territory taken was not controlled by "the government of another country." • In 1994 and 1995, the United States received U.N. backing to reinstall ousted Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president of Haiti, sending 20,000 troops at the peak. (Haiti was also omitted from the meme’s list.) • The interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo by the United States and NATO in the 1990s might also qualify as "invasions" using this definition. In Bosnia, the U.N. supported military action, and while it didn’t officially in Kosovo, Annan was quoted saying, "It is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed, but there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace." • Finally, the 2011, U.N.-approved NATO campaign to oust Muammar Qaddafi in Libya might also qualify as an "invasion," though the United States didn’t send ground troops, making the label somewhat questionable. (This, like Haiti, was inexplicably omitted from the meme’s list.) So in addition to three clear instances of "invasions" that lacked standing under international law, we have an additional seven actions that could be called "invasions" but without the meme’s pejorative use of the word, since they did have international backing. Fourteen cases simply aren’t "invasions" The rest of the examples cited in the meme do not qualify as "invasions" under any widely recognized definitions, experts say. They fall into a handful of categories. • Humanitarian or disaster assistance. This category includes Zaire, now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the U.S. military helped with refugees in 1996 and 1997 during the genocide in neighboring Rwanda. • Evacuation or protection of American citizens. This covers several cases of troops being sent to Liberia, Albania and Yemen, the last in the wake of the 2000 USS Cole bombing. • Service as U.N. peacekeepers. This covers a number of deployments to the Balkans, including a U.S. presence in Macedonia. • Deployments requested by the country in question. This covers the stationing of American forces in Saudi Arabia prior to the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. It also describes military involvement in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru in which the United States answered a request for military assistance to counter narco-trafficking, as well as assistance to Uganda and other African nations begun in 2011 to capture Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, a guerrilla group. And this category also covers Niger, which reached an accord with the United States in 2013 that would allow intelligence gathering and drone operations targeting neighboring Mali, which was grappling with advances by al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb. • Airstrikes. This includes the Aug. 20, 1998, strikes ordered by President Bill Clinton against targets in Sudan, after receiving intelligence -- later questioned -- of a link with the al Qaida bombing of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. This also increasingly includes drone attacks against alleged terrorist targets in countries such as Yemen. While these are clearly aggressive acts by the United States, they do not fit any conventional definition of invasion because they do not seek to take territory or overthrow a government. • Covert operations. During its battle against international terrorism, the United States has often used covert operations, such as in the killing of Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan and inside Mali. As with airstrikes, these are aggressive actions, but due in part to the small number of troops involved, they do not fit the traditional definition of "invasion." • No troops sent to the country. The United States took sides in Angola during a long-running civil war in the 1980s, but it is not believed to have sent military troops to the country. And the United States has not committed troops during the ongoing civil war in Syria. And one that’s ridiculous The meme cites the Virgin Islands, where President George H.W. Bush sent 1,000 military police following Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In reality, this can’t be an invasion because he sent them to the U.S. Virgin Islands — part of the United States. "If the point of the meme is to say the U.S. is sometimes a bully, or that we meddle in the affairs of many countries, that's hard to argue," Janda said. "But we don't invade sovereign states very often, and when we do we eventually leave, unless the host government asks us to stay. Even then, we don't annex foreign territory. We haven't done that since 1898." The difference with Russia in Crimea, Janda added, is that they "invaded and have already moved to annex the region. That's a textbook case of aggression and conquest, regardless of the casualties and what the opinion polls say in Crimea." Our ruling The Facebook meme said that the United States has "invaded" 22 countries in the past 20 years. Using the clearest standard -- ground troops seizing foreign territory without the backing of international law -- then the actual number of U.S. invasions in the past 30 years is three. An additional seven military actions that were supported by international law might perhaps be called "invasions" in a technical sense, even though they had official justification. The remaining examples cited by the meme aren’t even close to any conventional definition of "invasion." We rate the claim False.

pomt-02189	Ryan Sitton’s company "accepted over $650,000 in Obama stimulus dollars."	false	/texas/statements/2014/apr/25/young-conservatives-texas/company-led-ryan-sitton-applied-government-constru/	The Young Conservatives of Texas said Ryan Sitton, a candidate for the Republican nomination for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, once tapped economic stimulus aid ushered into place by the Democratic president, Barack Obama. Those are fightin' words for GOP voters wary of Obama's fingerprints. The group, which has endorsed the candidate facing off with Sitton in a May 27, 2014, primary runoff, former state Rep. Wayne Christian, said in a March 13, 2014, press release that Sitton’s company, "Pin(n)acleAIS, accepted over $650,000 in Obama stimulus dollars to expand their company." This claim, which Sitton's campaign urged us to check, has been found faulty before. We divined why. Two web posts By email, Jenna White of Austin, executive director of YCT, told us a web post by the nonprofit journalism organization ProPublica and a business news story posted online were the basis of its claim. The undated ProPublica post, headlined "How much stimulus funding is going to your county?," indicates that PinnacleAIS was awarded a Small Business Administration loan of $652,000 on Sept. 24, 2009. Sitton is president and CEO of Pasadena-based Pinnacle Asset Integrity Services, which describes itself as providing engineering consulting services and risk assessments. A story posted online Jan. 19, 2010, by GlobeSt.com, a commercial real estate news organization, described PinnacleAIS as on track to break ground on its headquarters building in Pasadena. Financing, the story said, had been delayed. From the story: "Sitton says PinnacleAIS didn’t have difficulty obtaining the financing, as the company is in strong financial shape. ‘This will be the first debt the company has taken on,’ he adds. Rather, the company’s executives decided to take advantage of stimulus funds and obtain financing through a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan, due to the better loan rates and less initial capital requirement. Dealing with a government entity like the SBA can take time, Sitton explains, but the attractive terms made it worth it." Chief financial officer says loan never closed Those web posts were inaccurate, Sitton’s campaign manager, Jared Craighead, and Steve Cory, PinnacleAIS’s chief financial officer, told us by phone. The company won approval of the described loan, Cory said, but ultimately closed a conventional bank loan to help cover construction costs. Specifically, Cory said, the Small Business Administration loan, which he described as totaling $621,000, never was closed, as in finalized. Instead, Cory said, PinnacleAIS obtained financing through JPMorgan Chase--a decision reached in 2011, about two years after construction began. Cory said the company concluded the higher closing cost of the government loan made it less appealing than the bank-loan alternative. Cory said that after we brought up the ProPublica web post, Pinnacle asked ProPublica to make a correction. To our query, a ProPublica spokeswoman, Minhee Cho, told us its stimulus funds' database hadn’t been updated since 2012. She added that it drew on the USASpending.gov website, where we found four entries indicating Pinnacle has sought SBA loans, though there was nothing about a loan of $650,000 or so. This stimulus charge percolated in 2012 when Sitton sought a Texas House seat. According to a Feb. 13, 2014, Texas Tribune news story, Sitton said then that he sought but never took out an SBA loan, and while that agency got help under the stimulus package, so did many. According to the story, the federal database of stimulus awards "shows none went to Pinnacle." That also was the case when we checked the list April 24, 2014. Group changing message We circled back to White, who said by email the group would amend its message. "We are changing the verbiage to ‘applied for federal stimulus dollars’ in a corrected press release to reflect the new information," White wrote. Postscript: Craighead emailed us an April 24, 2014, letter from Laquita Cyprian, a Houston-based Chase vice president, stating PinnacleAIS obtained its funding for the building project entirely "through conventional loan products by JPMorgan Chase." Craighead also forwarded an April 25, 2014, email from Ryann Jones, a ProPublica data reporter, stating the organization had "confirmed that PinnacleAIS’s entry in our Recovery Tracker is indeed outdated and we will be removing the entry as soon as possible." Both messages originated after YCT made its claim, so we didn’t consider them in our analysis. In fairness, our fact checks must be derived from information already known or obtainable at the time a claim is made. Our ruling YCT said Sitton’s company "accepted over $650,000 in Obama stimulus dollars." The company applied for a government loan identified by ProPublica and a business news publication as stimulus money. But the Sitton-led company says the money never flowed. We found no indications to the contrary and a federal website that tracks stimulus spending has no PinnacleAIS entry. We rate this statement as False.

pomt-03661	"Nearly 40,000 new jobs have been created in the last year due to the new wells . . . right here in Ohio."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/29/ohio-oil-and-gas-association/ohio-oil-and-gas-association-touts-40000-new-ohio-/	Environmental and economic concerns have been at the center of public discussion about the potential benefits and dangers of horizontal fracturing, or fracking, to release natural gas and oil from deep shale deposits in Ohio. The economic benefits, meaning jobs, are the focus of a TV ad that is also posted online by the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, the industry's leading voice in the state. "Notice Ohio's economy picking up lately?" the announcer asks. "The recent increase in drilling here right here in Ohio has led to adding jobs at a breakneck pace, and jobs are coming in all walks of life. From construction to restaurants to manufacturing, jobs are being created in all sectors of the economy. "Fact is, nearly 40,000 new jobs have been created in the last year due to the new wells. That's right -- almost 40,000 new jobs right here in Ohio. Renewing Ohio's heritage." The onscreen text says, "New jobs," "Real economic growth" and "40,000 new jobs." The addition of 40,000 jobs got the attention of PolitiFact Ohio, especially because the state as a whole had a net employment increase of 40,000 in 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. No source for the jobs figure was given with the ad, which we accessed on April 10, so we called the Oil and Gas Association and asked how it was supported. They referred us to "America's New Energy Future," a report by the global market information and research company IHS, Inc. Given wide coverage when it was released in December 2012, the report was commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Energy Institute, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Chemistry Council, America's Natural Gas Alliance and the Natural Gas Supply Association. The report includes state-by-state breakdowns on how many jobs have been created and are projected to 2035 due to shale exploration. It refers to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing as unconventional drilling. "In addition to manufacturing," the section on Ohio says, "gas drilling supports jobs in the transportation, construction and professional, scientific and technical sectors. Currently, unconventional drilling employment supports 38,000 jobs." The multi-state analysis uses a specific figure of 38,830 jobs for Ohio in 2012. It breaks those into three categories. It says that 4,200 of the jobs were directly involved in the oil and gas industry, or in "activities required to explore, produce, transport and deliver products." Another 13,601 were classified as indirectly involved, or employed in activities in outside industries that supply materials and services to the developers. The largest number of jobs -- 21,020 -- are identified as "induced" jobs. The report says that "Induced jobs are those that meet the new demand for consumer goods created by the increased income generated by the direct and indirect jobs," or "workers spending their wages and salaries on consumer goods and household items." The induced and other jobs are broken down in 15 industry categories that include administrative and support services; food services and drinking places; wholesalers, health care, construction, real estate and insurance. "All other industries" account for 11,115 of the induced jobs -- by far, the largest employment category for 2012. The source cited for the numbers in the IHS report is IHS Global Insight. IHS told us the direct jobs count came from federally published data, principally the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The remaining 34,000 jobs were the result of standard economic modeling from the published data. One of the authors of the IHS report, managing director of economic analysis Mohsen Bonakdarpour, told us that the figures for 2012 could be seen as a snapshot of the average number of jobs, full-time and part-time, supported by oil and gas drilling during the year. We also asked about the term "cross-state contributions," found deeper in the report. Bonakdarpour said it refers to material or personnel from another state. For example, he said, drillers in Pennsylvania might require equipment available from Oklahoma. The amount of cross-state contribution would be expected to diminish as the industry grows and matures in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio. We thought that was pertinent because media reports on shale gas have found a significant number of out-of-state workers, and Gov. John Kasich has said he has "deep concerns" that jobs were not going to Ohioans. According to the IHS report, the total number of oil and gas jobs in Ohio in 2012, "excluding cross-state contributions," came to 11,569. Seeking numbers from another source, we went to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. It issued "Ohio Shale," a quarterly report on trends in Ohio oil and gas industries, in February. Its shale-related employment report is a lagging survey -- going through the second quarter of 2012 -- because it is a hard count based on a census of employers. It shows that employment in core industries and 30 ancillary industries related to shale gas increased by a combined total of 5,628 jobs from the same period in 2011. The report notes "significant churn and turnover in the job market, as demonstrated by the levels of hires and separations." It says the levels of hires and separations suggest "a large temporary worker component." A worker is counted only once, however, the quarterly report says, even if the person holds more than one job. But the state cannot determine the residence of workers in the data. In a report issued in March, "Ohio Utica Shale Region Monitor," researchers at Cleveland State University's Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs found a spending surge in 2012 but not many new jobs. The researchers analyzed total employment for 2011 and 2012 in 13 eastern Ohio counties where shale gas and oil production was underway, and compared the data to the rest of the state. They found that employment growth due to shale development was not evident: employment rose 1.4 percent year-over-year in counties with heavy or moderate shale production, compared to 1.3 percent in other counties without shale development. PolitiFact Ohio is not rating either the benefits or drawbacks of drilling. We are checking the statement, from the OOGA ad, that "nearly 40,000 new jobs have been created in the last year due to the new wells... right here in Ohio." The figure of "nearly 40,000" is an accurate reference to the IHS report. And the ad's reference to jobs "in all walks of life" does indicate that the jobs net is being cast over a wide area not solely restricted to drilling. But the reality and relevance of the number in the context of the ad is undermined considerably by the fact that it is not the result of surveying but of modeling; that fewer than half of its nearly 40,000 jobs are directly or indirectly related to drilling, and that the single largest element -- almost 30 percent of the jobs total -- consists of unidentified "induced" jobs. We think the ad's reference to the creation of new jobs would reasonably be taken as referring to permanent or continuing jobs, not temporary employment. Further, the touting of jobs "right here in Ohio" that are "restoring Ohio's heritage" is not supported by the substantial percentage of jobs going to out-of-state workers, even if that percentage is diminishing. Finally, the IHS report says its figure of 38,830 jobs refers to total jobs supported by drilling during 2012, not to new jobs created in the year, as the ad claims. And the words matter. The IHS report itself makes clear that there is a difference between jobs that are "created" by the industry -- which, in a generous reckoning, would encompass direct and indirect jobs -- and jobs that are "supported," which would be all of the 21,020 induced jobs. That’s an important distinction that the ad ignores, and it accounts for more than half the jobs that the ad claims. So the association has misrepresented its own industry’s study with compounded exaggerations. The Truth-O-Meter says Pants on Fire!

pomt-14160	Says Ann Kirkpatrick "votes with her party nearly 90 percent of the time."	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/apr/29/arizona-grassroots-action-pac/pro-mccain-pac-says-democratic-challenger-votes-pa/	The race for John McCain’s U.S. Senate seat is in full swing in Arizona. The senior senator already said he’s skipping July’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland to campaign for this sixth term. His challengers include fellow Republican Kelli Ward and U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz. The primary is scheduled for Aug. 30. We came across an advertisement attacking Kirkpatrick, which comes from the Arizona Grassroots Action Political Action Committee. "She votes with her party nearly 90 percent of the time," the ad states, as the graphic shows Kirkpatrick and President Barack Obama side by side. Although the PAC’s ad says it is not authorized by any candidate or committee, they’ve taken a pro-McCain stance, spending wise, in this Senate race. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the PAC has spent $211,547 against Ward in the last two weeks. They’ve also spent $45,050 supporting McCain. But what about Kirkpatrick and her voting record? We reached out to the PAC and did not hear back. Still, the ad’s claim checks out based on the numbers we found. According to CQ Roll Call, which tracks and analyzes congressional data, Kirkpatrick sided with her party 88 percent of the time in 2014 and 84 percent in 2013. Although, her support of Obama was 76 percent in 2014 and 77 percent in 2013. CQ defines "presidential support" as voting in agreement with the president’s position. We reached out to the Kirkpatrick campaign, and spokesman D.B. Mitchell did provide us with several examples of the congresswoman voting against party lines. In June 2015, Kirkpatrick was one of only eight Democrats to vote for the Ratepayer Protection Act, which would have delayed compliance with carbon dioxide emissions for states. It passed with support from 239 Republicans. And in 2009, she voted against the American Clean Energy and Securities Act, which would have allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to set greenhouse gas limits (211 Democrats voted for it). Finally, we should note that, historically, most members of Congress vote along party lines, and the partisan divide has worsened in the last 60 years. Our ruling The Arizona Grassroots PAC said that Kirkpatrick "votes with her party nearly 90 percent of the time." The data backs up this claim. However, her campaign can point to a couple of instances where Kirkpatrick did cross party lines on votes. We rate the ad as Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3fe94ae0-4fa0-45e4-95c8-173ac8dad618	None	Arizona Grassroots Action PAC	None	None	None	2016-04-29T13:35:52	2016-03-01	['None']
pomt-08943	"I think it is unacceptable for the Chinese today to be larger in wind power and in solar panels and photovoltaic manufacturing than all of Europe put together -- forget the United States."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/23/maurice-ferre/ferre-half-true-chinas-rise-energy-leader/	On June 1, 2010, Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, Maurice Ferre, dropped by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newsroom and met with the editorial board. Among other things, he talked about a new economic development policy based on moving the country away from dependence on oil. Near the end of the 7:12-minute-long clip posted on YouTube, Ferre weighs in on the need for the United States to pursue renewable energy sources. He also laments our standing in the world in the renewables sector: "I think it is unacceptable for the Chinese today to be larger in wind power and in solar panels and photovoltaic manufacturing than all of Europe put together—forget the United States." In other words, Ferre, a former mayor of Miami, is bothered that China has emerged in recent years as a global leader in the manufacturing of windmills, solar panels, and other off-the-grid gadgets, and Europe and the United States are left in the dust. We wondered whether he's right about China’s dominance and how far ahead it really is. We asked Ferre where his numbers came from, and he said he read it in The Economist recently though he didn't have specifics. We tracked down a Feb. 3 article in the monthly magazine. Titled "Blown Away: China and America added most wind capacity in 2009," the article was about how America's "reign could be short-lived as China continues its enormous rate of increase" in wind capacity. Bear in mind, though, this was about the amount of energy produced by wind technology in China, not about wind-turbine manufacturing. Similarly, the nonprofits we found that study global renewable energy focus mainly on the production and energy capacity of a country -- and not so much its manufacturing. In other words, they don't concentrate solely on the building of wind turbines and solar panels. We contacted Worldwatch Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank that issued an 80-page "Global Status Report" on renewable energy earlier this year. Ferre is indeed correct when he notes the rise of China as it becomes a competitive force in the renewable energy sector. "Manufacturing leadership is shifting from Europe to Asia as countries like China, India, and South Korea continue to increase their commitments to renewable energy," opens the report. "In 2009, China produced 40 percent of the world's solar [photovoltaic] supply, 30 percent of the world's wind turbines (up from 10 percent in 2007), and 77 percent of the world's solar hot water collectors." The report offers a breakdown of the market shares of the top 10 wind turbine manufacturers for 2009, and the market shares for the top 15 solar photovoltaic, or PV, manufacturers, for 2009. (Photovoltaic manufacturers make solar cells, usually out of silicon, that convert the sun's light into electricity. Solar cells are what's inside the solar panels we're familiar with.) Among wind turbine manufacturers, China holds 21 percent of the market, compared to Europe's 38 percent. India, the United States, and "others" make up 39 percent. It must be noted that both lists don't take into account the remaining firms. Among market shares for the top 15 solar PV manufacturers, China came out on top, according to the Worldwatch Institute report, with 23 percent, compared to Europe's 5 percent and the United States' 14 percent. "It's been the manufacturing leader in photovoltaic modules for at least a couple of years, and long ago took the lead in solar water heating components," wrote Seth Masia, deputy editor of SOLAR TODAY, a magazine affiliated with the nonprofit American Solar Energy Society. Indeed, China's ascent as a photovoltaic manufacturer is consistent with what we found elsewhere. Once dominating as the world's largest PV manufacturer (in the 1980s), the United States has since lost its footing. In 2008, the U.S. produced only 5 percent of the world's solar cells, with Europe and Asia leading global production, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The European Photovoltaic Industry Association reports that in 2009 China manufactured 54 percent of the world’s silicon module capacity, compared to 28 percent for Europe and 5 percent for the US. It would have been so much easier for PolitiFact to check on the production of energy rather than equipment, and China does have a good story to tell in energy capacity. China added more renewable-power capacity than any other country in the world in 2009, according to the Worldwatch Institute. But Ferre's point was manufacturing when he met with the Sun-Sentinel editorial board. His statement that China is larger than Europe and the United States in the manufacturing of wind and solar power equipment is correct for photovoltaics, but not for wind. The Worldwatch Insitute report points out that, among the world’s top 15 wind turbine manufacturers, Europe came out ahead of China in 2009. That gives Ferre's statement a rating of Half True.

pomt-13435	"Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-correct-hispanic-wealth-disproport/	Hillary Clinton promised to "connect more Latinos with good-paying jobs that pay good wages" when she spoke on Sept. 15, 2016, at the 39th Annual Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Public Policy Conference and Annual Awards Gala in Washington. "We need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top," the Democratic presidential candidate said. "There's something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth." We decided to fact-check those percentages, recognizing that although the federal government considers Latino to be synonymous with Hispanic, many people make a distinction. Because we'll be using government data, we'll consider the terms comparable. First, a bit of history. The Great Recession had a much more devastating effect on Hispanics than on whites. The Pew Research Center found that while median wealth for whites fell 16 percent after the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent recession, it fell by 66 percent for Hispanic households. Wealth includes all savings, investments and property, minus the value of debt, such as car loans, mortgages and credit card debt. In 2009, median net worth for whites was $113,149. It was $6,325 for Hispanics. Four years earlier, the numbers were $134,992 for whites, $18,359 for Hispanics. "Hispanics (were) hit hardest by the meltdown in the housing market," the Pew report said. When it comes to specific percentages, the Clinton campaign sent us two two reports. The first was from the Census Bureau, which pegged the Hispanic population at 17 percent as of July 1, 2014. That confirms the first part of Clinton's statement. The second was a 2014 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, part of the federal reserve system. It predicts that the wealth owned by Hispanic families in total dollars will triple by 2025, although most of the extra wealth "would result from the Hispanic population growing faster than other groups" rather than individual Hispanics gaining more wealth. The report uses 2010 data (when Hispanics made up 16.3 percent of the United States population). The St. Louis Fed calculated that in 2010 Hispanics represented about 2.2 percent of the total wealth in the country. That's that 2 percent Clinton was referring to. At the time, median wealth for an Hispanic family was $15,000 versus $77,000 for the entire U.S. population. We sought newer data by turning to Pew, where Richard Fry, a senior economist, used 2013 household data collected by the Federal Reserve. "The nation’s total wealth was $64.7 trillion," he told us via email. "The nation’s 13 million Hispanic households owned about $1.5 trillion of that $64.7 trillion, so yes, Hispanic households owned about 2 percent of the nation’s wealth in 2013." The actual ratio: 2.3 percent. The current outlook for individual Hispanics is not very good. The Fed estimated that the Hispanic share of the economy's total wealth would rise by 2025 to either 2.6 percent or 3.2 percent, depending on the projection used. But that would be because the Hispanic population is growing significantly, not because individual families would be making a lot more money. "If it were not for the faster rate of population growth projected for the Hispanic population," the Fed concluded, "the wealth shares in 2025 would be 2.0 or 2.4 percent — that is, either a small decline or a small increase from their 2010 shares. Thus, relatively rapid population growth in the Hispanic population is likely to be an important contributor to the rising share of total wealth owned by Hispanics." Our ruling Clinton said, "Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth." Census Bureau data confirm the 17 percent. Federal reserve data from 2010 and more recent data from 2013 show that the 2 percent figure is on target as well. We rate the claim as True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c448ec66-9d95-4eb3-906d-850c41c3b4ee	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-09-19T11:31:28	2016-09-15	['None']
pomt-02278	"When people enter the service, there’s not a mental health evaluation."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/06/michael-mccaul/mccaul-when-people-enter-service-theres-not-mental/	The second shooting at the Texas military base Fort Hood in less than five years has reopened wounds -- and old debates. During the Sunday morning political shows on April 6, 2014, typical questions over base security and concealed carry rules on military installations emerged in the wake of the deadly shooting last week, with politicians and pundits mostly assuming their party-line positions. But there was some bipartisan consensus that the military should take a closer look at the mental health of enlisted service members. On Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said the effort should start at sign-up. "When people enlist in the military, there is a physical check but there's not a mental health evaluation when people enter the service," McCaul. "I think this will be a good idea to, No. 1, screen out individuals that may have mental illness problems. No. 2, have a baseline so that when they return home, we can compare that to where they are when they come back." We were unfamiliar with the process men and women go through to enlist and imagine McCaul’s claim about mental health evaluations caught the attention of viewers as well. So we decided to check it out. No formal process Officials have not yet identified a motive that caused Army Spec. Ivan A. Lopez to open fire at the Fort Hood base, killing three and injuring more than a dozen. Lopez was being treated for depression and was screened for post traumatic stress disorder, though Army officials have said mental health was "not the direct precipitating factor" in the shooting. McCaul’s office pointed us to legislation introduced by Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Penn. on March 27, 2014 -- coincidentally, just days before the shooting -- called the "Medical Evaluation Parity for Service Members Act." The bill would require a medical evaluation before an individual enlists in the armed forces. According to the legislation, "Although the military currently has a baseline measurement process for physical health, the military does not currently have similar standards for mental health." Speaking in favor of the bill, retired Army colonel and director of legislation for the National Guard Association of the United States Peter Duff said, "Not having a baseline is a neglectful disservice to our military members and veterans who risk their lives for our nation." The bill has the support from various military and veteran organizations, including Veterans of Foreign Wars, National Guard Association of the United States, Reserve Officers Association, Reserve Enlisted Association, Association of the U.S. Navy, National Military Family Association and Military Officers Association of America, as well as the American Psychological Association. A mental health examination is not listed in a description of the application procedure on the United State Military Entrance Processing Command website or in the Military Entrance Processing Station regulations. That’s all pretty strong evidence that no separate examination for identifying mental health disorders in enlistees exists, at least not in a similar form as the physical new recruits must go through. What does exist? But is there any evaluation the armed services conduct upfront? In addition to an aptitude test, as part of the initial screening, military officials review the medical records of potential service members for their mental health history. Col. Rebecca I. Porter, chief of the behavioral health division of the Office of the Army’s Surgeon General, told the Washington Post that the application process "includes a review of whatever medical records we have available, as well as asking potential soldiers to complete questionnaires where they might disclose information. We look for past diagnoses or past treatments, or other indicators of behavioral problems." Porter said a past suicide attempt, mood disorders like depression or bipolar disorders or drug abuse could all preclude someone from gaining admittance to one of the service branches. But much of that review requires the individual to have a documented medical history or to offer information that they may have problems. Such an admission would likely mean they would not be accepted. "People who want to come into the Army are no fools," Dr. Elspeth Ritchie, a former chief psychiatrist in the Army, told the Los Angeles Times. "They know if you say you had a past suicide attempt, you're probably not going to get in." A recent study from the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry conducted in consultation with the U.S. Army found 1 in 5 servicemembers had a mental health disorder before they even enlisted. Once enlisted, however, service members are prone to frequent mental health evaluations before and after deployment. "We have a series of evaluation of any soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman who's deployed prior to their deployment," Retired Lieutenant General Eric Schoomaker told NPR. "They have access to mental health and physical health care providers, as well, while they're on deployment. And when they return from deployment, within 30 days of their being redeployed, they have another series of examinations with the help of their small unit leader down-range, which is then married up with further assessments that take place when they hit the ground back at home station." Mental health evaluations can also be recommended by the overseeing officer. "If the chain of command becomes aware of a change in the soldier’s behavior, he can ask the soldier to be seen at a behavioral health clinic," Porter said in her Post interview. "Or if a commander had questions about a soldier’s fitness for duty, they could do a command-directed mental health evaluation, in which case a soldier is referred for evaluation with the understanding that the behavioral health provider will provide feedback to the commander." Not everyone in the military community agrees that a mental health evaluation upfront would be helpful. Schoomaker, a surgeon in the Army until 2012, recently told the Los Angeles Times that such a process "would just lead to driving the problems further underground." Our ruling McCaul said "there's not a mental health evaluation when people enter the service." Compared to the physical medical examination potential enlistees go through, there is no separate, specific examination of a recruit’s mental health. While the armed services review past medical records for a history of mental health issues and allow for the applicant to offer any additional information, it has not prevented a sizable number of individuals with mental health problems from acceptance. Lawmakers and military officials can debate what steps should or should not be taken, but we can’t find any flaw in McCaul’s characterization of the current procedures. We rate it True.

pomt-04276	Says U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson "says he’ll do away with Medicare."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/02/progressive-change-campaign-committee/progressive-group-says-thompson-says-hell-do-away-/	In a new TV ad by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Tommy Thompson stands starkly accused of pledging to "do away with Medicare." "I’ve been working in factories here in Wisconsin for 35 years," says a man standing in front of a plant gate. "This work is tough on us. You see a lot of folks with bad wrists, bad shoulders. When we’re ready to retire, we’ll need Medicare." He concludes: "Tommy Thompson has taken thousands of dollars from the insurance industry. Now he says he’ll do away with Medicare. I’m voting for Tammy Baldwin for Senate because she’ll never cut Medicare benefits." The liberal group’s TV spot dissolves into a video of Thompson speaking to a tea-party group in June 2012, and seemingly proves the group’s claim. "Who better than me to do away with Medicaid and Medicare?" Thompson asks in the ad. We are quite familiar with the video clip. The Journal Sentinel reported on it in June 2012. And Baldwin quoted Thompson’s statement from it while addressing a group of liberal bloggers. Now, as the tight Senate race draws to a close, the same clip is showing up in several anti-Thompson ads. In evaluating Baldwin’s claim in June, we found that Thompson did utter those words at a June 4, 2012, appearance before the Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty, an Oconomowoc-based group that decries excessive government and endorses "demolishing the growing, socialist ‘nanny state’ and its programs and legislation..." We also learned that’s only part of what Thompson said. For starters, the brief video clip in the Progressive Change ad is edited for effect. If you look closely, Thompson’s head jerks oddly during the "Who better than me…" statement. That’s because it’s spliced. Here’s the full quote: "Who better than me, (who’s) already finished one of the entitlement programs and come up with programs to do away with Medicaid and Medicare." In June, we rated Half True -- partially accurate -- Baldwin’s claim that Thompson "said" he wants to "do away with Medicare." When we asked the Progressive Change Campaign Committee to back up the ad’s claim, spokesman Neil Sroka said Thompson’s words were clear. Thompson was speaking candidly about his real view of Ryan’s plan, in front of a conservative group whose support he was seeking, Sroka said. Let’s take a fuller look, then, at Thompson’s June speech -- and see if anything has changed since our rating of the claim when Baldwin made it. At the tea-party event, Thompson prefaced the remarks in question by saying Medicare will be broke within a decade and the only way to save it is to give people who turn 55 starting in 2022 a choice of traditional Medicare or purchasing health insurance with a subsidy from the federal government. At that point, Thompson was fully endorsing U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s plan to reform Medicare, but recently he’s emphasized a plan that modestly modifies Ryan’s. As we noted on Nov. 2, 2012, in giving Thompson a Half Flip, he now wants to offer future seniors who don’t pick traditional Medicare the option of picking a private plan in the federal employees’ health program. In the tea-party speech, Thompson wrapped his argument for Medicare reform in the language of wiping it away and starting fresh. First, he harkened back to his days as Wisconsin governor, and his first-in-the-nation move to replace welfare with a work requirement. He told the audience the United States should "change Medicare and Medicaid like I did welfare." (We previously rated as Mostly True Thompson’s claim that he "ended welfare" in Wisconsin.) Then he said the line about who better than him to "come up with programs to do away with Medicaid and Medicare." It’s clear that Thompson was comfortable uttering the phrase "doing away with Medicare" in the middle of a recitation of his views on transforming the program. But there is another piece of background relevant to his views: Thompson didn’t say it at the event, but he told the Journal Sentinel in 2011 he firmly believes seniors will choose the private insurance option under Ryan’s plan instead of government-run care. Of government-run healthcare, he said he’s "always opposed" it. In his 2011 remarks, Thompson said government-run Medicare could disappear if people are allowed to opt out of it. At the same time, it’s clear that deeper into the June tea-party speech, after the statement in question, Thompson said he was interested in "saving" Medicare from fiscal extinction. He also framed his views as wanting to "change" Medicare, though in the context of his elimination of welfare in Wisconsin. Back in June, the Thompson campaign said it was not a misstatement by the candidate. Campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir offered this somewhat contradictory explanation: Thompson used the phrase "doing away with" in the context of "changing" Medicare, not eliminating it. In early October, after another liberal group used the tea-party video clip, Thompson told reporters: I am here to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security but you have to make some adjustments." So, where does that leave us? Same place as before. The PCCC ad leaves out important context from Thompson’s June remarks, just as Baldwin did. But Thompson did describe his reform plan, in that speech, as a way to "do away with" traditional Medicare. We rate it Half True.

pomt-09643	The Climatic Research Unit e-mails show that the science behind climate change "has been pretty well debunked."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/11/james-inhofe/inhofe-claims-cru-e-mails-debunk-science-behind-cl/	The newest tool in climate skeptics' arsenal: a series of hacked e-mails from the Climatic Research Unit, a branch of the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom. The correspondence, which was stolen from CRU's server sometime around Nov. 20, has some saying that the scientific underpinnings of climate change are false. When asked on Dec. 7, 2009, about the Environmental Protection Agency's recent announcement that it will now consider carbon dioxide a pollutant, a move that clears the way for stricter regulations of the greenhouse gas, longtime climate change critic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., had this to say on CNN's The Situation Room : "We see that that science [behind the announcement] has been pretty well debunked," he said referring to the e-mails. "I remember a long time ago ... I made a speech on the Senate floor where I talked about all these scientists coming in, talking about how they can't get their side on there and the science is all rigged. ... Sure enough, what is happening today in this whole debate is just what we said was happening four years ago." Specifically, Inhofe was talking about data that the EPA used to form its decision. It came from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific body that "reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical and socioeconomic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change." Thousands of scientists contribute data to the organization voluntarily, including scientists at CRU, the group whose e-mails were hacked. We've been following the complicated e-mail controversy for weeks, but there have been a number of issues that make fact-checking claims about the issue difficult. To start, the e-mails were obtained illegally, which raises questions about their validity. Some e-mails simply demonstrate a professional rivalry between scientists, a phenomenon that's nothing new to the profession. Scientists are disputing the meaning of some of the language in the e-mails. Finally, CRU has announced that it is conducting its own investigation into whether data were tossed out or otherwise manipulated unethically; that investigation is not complete. We do know that these e-mails clearly demonstrate some petty professional backstabbing and a degree of skepticism within the CRU circle about opinions that do not match their own. Read our story on the e-mail controversy . We also know this: The e-mails do not prove that climate change is a hoax. Here's why: Independent of CRU's data, agencies and academics all over the world are coming to essentially the same conclusion: Climate change is happening. Just take a recent report issued by the United States Global Research Program , an arm of the government that, since 1989, has been coordinating and integrating federal research on changes in the global environment and their implications for society. The report states that "global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced. ... Warming over this century is projected to be considerably greater than over the last century. The global average temperature since 1900 has risen by about 1.5ºF. By 2100, it is projected to rise another 2 to 11.5ºF." There are other ways to quantify these changes. NASA, for instance, tracks data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder to see how temperatures are affecting the arctic. The most recent data show that 2009 marks the third-lowest Arctic sea ice minimum on record. Similarly, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that sea levels over the past 100 years are rising at an average rate of 1.7 millimeters annually, "which is significantly larger than the rate averaged over the last several thousand years. Since 1993, global sea level has risen at an accelerating rate of around 3.5 mm/year. Much of the sea level rise to date is a result of increasing heat of the ocean causing it to expand." And here's an important point on NOAA's Web site: "A number of agencies around the world have produced datasets of global-scale changes in surface temperature using different techniques to process the data and remove measurement errors that could lead to false interpretations of temperature trends," the Web site says. "The warming trend that is apparent in all of the independent methods of calculating global temperature change is also confirmed by other independent observations, such as the melting of mountain glaciers on every continent, reductions in the extent of snow cover, earlier blooming of plants in spring, a shorter ice season on lakes and rivers, ocean heat content, reduced arctic sea ice, and rising sea levels." In short, temperatures are rising. So, to say that the CRU e-mails debunk the science supporting climate change leaves out the important point that CRU isn't the only organization looking at the issue. Indeed, there are reams of data that show temperatures are increasing and that greater concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are largely to blame. On this one, Inhofe is False.

That was conservative talk show host Sean Hannity’s point as he talked with a caller on his radio program on April 8, 2015. "You can’t build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia, did you know that?" Hannity said. A reader didn’t know that, and asked us to look into Hannity’s claim. It checks out. Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told us that while many Muslim countries allow churches, and synagogues for that matter, Saudi Arabia is unique. "I believe Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim country in which churches are prohibited," Hooper said. Akbar S. Ahmed is the chair of Islamic Studies at American University. He told PolitiFact in 2010 that there is nothing formalized in Islamic law that forbids the building of churches or synagogues. Saudi Arabia has a tradition of adopting the most restrictive interpretations of Islam. It is perhaps best known for its opposition to women driving cars. In 2008, representatives of the Vatican and Saudi Arabia held secret talks to clear the way for building a church in the Saudi kingdom. But the talks stalled. Christian bishops in Germany, Austria and Russia rebuked Saudi Arabia's top religious official in 2012 after reports that he issued a fatwa saying all churches on the Arabian Peninsula should be destroyed. According to Reuters, Saudi Arabia bans all non-Muslim houses of prayer. Christians there, typically foreign workers, pray in private homes. Our ruling Hannity said that Saudi Arabia doesn’t allow Christian churches. That’s correct. The Saudi Arabian government’s policy bans the construction of churches. Saudi Arabia is an outlier among predominantly Muslim countries. Hannity’s claim rates True.	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2015-04-09T15:58:05	2015-04-08	['Saudi_Arabia']
pomt-13362	Says Hillary Clinton "gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/30/donald-trump/nuclear-claim-donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-ga/	At a campaign rally in Waukesha, Wis., Donald Trump made a number of attacks on Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, including one involving Russia. Clinton "gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia -- to Russia," Trump said Sept. 28, 2016, two days after their first debate. "You know what people do with uranium, don’t you? It’s called nuclear. Twenty percent. They could have never done it without her." That's a more narrow, and less inflammatory, version of an attack that Trump made previously. But it still has problems. The uranium deal Before we get too far ahead of ourselves -- the United States gave a fifth of its uranium to Russia? What? Uranium is used to power commercial nuclear reactors that produce electricity and to produce isotopes used for medical, industrial and defense purposes around the world. As for the transaction Trump alluded to, it involved the Russian nuclear agency and Uranium One, a Toronto-based company. As PolitiFact National has reported, Russia’s nuclear energy agency, which also builds nuclear weapons, bought a controlling stake in Uranium One. The company has mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity. So, to be clear, the 20 percent is capacity, not uranium that has been produced. Given that Russia doesn’t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, it was likely more interested in Uranium One’s assets in Kazakhstan, the world’s largest uranium producer, our colleagues said. As the New York Times has reported, the deal was made in separate transactions from 2009 to 2013. It made Russia’s atomic energy agency one of the world’s largest uranium producers and brought Russian President Vladimir Putin "closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain." U.S. involvement So, what was Clinton’s role? Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies. At the time, the United States was seeking to "reset" its relationship with Russia and trying to get the Kremlin on board with its Iran nuclear deal. The national security issue at stake in the Uranium One deal was not primarily about nuclear weapons proliferation, the Times reported, because the United States and Russia had for years cooperated on that front, with Russia sending enriched fuel from decommissioned warheads to be used in American nuclear power plants in return for raw uranium. Instead, it concerned American dependence on foreign uranium sources. While the United States gets one-fifth of its electrical power from nuclear plants, it produces only around 20 percent of the uranium it needs. Trump’s claims Now, back to what Trump said. Trump’s previous claim on the topic, made in June 2016, was that Clinton’s State Department "approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation." PolitiFact National rated it Mostly False -- mainly because there is no evidence of a quid pro quo. As for Trump’s current claim, it’s overstated. The State Department did approve the Uranium One deal, but it didn’t act unilaterally. It was one of nine U.S. government agencies, plus independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal. And as FactCheck.org noted in a related fact check, while any of the nine agencies could have objected to the deal, only President Barack Obama had the power to veto it. Even then, the president can only prohibit such transactions only with "credible evidence" that the "foreign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security.’ Our rating Trump says Clinton "gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia." The reference is to Russia’s nuclear power agency buying a controlling interest in a Toronto-based company. That company has mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity (not produced uranium). Clinton was secretary of state at the time, but she didn’t have the power to approve or reject the deal. The State Department was only one of nine federal agencies that signed off on the deal, and only Obama had the power to veto it. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cbdc6c17-60c1-4ca0-b4e9-84c404095d12	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-30T07:55:00	2016-09-28	['Russia', 'United_States']
pomt-09438	"Individuals and small businesses will be hit by increases in health insurance premiums as high as 39 percent."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/11/americans-united-change/americans-united-change-says-health-insurance-prem/	Seeking support for health care reform, the liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change launched a phone campaign March 3 urging Americans to stand up to health insurance companies. The Washington-based group was formed in 2005 to challenge President George W. Bush’s efforts to privatize Social Security and has since broadened its scope to build public and congressional support for a variety of policy initiatives, including health care. Austin American-Statesman reporter Mary Ann Roser, who analyzed the call on her health blog, was one of 3.5 million voters nationwide who heard the recorded message: "I am calling from Americans United for Change. You’ve seen the news. Individuals and small businesses will be hit by increases in health insurance premiums as high as 39 percent. Insurance companies deny our claims, drop us when we’re sick and pay their CEOs huge bonuses. Now they want a 39 percent increase . . . Enough of this greed. It’s time to stand up to health insurance companies. Pass health care reform. Call Congress at 202-225-3121." We looked at whether premiums are increasing nearly 40 percent for individuals and small businesses — and whether the robocall's ominous warning is warranted. The group's communications director, Jeremy Funk, pointed us to a report by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services admonishing Anthem Blue Cross, the California affiliate of insurer WellPoint Inc, for plans to raise its premiums. Earlier, Anthem notified about 800,000 customers who buy individual insurance policies that their premiums would go up as much as 39 percent on March 1. At the request of the California Department of Insurance, WellPoint postponed the premium hikes until May 1 to allow the department additional time for review. WellPoint said: "Our decision to agree to postpone the rate adjustment does not change the underlying issue. All health plans are in the same situation in trying to deal with the steadily increasing medical costs in the delivery system, which are not sustainable." The HHS report cites companies that requested permission to raise health insurance premiums in five states last year, proposing increases of 16 percent to 56 percent. They didn't necessarily succeed. Anthem of Maine requested an 18.5 percent increase; that state allowed 10.9 percent. In Michigan, Blue Cross Blue Shield raised rates 22 percent after requesting premium increases of 56 percent for some policyholders. And this year, insurers in Massachusetts asked for premium hikes of 8 to 32 percent. Most states regulate what companies charge their residents for health insurance. But in Texas, the majority of life, accident and health insurance rate hikes are never filed with the Texas Department of Insurance, according to the Texas Sunset Commission. Except for Medicare supplemental insurance, no prior state approval is needed to increase health insurance premiums. However, health insurers are required to file rate increases that affect people who buy their own health insurance — about 4 percent of all Texans — but the filing is mostly for informational, not regulatory purposes. Most everyone else is either uninsured or covered by Medicaid, Medicare or employer-provided health insurance, none of which the state regulates. State law holds that insurance rates in Texas must be just, fair, reasonable, adequate, not confiscatory, not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory. The department can contest rates for individual plans that don't comply, according to John Greeley, a public information officer at the department. So far it hasn't. So how do Texas rates stack up for individuals and small businesses, per the focus of Americans for United Change's claim? Katrina Daniel, senior associate commissioner at the state insurance department, said Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas filed 60 rate increases for individual policyholders from January to October 2009 ranging from 3 percent to 25 percent. UniCare filed increases up to 11 percent. Since the state doesn't regulate employer-sponsored insurance, we went looking for some specific examples. Tom Banning, CEO of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians, said Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas raised premiums 21 percent to provide coverage for the organization's 12-member staff. And Lydia Hegl, vice president at insurance brokerage firm Texas Benefit Solutions, said she's seen premium hikes from 10 to 30 percent for small groups, meaning companies with less than 50 employees. On the Texas Association of Health Underwriters Cafe, an e-mail forum that "allows agents, brokers and carrier to discuss topics ranging from, "How do I...?", to legislative issues that affect the future of health care," we found people discussing premium increases from 15 to 58 percent. Michael Lee, an agent at MLee Insurance, writes: "Every (customer) renewal I have had this year through April are running 30 percent to 40 percent. Even groups that are young healthy males. Am I just getting this preferred treatment or is anyone else seeing this?" From that testimony, it looks like at least some Texans will be paying higher premiums, comparable to the 39 percent increase cited by Americans for United Change. But what about the implicit message of the organization's robocall: That the health care changes sought by President Obama will prevent such rate hikes? On Nov. 30, the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress that analyzes legislation, estimated that under the Senate's version of the health reform plan, most people's premiums will stay the same or decrease slightly by 2016 — especially for the 46 percent of Texans who are insured through their work. Most people who buy their own insurance would be eligible for federal subsidies that would make their premiums drop by more than half. A smaller percentage of the self-insured would see their rates increase 10 to 13 percent, but they would be getting better coverage. And Drew Altman, president and CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy, said: "In President Obama’s recent health care proposal, he notably improves on the affordability of the Senate health care bill, both in terms of premiums and out-of-pocket costs." The Urban Institute, another nonpartisan research group, projects that if federal reform efforts fail, individual and family out-of-pocket costs could go up nationwide by more than 35 percent through 2019. In Texas, the institute says, individual and family spending would increase even more — about 58 percent in a best-case scenario, and 80 percent worst-case. Summing up: Unless the state of California deems Anthem's rate hikes unjustified, thousands of individual policyholders will face premium increases as high as 39 percent. Folks in other states — including Texas — also are experiencing hikes in the double-digits. Meantime, the CBO projects that most Americans' premiums would decrease under the Senate's health care plan. A tiny minority of individuals who buy their own insurance would pay 10 to 13 percent more, while receiving better coverage. Of course, all these numbers are just projections and the outcome of the debate over health care reform is uncertain. But given what's known at this point, United Americans for Change's robocall message rings Mostly True.	None	Americans United for Change	None	None	None	2010-03-11T17:29:42	2010-03-03	['None']
pomt-04277	Says U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin "proposed a $3.9 trillion tax increase -- a tax increase so extreme" that "even Nancy Pelosi voted against it."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/02/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-group-says-tammy-baldwin-proposed-39-trillion-/	In their efforts to lift Tommy Thompson to victory over U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, Republicans have tied Baldwin to a Democratic lightning rod, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. "You already know how extreme Tammy Baldwin is," begins a TV ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee released Oct. 15, 2012. The ad goes on to make a number of claims, including this one: "Baldwin even proposed a $3.9 trillion tax increase -- a tax increase so extreme, so destructive, even Nancy Pelosi voted against it." The group, which helps elect Republicans to the U.S. Senate, made the same claim in another TV ad released two weeks later. Let’s check the record. Thompson, the Republican former governor, portrayed Baldwin as on the political fringe even before he entered the Senate race. In September 2011, we rated as Mostly True his claim that the Madison Democrat ranks as the most liberal member of the House. Based on votes she cast, three major rankings put Baldwin among a group of House members considered the most liberal. We’ve already examined the proposed tax increase cited in the Republican committee’s ad. It was part of a 2012 federal budget proposal made by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which consists of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, and 75 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Baldwin is a vice-chair of the group; Pelosi is not a member. Thompson said the caucus’ budget proposal -- an alternative to plans submitted by President Barack Obama and House Republicans -- would have spent trillions of dollars more than Obama’s budget. We rated the claim False because the caucus budget would have spent less over 10 years than Obama’s budget. But we pointed out that, according to experts, total tax collections under the caucus plan would have been some $5 trillion higher than under the Obama budget. In an April 2011 vote, the caucus budget failed in the House, 347-77. Baldwin voted for it; Pelosi, the House minority leader at the time, was among 108 Democrats and 239 Republicans who voted against it. The TV ad doesn’t cite any reasons and the GOP committee didn’t reply to our requests for more information. We checked a transcript of the debate on the House floor about the Progressive Caucus budget proposal and it indicates Pelosi didn’t speak. We also checked the collection of news releases on Pelosi’s House website. We found she spoke on the House floor about the Republican budget proposal, but not about the Progressive Caucus budget. Our rating The National Republican Senatorial Committee said Baldwin "proposed a $3.9 trillion tax increase -- a tax increase so extreme" that "even Nancy Pelosi voted against it." Baldwin backed a budget that included a $3.9 trillion tax increase. Pelosi voted against the budget and its tax increase, although her reasons aren’t clear. We rate the claim Mostly True. Note: On Oct. 31, 2017, we edited this item to make it clear that experts had told us that tax collections would be $5 trillion higher in the caucus budget than in the Obama budget, not that the caucus budget would have raised taxes by $5 trillion more.

pomt-04918	President Obama has "added $4 billion in debt every day."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/01/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-pins-4-billion-day-debt-obama/	Set to sorrowful music, a new ad from Crossroads GPS reels off a bunch of depressing claims about the economy. Here’s part of the script: "It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Over three years with crushing unemployment. American manufacturing shrinking again. President (Barack) Obama’s plan: Spend more. He’s added $4 billion in debt every day. The economy is slowing but our debt keeps growing. Tell him for real job growth cut the debt." Crossroads GPS is a conservative advocacy group; its ad has aired in Florida and other swing states. That $4 billion in debt a day figure sounds pretty massive. We wanted to check if it was that high and if Obama is to blame. A spokesman for Crossroads GPS pointed us to the total debt figure as of July 5 -- about a week before the ad launched -- so we will use that date as our starting point. There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $11 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.8 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, and other funds and accounts. To see how fast the public debt is growing, we looked at the total on two dates. On Jan. 20, 2009 -- the day Obama was sworn in as president -- the total debt was about $10.6 trillion and rose to about $15.9 trillion by July 5. The amount of time between those two dates was 1,262 days. That works out to about $4.16 billion a day. We agree with the math. But is Obama solely to blame here? Measuring blame We contacted a few experts on the federal budget: Jason Peuquet of the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan public policy think-tank; J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation, Gary Burtless of the centrist Brookings Institution and Joshua Gordon of the Concord Coalition which advocates reducing the debt. No one placed the blame entirely on Obama. The rising debt stems from several factors, including the 2009 stimulus and expansions of TARP, and the economic downturn that led to falling employment and wages and more spending on programs linked to poverty and unemployment, Peuquet said. "Blame for the economic downturn can go toward many people, political parties, institutions, lenders, borrowers, and economic uncontrollables, etc. And it’s not just the president who was responsible for the legislative initiatives either – he had to work with Congress on those," Peuquet told PolitiFact. Both parties share in the blame for the debt that is set to rise down the road as result of enacting expansions in entitlement programs and tax cuts, and for failing to reach an agreement on how to control rising debt. The economic downturn explains most of the new debt and that began before Obama took office, Gordon said. The tax cuts that have lowered revenue and increased deficits over the last three years have had bipartisan support, as have nearly every spending bill over the last two years. "So, it is impossible to attribute the debt to any single politician or party," Gordon told PolitiFact. "Furthermore, the increase in debt tells you nothing about what legislative proposals by the candidates would do in the future -- and it is the future debt growth that matters most." Burtless said that most of the debt added under Obama would have happened even if he followed the tax and spending policies in effect when he took office. But Obama embraced policies that increased the public debt -- including signing the stimulus package and agreeing to other measures that held down taxes and increased unemployment benefits. "However, I believe the overwhelming share of extra public debt accumulated since Jan. 2009 would also have been accumulated even if none of those new policies had been proposed or adopted," Burtless said. "The reason is straightforward. The Bush administration was committed to a certain level of spending (for defense, non-defense discretionary, and mandatory non-defense programs) and to a particular schedule of income and payroll taxes. Those policies, if maintained by President Obama, would have produced sizeable annual deficits – deficits nearly as large as the ones we actually saw." But Obama is not off the hook here. "Was not deficit spending the core feature of his economic stimulus plan? Has he objected to it in any way? Has he proposed changes in fiscal policy that would have materially altered the course? Each answer is obvious, and each leads to the same conclusion -- it is perfectly fair to argue that Obama is responsible for this debt increase," Foster told PolitiFact. "Did he sign every bill that produced the debt? Of course not. But is it entirely consistent with his policy." Our ruling Crossroads GPS has its math correct what it says that Obama has "added $4 billion in debt every day." But the ad suggests that Obama is solely to blame. That’s not true, because other factors -- including the struggling economy he inherited and decisions made before he took office -- contributed to that debt. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11256	Florida’s "unemployment is at a record low."	false	/florida/statements/2018/may/01/us-chamber-commerce/unemployment-record-low-under-florida-gov-rick-sco/	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s economic achievements in an ad supporting his bid for U.S. Senate against Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. The 30-second ad knocks Nelson for voting against the 2017 tax cut bill while highlighting Scott’s efforts to cut taxes ("40 times!") and create jobs. "Scott has cut red tape for better innovation, and our unemployment is at a record low," speakers say in the ad. At 3.9 percent in March, Florida’s unemployment rate is at its lowest point since before Scott took office. But it is not at an all-time low. The unemployment rate has been lower several times since 1976, right up to the burst of the housing bubble in 2007. The ad cites a March Washington Examiner story. Headlined, "Four states hit record low unemployment in February," the article singles out California, Maine, Mississippi and Wisconsin as reaching record-low unemployment rates. The story discussed Florida, the third-largest state, with a more qualified point: "It's not just small states. Texas is near record-low unemployment. Florida unemployment, at 3.9 percent, is near as low as it's ever been outside the years of the housing bubble." We turned to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to get a better understanding of Florida’s unemployment history. Florida’s unemployment rate has held at 3.9 percent since September 2017 through March 2018, the latest month for which we have data. We confirmed that Florida’s unemployment rate has been lower than or equal to 3.9 percent several times in the last 20 years. We counted 43 months from 1998 to 2018 with unemployment rates below 3.9 percent. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In late 1999 and early 2000, Florida’s unemployment was between 3.7 to 3.9 percent, based on seasonally adjusted data. From 2005 to 2007, Florida’s unemployment rate wavered between 3.1 to 3.9 percent. The rate climbed to a peak of 11.3 percent in January 2010 before falling during the years of the national economic recovery. Our ruling A U.S. Chamber of Commerce ad said Florida’s unemployment is at a record low. The rate is the lowest since April 2007, but it is not a record low. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the unemployment rate was lower multiple times between 1999 and 2007. We rate this claim False.

The U.S. Senate candidates relentlessly attacked the other’s presidential party nominee at the U.S. Senate debate Oct. 17 in Orlando. After Murphy explained to the audience why he supports Clinton, Rubio fired back with an unsubstantiated claim about U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. "If Congressman Murphy trusts Hillary Clinton 100 percent, he’s in rare company, because not even Tim Kaine is willing to say that," Rubio said, "and he’s her running mate." His line got a few laughs, but a quick search of articles and transcripts refutes his point. ‘I trust Hillary Clinton with our son’s life’ Kaine accepted his party’s nomination to be vice president on July 27 during the Democratic National Convention, less than a week after Clinton announced him as her choice. In his speech, the Virginia senator and former Virginia governor vouched for Clinton’s character and urged voters to trust her. "Hey, last week, last week in Cleveland we heard a lot about trust," Kaine said, referring to the Republican National Convention. "So let’s talk about trust. Let’s talk about trust. I want to tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton." Kaine pointed to Clinton’s longtime work helping kids and families through her work on the Children’s Defense Fund, and added, "And on a personal level, as (Nat) is serving our nation abroad, I trust Hillary Clinton with our son’s life." Kaine reiterated his trust more recently during the first question of the vice presidential debate on Oct. 7 about why he would be qualified to fill the position of president if need be. "We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life," Kaine said. "We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander in chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander in chief scares us to death." With all of this talk about trust, we wondered what Rubio was talking about. His campaign sent PolitiFact Florida a news release exploring Kaine’s comments regarding Clinton’s trustworthiness, pointing to Kaine’s interview ABC’s The View in October. "During an appearance on The View, Tim Kaine would not say that Hillary Clinton is trustworthy when asked about ‘voters that have doubted her on the trust issues,’ reads the release. Watch the clip for yourself. After we did, we found the press release was misleading — and Rubio’s interpretation was even more over the top. Kaine doesn’t say he trusts Clinton, but he’s never explicitly asked if he does. He is probed about the internal emails released by Wikileaks, and how findings that Clinton might have received debate questions ahead of time affect the campaign, especially since Clinton has struggled with trust among voters. "And we've seen that one of the issues that she's struggled with is this issue of trust. Does this support that?" The View co-host Jedediah Bila asked Kaine. "Or what do you say to voters that have doubted her on the trust issues and now see these things coming through via Wikileaks?" Kaine told the audience that the Russian government was behind the Wikileaks, adding that "you can't automatically assume that everything in all of these documents are even real." He then went on to defend Clinton’s character, referencing her fight for health insurance for low-income children. "Hillary Clinton has a passion from the time she was a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago," Kaine said. "Under the influence of this great guy named Don Jones, her passion has been empowering families and kids." Our ruling Rubio said that "not even Tim Kaine" is willing to say that he trusts Hillary Clinton. This is wrong. Kaine has vocalized his trust of Clinton on multiple occasions, and there is no evidence suggesting Kaine doesn’t feel this way. Rubio’s statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-04470	"Congressman Cicilline, when he was the mayor of Providence, espoused a sanctuary city."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/09/brendan-doherty/brendan-doherty-says-us-rep-david-cicilline-provid/	Between trading shots about bowling and who was more trustworthy during "10 News Conference," on WJAR on Sept. 30, 2012, Republican Brendan Doherty and incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. David Cicilline had a pointed exchange on immigration policy. As Cicilline, Doherty and independent David Vogel were talking about the implications of federal immigration policy, Doherty interjected: "Congressman Cicilline, when he was the mayor of Providence, espoused a sanctuary city." Cicilline responded instantly. "That’s absolutely not true! Mr. Doherty, and you know that," he said. "That is not true and you know that." Well, we don’t know what Doherty knew, but we wondered whether Cicilline had ever espoused Providence as a sanctuary city. The term "sanctuary city" generally means a municipality that has decided not to enforce federal immigration laws or cooperate with the federal government in enforcing them. In New Haven, Conn., for example, the city issues identification cards to residents regardless of their federal immigration status. In San Francisco, the city and county passed ordinances that say no city or county employee or resources can be used "to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration law or to gather or disseminate information regarding the immigration status of individuals in the City and County of San Francisco" unless such assistance is required by federal or state law or a court decision. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice was concerned enough to conduct an audit to see whether any state or local government that received more than $1 million from the Department of Homeland Security was failing to enforce federal immigration law. The 2007 survey found that San Francisco and the state of Oregon had declared themselves sanctuaries and the mayor of New York City had issued an executive order limiting how local police could enforce immigration law. But even in a case as extreme at San Francisco’s, the department said they operated within the law. Doherty said he based his statement on his experiences as commander of the Rhode Island State Police during the summer of 2008. Cicilline was Providence mayor at the time and Doherty’s boss, Governor Donald Carcieri, had called on local police departments to check the immigration status of people they arrested or investigated. Then-Providence Police Chief Dean Esserman -- now the chief in New Haven -- balked. The department would check the status of arrestees, but would not check unarrested individuals without cause because his department depended on the trust of the city’s immigrant population and doing so could jeopardize that trust. The difference of opinion became an issue in July 2008, after a Guatemalan man in the country illegally kidnapped a woman in Warwick, took her to Roger Williams Park and raped her. The man had been previously ordered deported by an immigration judge, but Providence police had picked him up on a misdemeanor before the rape and released him. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) blamed the Providence police for missing the deportation order, saying the locals should have contacted ICE’s Vermont office after they arrested the man on the misdemeanor charge. The Providence police said they’d found nothing when they checked a national arrest warrant database and had faxed a copy of the man’s arraignment sheet to ICE but got no response. Carcieri harshly criticized Providence’s position. Doherty said it was his impression, after discussing the issue with Esserman, that Providence was intending to become a sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants. Cicilline shot back, in news releases and interviews. "The governor’s assertion that Providence is a ‘sanctuary city’ is wrong," Cicilline wrote in a July 16, 2008, Providence Journal commentary. "A single member of the City Council proposed the idea, which I opposed, and it was never even voted on by the council." Our ruling Brendan Doherty said David Cicilline "espoused Providence as a sanctuary city." But he offered no evidence that Cicilline had ever supported such a position. In fact, when others suggested Providence was a sanctuary city, Cicilline aggressively disputed it. Unlike San Francisco and New Haven, no governing body in Providence ever declared a policy of non-cooperation with the federal government on immigration issues. When the idea was proposed by a City Council member, Cicilline opposed it and it never even got to a council vote. Cicilline never issued an order to any departments to that effect. We find Doherty’s statement False.	None	Brendan Doherty	None	None	None	2012-10-09T00:01:00	2012-09-30	['None']
pomt-08904	The president's budget "would take ... non-defense spending to its lowest level ... as a percentage of the economy since JFK."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-his-budget-would-lower-non-defen/	At a July 22, 2010, ceremony to sign the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act, President Barack Obama took the opportunity to tout his administration's approach to reining in federal spending. "We’ve drafted a budget for next year that freezes all discretionary government spending outside of national security for three years, a budget, by the way, that would reduce this spending -- non-defense discretionary spending -- to its lowest level as a share of the economy in 50 years," Obama said. "This isn’t talked about a lot, so I’m going to repeat it. Our budget would take non-security defense -- or non-defense spending to its lowest level since JFK -- lowest level as a percentage of the economy since JFK." If you look past his verbal false starts, we think there's a fact worth checking here -- that his budget "would take ... non-defense spending to its lowest level ... as a percentage of the economy since JFK." We first turned to the president's own budget blueprint for fiscal year 2011, released in February 2010. Among the document's historical tables is one -- for budget wonks, it's Table 8.4 -- that includes a column for non-defense, discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP all the way back to 1962. This table shows non-defense, discretionary spending at 4.1 percent of GDP for fiscal year 2009 (the most recent completed year), at an estimated 4.7 percent for fiscal year 2010 and an estimated 4.4 percent for fiscal year 2011. From that point, the estimated percentage falls steadily from 3.9 percent in 2012 to 3.3 in 2015. How does that compare historically? The current numbers are actually high by historical standards; the percentage was lower than 4.1 in every single year between 1984 and 2008, and it was also lower than 4.1 percent in eight additional years going back to 1962. The lowest future projected percentage -- 3.3 in 2015 -- is close to the lowest since 1962, but not quite the lowest. So the president is close -- but not quite correct -- by these numbers. However, that's not the end of the story. Experts also pointed us to longer-term projections published in OMB's Mid-Session Review, released July 23, 2010. In Table S-5 ("Proposed Budget by Category as a Percent of GDP"), the line that summarizes "non-security" discretionary spending starts at 3.1 percent of GDP for 2009, rises to 3.6 percent for 2010, falls slightly to 3.5 percent for 2011, before declining steadily from 3.0 percent in 2012 to 2.2 in 2019 and 2020. So by this measurement, it's clear that the Obama Administration does intend to reduce non-security discretionary spending to 3.0 percent of GDP by 2012 and to 2.2 percent by 2019. That's a reduction of its current percentage by one-fifth in the span of two years and about two-fifths in the span of nine years. We need to point out that this category is called "non-security" discretionary spending. That's different than the term "non-defense" spending that's used in the President's Budget. At the risk of getting too far into the weeds, a number of programs count as "non-defense" in the President's Budget but as "security" in the Mid-Session Review, including the Department of Homeland Security, portions of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of State and other international programs. So while the two statistics are similar -- defense programs account for about 80 percent of the total -- it's enough to distort the percentages in the two reports so that they are not directly comparable. When we asked the administration for a table that made an apples-to-apples comparison, they sent us one. This chart mirrors the one from the Mid-Session review, going down to 2.2 percent in 2019 and 2020. 3.2 percent recorded in 1999 stands as the record low in this calculation.It also shows the comparable figures in the Kennedy Administration as 2.2 percent in 1962 and 2.4 percent in 1963. So by these figures, Obama is right. But we should add a caveat -- that the president's budget is a statement of his intentions, not a mandate, and as such should be taken with a grain of salt. "What will he require Congress to do in 2011?" asked J.D. Foster, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation. "If they spend more than his budget, will he veto the bills? If they pass 'emergency' measures one after another, will he force them to offset the spending with other spending cuts? If he waves higher spending through every time, his budget becomes nothing more than a propoganda document." Indeed, Foster added that non-defense, discretionary spending has historically been in the upper 3 percent range. "Exactly what cuts is he suggesting to get spending so low?" he asked. "Slashing education? Transportation? Health care research? And why does he think Congress would agree to them?" In fact, the lowest levels of projected non-defense, discretionary spending under the Obama budget would kick in for fiscal year 2019, when he will be long out of office -- even if he wins a second term. But it does fall to lowest-since-JFK levels -- 2.5 percent -- by 2014, which would be during Obama's second term should he win one. Ultimately, we do think that Obama was careful not to over-sell his point. He said that his budget "would reduce ... non-defense discretionary spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy in 50 years." That's more cautious than saying it "will reduce" such spending to a record-low level. But we think it's essential to keep in mind that these are the president's intentions -- not firm data. For that reason, we knock it down a notch to Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-07-29T14:22:30	2010-07-22	['None']
pomt-00635	As a senator, Hillary Clinton "actually paid female staffers a lot less than men."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/21/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-senator-hillary-clinton-paid-female-s/	Is Hillary Clinton a hypocrite when it comes to equal pay? That’s the question raised by some conservative commentators after a Washington Free Beacon story said Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents for every dollar earned by a male counterpart. As Fox News host Sean Hannity put it: "As senator, she actually paid female staffers a lot less than the men." Hannity’s guests, Democratic contributor Tamara Holder and former Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes, debated the story. Holder said the Free Beacon story was based on manipulated data. McInnes said the bigger picture was that women earn less in America because "they choose to" attend kids’ piano recitals and not work late. We’ll set McInnes’ statement aside and focus on the attack against Clinton, the 2016 Democratic frontrunner. The Free Beacon story The Washington Free Beacon article headlined "Hillary Clinton’s War on Women" looked at data from Senate expenditure reports submitted to the secretary of the Senate from 2002-08. (The reports are not available online for Clinton’s time in office, but we found the information published at Legistorm.) The website focused on full-time staffers who worked a complete fiscal year, which runs Oct. 1-Sept. 30. Clinton was sworn in as New York’s junior senator in January 2001, so the Free Beacon analysis does not include her first nine months in office. The Free Beacon analysis also excludes Senate employees who took leaves of absence, which is common for employees who leave for short periods to work on campaigns, or left after even 11 months of work within the fiscal year. Regardless, the Free Beacon concluded the median salary for a woman on Clinton’s payroll was about $15,700 less than the median salary for the men of the office, or about $40,800 compared to $56,500 for men. "The salaries speak for themselves," the story says. "The data shows that women in her office were paid 72 cents for every dollar paid to men." Clinton campaign responds A Buzzfeed News headline on the same topic presents a completely different take: "Internal Data: Hillary Clinton Paid Women And Men Equally." What’s going on here? The Clinton campaign provided salary data for full-time staffers that worked in the Senate office as well as what they earned if they worked for a congressional committee or political groups Friends of Hillary, Hill PAC, and Hillary Clinton for President. The information showed names, positions and salaries for Senate staffers, Senate committees and applicable political activity from 2002-08. The data show a median salary of $40,000 for both men and women receiving official Senate pay over those seven years (excluding Clinton’s pay, since she does not pay herself). The median salary remains equal if you factor in non-Senate work, too. The campaign argues this is a better picture of a staffer’s annual earnings, as some staffers took time away from official duties to join in Clinton’s presidential campaign efforts in 2007 and 2008. Huma Abedin, for example, earned $20,000 in 2008 as a senior adviser on Clinton’s Senate staff, but she also made $150,000 working on the campaign that year, too. "The Free Beacon based their analysis on an incomplete, and therefore, inaccurate set of numbers," Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said. "The fact is, Hillary Clinton paid full-time men and women equally." If you isolate the data from year to year, the median earnings between men and women were not so even. In 2002, female Senate staffers (excluding Clinton) earned a median of $33,000, while men earned $42,500. The median pay gap closed in 2005 to $41,000 for women and $43,000 for men, and then women exceeded the men’s pay in 2006 and 2007. For what it’s worth, there were more women working for Clinton overall than men in every year. Not doing the same work The fact is neither set of data provides a truly definitive answer to the following question: Did Hillary Clinton pay men and women equally? Neither set of data compares wages for men and women who do the same work, which is the key issue in claims about the wage gap. PunditFact ran into a similar issue when Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett Packard executive running for the Republican presidential nomination, accused President Barack Obama of not paying men and women equally. She said Obama was "not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House." Fiorina’s claim rated Mostly False because she was using a misleading measure. In reality, politicians and pundits of all stripes have abused data about the gender pay gap. Democrats often fall into trouble by suggesting women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men for doing the same work. In reality, women and men often choose to do different work, and those choices impact pay as much or more than gender. In this case, the Free Beacon and Hannity are overlooking data gaps and the individual circumstances of life working in the U.S. Senate. There are more significant differences between the methodologies of the Clinton campaign and the Free Beacon. Unlike the Free Beacon, the campaign includes staffers who worked full-time but not for the entire year. Our friends at FactCheck.org, which also looked at this topic, points out that an assistant chief of staff, Dan Schwerin, earned a $35,000 salary, but he was not included in the Free Beacon’s analysis because he took a two-week unpaid leave of absence to work on a House campaign. Norman Ornstein, a scholar of congressional pay at the American Enterprise Institute, said it’s common for Senate staffers to temporarily leave payrolls to volunteer or work for campaigns and political committees. So he favors the Clinton campaign’s approach. Making apples-to-apples comparisons is difficult, he said, "but it is clear that the Free Beacon approach did not take into account the reality that people move in and out of payrolls on a fairly regular basis." Another wrinkle for the Free Beacon analysis: Legistorm, the nonprofit that records salaries in Congress, cautions users from extrapolating exact salary information from the twice-yearly reports from offices that it shares, pointing out in its FAQ that true earnings fluctuate depending on bonuses and leaves of absence to work on the political side. Our ruling Hannity said Hillary Clinton paid "paid female staffers a lot less than the men" than when she was a senator. One set of data supports that claim, but it is far from perfect. There are several ways of looking at Senate earnings — one created by the Clinton campaign, for instance, undercuts Hannity’s claim. In reality, all the datasets have caveats. While it’s fair to note that Democrats can overreach on gender pay claims by using imperfect data, it doesn’t mean critics can use the same imperfect data to make counterclaims. Hannity’s claim includes an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-06216	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is making voting more difficult by closing Department of Motor Vehicles offices where "low-income voters" live.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/07/chris-bowers/daily-kos-says-possible-recall-looming-wisconsin-g/	The liberal blog Daily Kos describes itself as a national political "news organization, community and activist hub" -- in other words, it doesn’t just cover politics, it engages in it. Indeed, like a candidate or political organization, Daily Kos employs a campaign director, Chris Bowers. On Nov. 30, 2011, Bowers appeared on "The Big Picture," a political talk show produced by RT, a network carried by cable and satellite TV providers. Bowers and the host, liberal commentator Thom Hartmann, discussed the campaign launched earlier that month to recall Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. They also talked about how Wisconsin’s new voter photo identification law -- which requires a photo ID for nearly all voters -- might affect a recall election, should one be held in 2012. Bowers said many Wisconsin residents don't know about the law -- "especially low-income voters in urban areas where, not only do they now have to have an ID in order to vote, Department of Motor Vehicles (offices) in these areas are being closed down at the same time." Republicans say photo ID ensures integrity at the ballot box, while Democrats say the law will discourage low-income residents and others who typically back Democrats from voting. But is Walker really shutting down DMV offices -- places where many people would go to get a photo ID -- in low-income areas? In a September 2011 item-- in which we rated Pants on Fire a claim by the Democratic Governors Association that Walker was denying Democrats the right to vote -- we noted Walker had dropped a plan to close DMV offices. Walker had faced pressure from lawmakers and citizens to shelve the plan. So, we wondered if something had changed that would have led the Bowers to say Walker was closing DMV offices in low-income urban areas. We asked Bowers, who simply replied in an email: "I misspoke." Without question. Our conclusion Bowers claimed Walker is closing Department of Motor Vehicles offices in urban areas of Wisconsin where "low-income voters" live. A plan to close DMV offices had been dropped two months earlier, however, and Daily Kos’ campaign director admitted he had spoken in error. We rate the statement False. (Editor's note: In this item, we originally attributed the statement to the Daily Kos organization. Publisher Markos Moulitsas told us Bowers was speaking for himself, not the organization. So we have changed the source of the statement to reflect that.)	None	Chris Bowers	None	None	None	2011-12-07T09:00:00	2011-11-30	['Scott_Walker_(politician)', 'Wisconsin']
pomt-14709	Says Missouri needs a voter I.D. law because "there’s over 16 people in the state of Missouri who have been convicted of some type of voter fraud."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2016/jan/04/will-kraus/numbers-dont-support-will-kraus-statement-voter-fr/	For nearly a decade, Missouri Republicans have pushed to require a photo I.D. to vote. Those efforts have all fallen short — either in the General Assembly, at the governor’s desk or in the courts. In the upcoming legislative session, lawmakers will try again. Their 2016 plan is a referendum on amending the Missouri Constitution to give the Secretary of State, whose office oversees elections, the power to require that would-be voters present government-issued photo identification. Along with the amendment, lawmakers are pushing a bill that would write photo ID requirements into law. Both measures were pre-filed Dec. 1 by Sen. Will Kraus, R-Lee’s Summit. Kraus has pushed similar measures in past legislative sessions, and next year he will be on the ballot for Secretary of State. He says there are lots of things that already require a photo I.D., like driving a car or opening a bank account, and that voting should be among them. He’s also presented it as a solution to voter fraud. Speaking on the Aug. 30 episode of This Week in Missouri Politics, Kraus said: "There’s over 16 people in the state of Missouri who have been convicted of some type of voter fraud. That shows people in the state of Missouri are trying to cheat elections." That combination of specificity and vagueness piqued our interest. Court cases Kraus didn’t give a timeframe for his statement. When reached for comment, his campaign emailed a report from the Heritage Foundation that pointed to 17 convictions since 2005. But none of the cases involved voter impersonation, which is what voter I.D. laws are designed to combat. Instead, all 17 were convicted on false voter registrations. Registering to vote doesn’t require a photo I.D.; it can be done by mail. And Kraus’ proposed amendment only applies to "a voter seeking to vote in person," according to the bill summary. So none of those 17 cases would’ve been averted by his proposals. Moreover, not every person in the Heritage report was convicted of an election offense, per se. For instance, the document highlights the case of Nonaresa Montgomery, who was accused in 2001 of registering fake voters in St. Louis before the mayoral election. Election workers realized that among the names Montgomery submitted was an alderman who had been dead for about a decade, and the fake registrations never made it onto city rolls. Six volunteer activists pleaded guilty to election violations, but Montgomery wasn’t among them. Instead, she was found guilty of perjury for lying to a grand jury about being able to track the registration cards the volunteers had given her. Voter Impersonation The Secretary of State’s office runs an elections integrity unit whose job is to monitor irregularities. Laura Swinford, who was the Secretary of State’s spokeswoman until November, said that unit hasn’t handled any cases of voter impersonation fraud. "We don’t have reported cases of voter fraud. We just don’t," she said in October. "The reality is there hasn’t been a documented case" of voter impersonation, said Stephanie Fleming, who replaced Swinford as the Secretary of State’s spokeswoman. Swinford, who now is executive director of Progress Missouri, said the Secretary of State’s office recently encountered fraudulent signatures on petitions, but "the reason we know that is the system is working." Counties aren’t required to report cases of election irregularities to the Secretary of State’s office, although they typically do, so it’s difficult to definitively say zero cases of voter impersonation have occurred, she said. But it’s rare enough to conclude voter impersonation isn’t a problem in Missouri, she said. "I can’t prove there’s no bigfoot. There’s just no bigfoot," she said. Our ruling Kraus said Missouri needs a voter I.D. law because there have been more than 16 cases of "some type of voter fraud" in Missouri. That number isn’t wrong, but it doesn’t support Kraus’ assertion that photo identification would solve the problem — or that there is a problem of people impersonating voters. Kraus’ statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Will Kraus	None	None	None	2016-01-04T09:35:38	2015-08-30	['Missouri']
pomt-02809	In Wisconsin, more than 300,000 people have "some kind of addictive gambling problem, whether it’s pathological or what we’d categorize as a problem gambler."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/27/julaine-appling/wisconsin-family-action-leader-says-more-300000-wi/	Arguing against approval of a massive tribal casino in Kenosha, the leader of a conservative social issues group recently warned of a rise in both crime and the number of gambling addicts. "When you put a new gambling establishment closer to people, you invite more people to engage in that, and it becomes addictive," Wisconsin Family Action president Julaine Appling said on Wisconsin Public Radio on Nov. 13, 2013. "As a result of that, we have more problem gamblers and more pathological gamblers." How big is the problem? "By Wisconsin Council on Problem Gambling numbers," Appling continued, "we are running over 300,000 people in this state with some kind of addictive gambling problem, whether it’s pathological or what we’d categorize as a problem gambler." Wisconsin Family Action fights expanded gambling, gay marriage and abortion, while backing school choice and teaching of alternatives to evolution theory. If Appling is correct, that would mean 5 percent of state residents would fit into that category. Is she right? Definitions first: Pathological gambling, sometimes known as compulsive gambling, can involve a need to bet more money more frequently, restlessness or irritability when attempting to stop and "chasing" losses, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling. "Problem gambling" is a broader category that includes pathological gambling but also less-serious cases that involve disruptions in any major area of life: psychological, physical, social or vocational. To back up her claim, Appling pointed us to the website of the Wisconsin affiliate of the National Council on Problem Gambling, as well as a think-tank study mentioning the council’s research. The Wisconsin Council on Problem Gambling, funded by state government and donations from Indian tribes and others, runs a 24-hour helpline and educates people about gambling’s impact. According to the council’s latest fact sheet, "approximately 333,000 Wisconsin residents have a gambling problem." Time to fold ‘em on this item? Nope. Time to hold ‘em. The number on the Council’s website doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Rose Gruber, executive director of the council, said the 333,000 figure was based on nationwide findings in the National Gambling Impact Study Commission Report requested by Congress and released in 1999. There is no Wisconsin-specific data in that study or any other we located. Gruber said the 1999 study showed that nationally, 5 percent to 7 percent of the total population had either a pathological gambling issue or are "problem" gamblers, a category that is considered less serious. In Wisconsin, that range would yield a number in the 333,000 range that Gruber’s organization cites. But there are several big problems. First, Gruber’s estimate came from the total state population, while the Impact Study Commission report she cites actually focuses strictly on the adult population. That mismatch significantly raises the Wisconsin estimate she uses. Second, we couldn’t find the 5 percent to 7 percent range in the 1999 study, nor could she point us to it. Third, the study is almost 15 years old. The Wisconsin council’s national umbrella organization, the National Council on Problem Gambling, says more recent research shows that 1 percent of U.S. adults are estimated to meet criteria for pathological gambling in a given year. An additional 2 percent to 3 percent would be considered problem gamblers. The combination (3 to 4 percent) is a significantly lower than 5 percent to 7 percent range. The national group also uses the adult population -- not total population -- when talking about the prevalence of problem gambling, based on figures cited by the national group’s veteran executive director, Keith Whyte. Applying Whyte’s figures to Wisconsin’s adult population would mean that up to 173,000 adults are problem gamblers. Outside experts To help sort this out, we turned to two of the country’s leading experts on gambling addiction: Howard Shaffer, a Harvard professor of psychiatry and past editor of The Journal of Gambling Studies, and Ken Winters, a University of Minnesota psychiatry professor. They said it was scientifically problematic to estimate Wisconsin’s problem from a national figure, but not a major shortcoming because gambling is so widespread now. Shaffer said the 3 percent to 4 percent figure was on target for adult problem gamblers. The prevalence has come down since the 1999 study, he said. Winters said the range in recent studies has been 3 percent to 6 percent. The national range cited by the pair, applied to Wisconsin, would mean that 130,000 to 260,000 Wisconsin adults are problem gamblers. Appling’s statement was broad and would include adolescent gamblers, who studies have shown more easily fall into gambling addiction. That would boost the number of problem gamblers past the adult figures we’ve discussed. Our experts said, though, that it’s hard to quantify how much because of problems inherent in studying juvenile gambling. And casinos don’t allow gamblers under 21. There’s a shortcoming in Appling’s claim that makes that something of a moot point: her use of the term "addictive." That applies to the small subset of pathological gamblers, but not to the broader group of problem gamblers who have not been diagnosed with a gambling disorder, the experts said. The "addictive" group is limited to the pathological "gambling disorder" group, and it’s 1 percent or less of adults, the two researchers said. In Wisconsin, that would be 43,400 adults or fewer, a far cry from more than 300,000. The number would still be under 100,000 if you added in adolescents at the rates we saw in various studies, 6 percent. So Appling relied on a number that turns out to be way too high, and compounded the problem with her description. Our rating Appling said more than 300,000 Wisconsinites have "some kind of addictive gambling problem, whether it’s pathological or what we’d categorize as a problem gambler." She relied on a published figure from a legitimate organization, but even in the squishy world of problem gambling research, there is little if any hard evidence that backs up this estimate extrapolated from an outdated national study. The best evidence is it’s much lower, especially when describing "addictive" gambling problems. Perhaps fewer than 45,000 Wisconsin adults fit that description, plus an unknown number of adolescents. We rate the claim False.	None	Julaine Appling	None	None	None	2013-11-27T05:00:00	2013-11-13	['Wisconsin']
pomt-02992	Says "by reducing chronic health care costs in the State of Georgia, we can reduce the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/18/hank-johnson/johnson-target-about-health-productivity-cost-link/	A Georgia congressman’s defense of the hotly debated health care law brought some skepticism from one PolitiFact reader. "By reducing chronic health care costs in the State of Georgia, we can reduce the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs," Johnson, a Democrat from DeKalb County, wrote in a letter to Daniel Patterson. Patterson forwarded the letter to PolitiFact Georgia. We hadn’t heard this claim before and decided to do some research. Johnson spokesman Andy Phelan said the numbers came from a study done by the Milken Institute, a nonpartisan, economic think tank with offices in Southern California and Washington, D.C. In October 2007, the institute released a widely reported study called "An Unhealthy America: The Economic Burden of Chronic Disease." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the study. The study’s first sentence highlighted the trouble. "More than half of Americans suffer from one or more chronic diseases," it read. The seven diseases the 240-page study focused on were cancer, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, mental disorder, pulmonary conditions and strokes. In 2003, there were 162.2 million Americans who suffered from one or more of those conditions, the study found. The productivity losses associated with those seven diseases were about $1.1 trillion. In Georgia, the Milken Institute researchers wrote in their study that the economic impact was $32.8 billion, as Johnson said. The researchers found about 5 million cases of those conditions were reported by Georgians in 2003. Pulmonary conditions and hypertension were easily the highest number of diseases reported. The researchers created an index and determined Georgia had the 31st healthiest population in the country. The healthiest states were largely along or west of the Rocky Mountains. The least healthiest states were along the Eastern Seaboard and the South. Utah was the healthiest state, and West Virginia was the least healthy state. The researchers calculated the number of lost workdays by using data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Health Interview Survey and matching all individuals who had a particular illness with the number of lost workdays in the last 12 months due to illness or injury. The next step they took was to multiply those days lost times wages per employee. Georgia’s total was 3 percent of the national cost. Georgia has about 3 percent of the nation’s population. We wondered since the study was based on 2003 figures how much the numbers have changed since then. Ross DeVol, the lead researcher, said no subsequent work had been done to determine what the total would be, but he guessed it would be greater today. "I can say with great certainty that the number is much higher today," DeVol told PolitiFact Georgia via email. Another report released in May, though, found lost productivity from various health problems was much less than the Milken Institute’s estimate. The report by Gallup-Healthways calculated the total at $84 billion a year. The conditions the Gallup-Healthways study described as chronic included asthma, cancer, depression, diabetes, heart attacks, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity and various physical pains. The estimated cost for each worker per day was $341. The Gallup-Healthways report based its findings on interviews with 94,000 adults nationwide who worked more than 30 hours a week, asking them how many workdays they missed each month due to poor health. Phone interviews were conducted from January through September 2012. The majority responded they missed about one day every three months. Phelan, the congressman’s spokesman, said he had not seen the Gallup-Healthways report beforehand. Phelan said he would reference the Milken report in future correspondence with constituents. "While both studies looked at lost productivity due to illnesses and disease, the Gallup study looks at it from the perspective of 14 job types for the entire nation while the Milken study looked at it from the standpoint of the illnesses and diseases people suffer and specifically at each state, including Georgia," Phelan said via email. There’s little additional research on this topic. The CDC looked at the economic impact of some conditions. "In 2009, the economic costs of cardiovascular diseases and stroke were estimated at $475.3 billion, including $313.8 billion in direct medical expenses and $161.5 billion in indirect costs ($39.1 billion in lost productivity due to sickness or disability and $122.4 billion in lost productivity due to premature death)," the CDC found. The $122.4 billion in lost productivity is more than the Gallup-Healthways conclusion, and that estimate was for just strokes and cardiovascular diseases. A 2001 report from the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found 2.5 billion workdays were lost a year due to chronic diseases ranging from cancer to arthritis to substance abuse. To sum up, Rep. Johnson said in a letter that "by reducing chronic health care costs in the State of Georgia, we can reduce the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs." The congressman’s claim was based on accurate numbers from a Milken Institute study that appeared well-researched. We did find other research that differs from the Milken study. Johnson’s claim is based on accurate information, but there is a little context necessary to fully examine his statement. Under our rating system, Johnson gets a Mostly True.

pomt-11837	The Republican tax bill "lets every American keep more of what they earned."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/09/kevin-mccarthy/will-every-american-get-tax-cut-house-gop-bill/	Republican lawmakers have been working to energize support for their pending tax bill by arguing that it would have a broad-based, positive impact for American taxpayers. On the Nov. 5 edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California joined the chorus. Referring to his chamber’s tax bill, McCarthy said that "it lets every American keep more of what they earned." This comment echoed what McCarthy had said a few days earlier, at the event where House Republican leaders officially unveiled the bill. "Every single American is going to keep more of what they earn," McCarthy said at the event. However, both of McCarthy’s statements are misleading. The analysis of the bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of tax bills, does show that, on average, every income range will see a tax cut. However, that’s not the same as saying "every American" will see a tax cut. Some will see an increase, perhaps because of changes in the bill that scale back the mortgage-interest deduction or the state and local tax deduction. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Decoding the tax changes The committee’s analysis projects that, between 2019 and 2022, the Republican tax bill would cut taxes for each of the 11 income ranges into which it breaks down taxpayers. On the smaller end, those earning less than $10,000 would see a cumulative tax decrease of $557 million for 2019. On the larger side, those earning more than $1 million would see a cumulative tax decrease of almost $41.6 billion for 2019. Here’s the full table: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com However, it’s worth noting two important caveats. The tax cuts eventually disappear for some income groups The joint committee found that by 2023, the tax cuts would disappear for groups with modest incomes. Specifically, those earning under $10,000 would see their taxes rise by a cumulative $100 million; those earning between $10,000 and $20,000 would see taxes rise by $638 million; those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 would see taxes rise by almost $1.2 billion; and those earning between $30,000 and $40,000 would see taxes rise by $653 billion. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com For a sense of scale, households with an adjusted gross income of $40,000 or below account for somewhere around half of households, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The analysis doesn’t mean that every single taxpayer will get a tax cut These 2019 cuts show the general pattern for all income groups, but shouldn’t be taken as gospel for every individual taxpayer and family. The figures just mean that, when all the individual cuts and increases are added up, they cumulatively produce a decrease. However, some percentage of individuals in each income group may face higher taxes right away. "Taxes go down on average for each income group in 2019, but that doesn’t mean that taxes go down for every single household," said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. One backer of the tax bill, Grover Norquist, explained this phenomenon more accurately when he wrote a column in the Washington Examiner. The headline of his article refers to how the bill "cuts taxes for all income levels." McCarthy didn’t word it that carefully. So how many Americans could face tax increases under the GOP bill? Two days after McCarthy’s comment on Face the Nation, the Joint Committee on Taxation released data that provides us with a better idea. For all income groups in 2019, the committee found that 61 percent would see a tax decrease of at least $100. Another 31 percent would see a tax change of less than $100 in either direction. That leaves 8 percent of tax filers seeing a tax increase of at least $100. In other words, while most Americans would indeed see a tax cut or a minor increase in the first year, 8 percent, or roughly 14 million American households, would see an increase of at least $100. (We approximated the raw number using Tax Policy Center data.) Meanwhile, the number of Americans facing a tax increase would grow over time. By 2027, 46 percent would see a decrease and 34 percent would see a change of less than $100, but 20 percent would see a tax increase. That could mean close to 40 million Americans would pay higher taxes in 2027 than they would under today’s tax laws. The Tax Policy Center’s own analysis largely echoed what the joint committee found. In 2018, 7.3 percent of taxpayers would see a tax increase in 2018. By 2027, that percentage would rise to 26 percent. When we checked with McCarthy’s office, they didn’t back away from his previous phrasing. "This plan reduces tax rates for every American, delivering immediate relief on income taxes on income above the standard deduction," said spokesman Matt Sparks. "And throughout their lives, this bill will let every American keep more of what they earn because the deductions, preferences, and carve-outs that are being eliminated are available to taxpayers in only a small number of years, while the benefit of lower rates and higher standard deduction are available to everyone, every year." Our ruling McCarthy said the Republican tax bill "lets every American keep more of what they earned." By the Joint Committee on Taxation's analysis, the tax bill does, on average, produce tax cuts for each of the 11 income groups it studied. But that’s not what McCarthy repeatedly said -- that it would produce a tax cut for "every American." Individual taxpayers’ situations will be affected differently by provisions in the bill, and for 2018 alone, the committee found that 8 percent of taxpayers would pay more in taxes. That translates to millions of Americans. We rate the statement False.

pomt-08613	"There's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/22/barack-obama/obama-too-soft-wall-street-public-worries-about-wa/	Skeptical voters questioned President Barack Obama about the sluggish economy at a town hall broadcast on CNBC on Sept. 20, 2010. One of those voters was a hedge fund manager who felt that Obama was being too mean to the financial community. "Listen, I represent the Wall Street community," the questioner said. "We have felt like a piñata. Maybe you don't feel like you're whacking us with a stick, but we certainly feel like we've been whacked with a stick. So I certainly think that Main Street and Wall Street are connected, and if we're going to heal the society and make the economy better, how are we going to work towards that, healing Wall Street and Main Street?" Obama replied that he often discusses the connection between Wall Street and Main Street. "We need a vibrant, vital financial sector that is investing in businesses, investing in jobs, investing in our people, providing consumers loans so they can buy products -- all that is very important and we want that to thrive. But we've got to do so in a responsible way," he said. "Now, I had been amused over the last couple years -- this sense of somehow me beating up on Wall Street -- I think most folks on Main Street feel like they got beat up on," Obama said. "There's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street," he added. That's probably the majority, not the minority." (We should note that Obama was interrupted by applause during these comments." We've noticed that some of Obama's political opponents repeatedly say he is anti-business, so we were intrigued by Obama's comment that "there's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street." So we went out in search of data. Interestingly, we couldn't find a poll that directly and specifically asked the public whether President Obama had been too soft or too tough on Wall Street. But we did find one poll that was pretty close. A poll conducted in May 2010 by CBS News asked, "Do you think the financial institutions on Wall Street have too much influence, too little influence, or the right amount of influence on the Obama Administration?" "Too much," said a resounding majority of 59 percent. After that, 21 percent said they were unsure, while 12 percent said the right amount and 5 percent said too little. We also found that most Americans favor new financial regulations that Obama signed into law in July. A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in August showed 61 percent approved of the legislation, the highest of any of Obama's legislative accomplishments. Finally, it's worth mentioning Gallup's poll from July that asked the public about its confidence in various institutions. Gallup asked which institutions merited "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence. The presidency garnered 36 percent confidence, while banks got 23 percent and "big business" got 19 percent. (Congress did the worst, with 11 percent.) But polls can be contradictory, particularly when questions are asked in a different way. So we looked for data that would undermine Obama's claim. We found one poll that indicated people might be more conflicted about government being tough on Wall Street. A poll from May asked people which of two scenarios they feared more: "that the government will go too far in regulating financial institutions and markets, making it harder for the economy to grow, OR, that the government will not go far enough in regulating financial institutions and markets, leaving the country at risk of another financial crisis?" Respondents split fairly evenly in this poll from Pew Research and the National Journal: 46 percent worried the government would go too far with financial regulation, while 44 percent worried government wouldn't go far enough. Another 11 percent were unsure, and the margin of error was 4 percent. But even that fits with Obama's statement that "there's a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street." Obama added, "That's probably the majority, not the minority," but his use of the word probably indicates he's unsure. Here, we're checking Obama's statement that there's "a big chunk of the country that thinks that I have been too soft on Wall Street." We didn't find a lot of polling data on this question. The question that addresses it most closely was whether "the financial institutions on Wall Street have too much influence, too little influence, or the right amount of influence on the Obama Administration." The resounding answer to that was yes, they have too much influence. We rate Obama's statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-09-22T10:02:45	2010-09-20	['None']
pomt-06560	Says his administration balanced "two budgets with over $13 billion in deficits without raising taxes."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/02/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-he-balanced-two-budgets-whil/	Gov. Chris Christie has some advice for Washington, D.C.: follow New Jersey’s lead. The Republican said in a speech last week at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., that the world doesn’t view the United States as it once did, in part because of partisan bickering. But in New Jersey, he said, "you have actually seen divided government that’s working." "We compromised, on a bipartisan basis, to get results," Christie said Tuesday. "How do we do this? How do we do it? Through leadership and compromise. Leadership and compromise is the only way you can balance two budgets with over $13 billion in deficits without raising taxes while protecting core services." As Christie mulls a possible bid for the White House, PolitiFact New Jersey looked at his tenure in the Garden State. We found his claim needs a few clarifications. The $13 billion in deficits includes a $2.2 billion mid-year deficit in the fiscal 2010 budget -- a spending plan approved by his predecessor -- and a $10.7 billion projected deficit for fiscal 2011. The $10.7 billion figure was the state’s projected structural deficit -- or the difference between the amount needed to maintain spending levels and fully fund every program mandated by state law and state revenues -- for fiscal 2011. The state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services calculated the structural deficit. Christie, in his fiscal 2012 budget proposal, dismissed the structural deficit as the "old way of budgeting." We’ll address that later. First, let’s tackle how Christie handled the $13 billion in deficits. Christie’s plan to handle the fiscal 2010 deficit included "375 line items of cuts, efficiencies and program eliminations," according to a February 2010 news release from the governor’s office. Among those was a $475 million cut in aid to school districts. The governor tackled the projected $10.7 billion deficit for fiscal 2011 by reducing property tax rebates, school and municipal aid and skipping a more than $3 billion pension payment, among other measures. New Jersey’s Constitution requires a balanced budget every year. So, Christie did balance both budgets. But is a budget balanced when the state skips a required payment to the pension system? "It’s certainly not uncommon for governors to use the word ‘balance’ imprecisely," said Bob Ward, deputy director of the New York-based Rockefeller Institute of Government. "From a private-sector perspective, a budget that simply skips a required pension payment could not be described as balanced. In the context of state government budgets, the claim may be technically correct." Let’s cede that point to the governor. But Christie signed another spending plan this summer. What happened to the fiscal 2012 budget? The Office of Legislative Services projected the fiscal 2012 structural deficit at $10.5 billion. But, in a February budget speech, the governor said the projected deficit "assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday’s New Jersey." Now, Christie said, "the baseline is zero" for budgeting. David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the Office of Legislative Services, said "that’s not an illegitimate way to look at it," but the executive branch appears to be using two different methodologies. "I don’t know what the right answer is, but it does seem like adding apples and oranges if they are using that calculation for one year and not another," he said. "In his first year in office, the governor closed more than $13 billion in deficits created because past administrations and Legislatures approved costly programs without creating sustainable sources of long-term funding to pay for them. This created monstrous deficits," Andy Pratt, a state Treasury Department spokesman, said in a written statement. "We’ve returned to a zero-based budgeting approach that starts on the assumption that we spend within our means and budget based on realistic and sustainable revenues. Except in theoretical terms, that means there are no longer any deficits to discuss." Now, let’s tackle Christie’s other point that he didn’t raise taxes. PolitiFact New Jersey previously found that while rates for the state’s three major taxes have remained the same, several experts said at least one of three tax credits programs reduced in fiscal 2011 could represent a tax hike. Our ruling The governor said his administration balanced "two budgets with over $13 billion in deficits without raising taxes." Several experts said cuts to tax credit programs could represent a tax hike. And while Christie is technically correct that he balanced two budgets with $13 billion in deficits, that figure includes a projected structural deficit. And the governor has since dismissed structural deficits as "the old way of budgeting." He can’t have it one way one year and then change it the next year. We rate the governor’s statement Half True.

pomt-03014	A $10 million fire fee proposal in St. Petersburg was "inspired" by Gov. Rick Scott.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/oct/14/fact-check-florida/bill-fosters-rick-scott-inspired-fire-fee-heres-re/	To political operatives, campaign mailers are often considered the most effective way to target voters, particularly in local elections. To fact-checkers, they’re often home to glaring distortions. Today’s example: A flier in the St. Petersburg mayor race that links incumbent Bill Foster, a $10 million fire fee and Republican Gov. Rick Scott. A headline on the mailer reads, "Bill Foster's $10 million Rick Scott-inspired fire fee." "Foster’s $10 million fire fee would have charged you for services you already pay for. Sound familiar?" the text continues. "Instead of taking leadership by cutting fluff out of the budget, Bill Foster took a page out of Rick Scott’s Tallahassee playbook and tried to charge us millions of dollars in ‘fees’ that taxed you for services the government should have already been providing -- $10 million of them!" The flier comes from Fact Check Florida, an electioneering communication organization, or ECO, that supports liberal candidates and is run by Jacksonville resident Matthew Martz. As an ECO, Fact Check Florida (nice name, by the way) can pay for ads that attack candidates, but it cannot expressly advocate for a candidate’s defeat or election. It can tell you why it thinks Foster is a bad guy but can’t tell you to vote for Foster’s opponent, Rick Kriseman. About the fire fee Yes, Foster pitched a fire readiness assessment, or "fire fee" in 2012 as a way to plug the city’s budget gap after another year of disappearing property tax revenues. But the idea was not "inspired" by Scott in any way. "It was funny because it was from Fact Check Florida," Foster told us, "and there was nothing factual about it." In Foster’s first two years in office, the city made up for lost property tax revenues (a result of declining home values) by reducing positions and program spending. Foster criticized a potential fire fee as a "backdoor tax increase" in those years. But in 2012, he suggested that instead of more cuts, the City Council approve a new fire readiness fee that would total $9 million a year, which was about the amount needed to close its gap for 2013. The latest version of the proposal called for property owners to pay $50 a year per parcel and $.21 per $1,000 of its appraised structural value annually, according to Tampa Bay Times archives. Some council members criticized the fire fee as disproportionately punishing low-income residents by asking them to pay the same amount as wealthier residents. The council rejected the idea and instead raised the city’s property tax rate for the first time in two decades. Foster recently tried to distance himself from the fire fee that he was linked to so closely in news coverage. With Kriseman using it as an example of failed leadership, Foster told the Tampa Bay Times that he did not come up with the proposal, pointing to records that showed council members asked the idea to be considered at a workshop eight months before they ultimately rejected it. (This revelation came after the mailpiece was distributed, so we don’t hold it against the group for not including.) The connection to Scott Let’s go back to the ad. At its most generous reading, the ad implies Foster followed Scott’s lead of raising fees for existing services. But that does not align with Scott’s record in office, which has not seen major tax or fee increases beyond increases to tuition. The state also has cut taxes and fees for Floridians since Scott took office. You can read about that here. Fact Check Florida's Martz defended the mailer. While the fee was "obviously" not Scott’s idea, he said, it’s similar to Tallahassee Republicans who "keep coming up with tiny ways to take money out of voters’ pockets without them noticing." "Under Rick Scott, it was with tuition rates," he said. "And before he got there, the Republicans did it with driver’s license renewals and things." Martz’s last point refers to $2.2 billion in increased taxes and fees that Republican lawmakers passed in 2009 -- before Scott became governor. The St. Petersburg mayor’s race is nonpartisan, but the injection of Scott highlights the political differences between the two candidates. Foster is a Republican who has Scott’s endorsement, while Kriseman is Democrat whose campaign is being partly financed by the Florida Democratic Party. Another third-party group led by Tallahassee lobbyist David Ramba is attacking Kriseman in a separate mailer for sharing partisan policies akin to the ones that brought about the government shutdown. The evolution was inevitable after the city voted in 1993 to move to a strong mayor system, argues Darryl Paulson, University of South Florida St. Petersburg professor emeritus of government. In the case of this ad, tying Foster with an unpopular governor appeals to the emotions of voters, Paulson said. "The Democrats are in essence trying to say that even though it’s not a partisan race, look who is supporting Foster, and we as Democrats hate the governor," Paulson said. "It’s really designed as a get out the vote effort to get Democratic voters to to vote in a nonpartisan election."

pomt-06315	Under a Wisconsin bill, "minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws, seat belt laws, parking infractions, etc., would now be arrestable offenses."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/14/john-birch-society/john-birch-society-says-wisconsin-bill-would-let-p/	The John Birch Society gained a national following in the 1960s when, according to a video done for the New York Times, the ultra-conservative group "saw communism everywhere: in the civil rights movement, in Congress, in the office of the United States president." Its profile may have faded, but the Wisconsin-based organization is still active. Among other things, the John Birch Society holds seminars around the country to oppose Agenda 21, a United Nations program it says "seeks for the government to curtail your freedom to travel as you please, own a gas-powered car, live in suburbs or rural areas, and raise a family." The society is also warning of a little-noticed measure pending in the Wisconsin Legislature, Assembly Bill 237. In an article critical of the bill that was posted on its website Nov. 4, 2011, the group said that under the bill, "minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws, seat belt laws, parking infractions, etc., would now be arrest-able offenses." Handcuffs and jail for letting a dog run loose, failing to buckle up or parking improperly? Let’s find out. To support its claim about the bill -- which passed one Assembly committee, 9-0, on Oct. 25, 2011, and is waiting to be scheduled for a vote by the full Assembly -- the society’s article cited two things: The bill’s language and a list of offenses that would become "arrest-able." The one-sentence bill simply says law enforcement officers "may arrest a person for a law violation that is punishable by a civil forfeiture." The word arrest indicates the claim by the John Birch Society is on the right track. Indeed, the claim suggests the arrests allowed under the bill would be a dramatic change from the status quo. An analysis by the state Legislative Reference Bureau doesn’t elaborate much on the bill, which was introduced by Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, husband of Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch. But a memo from the state Legislative Council, which provides legal and other research services to the Legislature, said the bill provides law enforcement officers "additional arrest authority" for state civil forfeitures -- non-criminal offenses prohibited by state law. The bill is needed mainly for two reasons, said Joel Kleefisch’s research assistant, Stephanie Kundert: to provide uniform enforcement around Wisconsin of state forfeitures, which are punishable by a fine; and to protect law enforcement agencies from lawsuits like one filed against the Brookfield Police Department in suburban Milwaukee. In that case, a Milwaukee woman was arrested at gunpoint in July 2010 after attending a Brookfield church service while wearing a holstered handgun. The woman, assisted by the Wisconsin Carry gun-rights group, filed a federal civil rights suit, which the City of Brookfield settled in January 2011 by paying her $7,500. One legal claim the woman made was police had no legal authority to arrest her and that helped expose the need for the Kleefisch bill, said Brookfield Assistant Police Chief Dean Collins, who is the main promoter of the bill. By way of background, Collins, who served more than 30 years in the Milwaukee Police Department, pointed out that state law already gives police the power to make arrests under three sets of circumstances: For felony and misdemeanor crimes. For local ordinance violations, such as a dog at large. For traffic offenses, including parking violations or failing to wear a seat belt. So, despite what the John Birch Society claim suggests, a dog at large is already an arrest-able offense in communities that have such an ordinance; and failing to wear a seat belt and parking violations are among traffic violations that already are arrest-able offenses statewide. But, ironically, no state law gives officers the power to enforce state forfeitures. "It’s a void in the law and it was just not noticed for many, many years," Collins said at an Oct. 19, 2011 public hearing on the bill. The Kleefisch bill -- endorsed by state associations that represent Wisconsin’s police chiefs, sheriffs and district attorneys -- is needed so officers can enforce state forfeitures, such as the one that prohibits dogs at large, in communities where no such local ordinance exists, Collins said. More importantly, he said, the bill would give legal authority for officers statewide to enforce more serious state forfeitures that are not covered by local ordinances. In a letter to lawmakers, Collins cited a number of offenses many would consider serious: Electioneering at a polling place Intoxicated or reckless flying of aircraft Felons installing burglar alarms Hotel rooms used for underage use of alcohol or drugs Disturbance of human graves Transportation of firearms Tattooing of children The list also include offenses that might be considered less serious: trespassing on private property; sending unsolicited faxes; fireworks violations; body passing at sports events; improper use of laser pointers and refusal to pay bus fare. Haven’t police and sheriff’s deputies already been enforcing such things? Kundert said many police agencies have been doing so for many years, even though they lack explicit legal authority. Officers investigate a state forfeiture violation and report it to the county district attorney. In turn, the district attorney can file an action in Circuit Court that can result in a person being ordered to pay a fine. Collins predicted that if the Kleefisch bill does not become law, some law enforcement agencies will stop taking action for state forfeitures for fear of being sued like Brookfield was. Wisconsin Carry, which opposes the bill, says it "vastly expands police authority" and won’t legally protect police agencies that make arrests like Brookfield did in the gun case. A final point before we conclude. Collins stressed that the word arrest has broad meaning in the law. An arrest can involve being handcuffed and put in jail; but legally a person is under arrest just by being detained and questioned by an officer, he said. Our conclusion The John Birch Society said that under a bill pending in the Legislature, "minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws, seat belt laws, parking infractions, etc., would now be arrest-able offenses." Dog at large violations are already arrest-able in communities that have such ordinances and seat belt and parking violations are arrest-able statewide -- though the arrest typically does not involve handcuffs or jail, but rather a person being detained or perhaps ending up with a fine. The bill would make numerous state forfeitures arrest-able. But that would simply give legal authority for something officers already doing -- detaining and sometimes referring to prosecutors people suspected of violating non-criminal state laws. The John Birch Society statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information. That’s our definition of Half True.

pomt-00572	Says Scott Walker "cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/09/hillary-clinton/scott-walker-limited-early-voting-made-it-harder-c/	In pursuing a 2016 bid for the White House, Gov. Scott Walker has seized opportunities to criticize Hillary Clinton. So it was no surprise when the Democratic frontrunner included Walker in an attack she made on four of the GOP presidential contenders. On June 4, 2015, Clinton gave what the Associated Press called one of her most partisan speeches as a presidential candidate. At historically black Texas Southern University in Houston, she accused Walker, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush of trying to make it more difficult for millions of Americans to vote. Clinton started the attack in a folksy way, saying: "Now, some of you may have heard me or my husband say one of our favorite sayings from Arkansas -- of course, I learned it from him: ‘If you find a turtle on a fence post, it did not get there on its own.’ Well, all of these problems with voting just didn’t happen by accident." Moments later, she made the claim we want to check, saying: "In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote." Clinton made the claim six days after Marc Elias, the general counsel for her campaign and an election law expert, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that voter-rule changes in Wisconsin since Walker took office amount to voter suppression. As we'll see, Walker did cut back on so-called early voting for all voters, but the changes that could make it more difficult for college students would affect only some students. Early voting Walker has signed two measures that restrict early voting -- or more precisely, in-person absentee voting. That's where you cast your ballot at your local municipal clerk's office prior to Election Day. 1. In May 2011, Walker signed a law requiring a photo ID to vote (more on that below). That measure also shortened in-person absentee voting to two weeks, including one weekend. The change meant the final day for in-person absentee voting was the Friday before Election Day, which always falls on a Tuesday in Wisconsin. Previously, municipalities could offer early voting as soon as ballots were printed, usually for about 30 to 45 days including weekends, through the final day before the election. 2. In March 2014, Walker signed legislation that eliminated early voting on weekends. It's now allowed only between 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays. However, Walker used his partial veto powers to nix language that would have restricted early voting in Milwaukee and other cities to 45 hours a week. College students Two other provisions in the measures signed by Walker arguably are more likely to affect at least some college students as compared to other groups of voters. 1. The photo ID law, which applies to nearly all voters, has not been used much yet. The 2011 law was in effect for a statewide primary election in February 2012, but then was blocked as it was challenged in court. Ultimately, it was restored after the U.S. Supreme Court, in March 2015, rejected a challenge to the law. Since then, it has been used in three local special elections. The first statewide election when photo ID will be in use will be the spring primary in February 2016. The photo ID law requires residents to present a document that includes a photo in order to vote. The document could be a driver’s license, passport, state ID, or a college ID, among other things. But there was a twist when it came to college IDs. Under the law, photo IDs from accredited, Wisconsin-based colleges and universities can be used to vote, but only if they have signatures on them and expired within two years of being issued. Most IDs issued by University of Wisconsin System schools when the law was adopted didn't meet those criteria, though that is changing. As a practical matter, the vast majority of Wisconsin residents attending school in-state -- since they possess a Wisconsin drivers license or state ID -- wouldn't need a college ID in order to vote. But the voter ID law does present a new hurdle for residents of other states who attend school in Wisconsin and want to vote in Wisconsin. Since most do not have a Wisconsin drivers license, they would need to obtain a photo ID that is approved for voting. All UW System campuses but one now offer a college ID that can be used for voting, UW System spokesman Alex Hummel told us. Students need to obtain one at their campus, as the standard college ID they received when enrolling doesn’t comply with the photo ID law. UW-Stout, meanwhile, has created a new voter ID-compliant card that it is giving to new students. It plans to have all students using the new card by Oct. 1, 2015. 2. The other measure that arguably has more impact on college students requires voters to have been a resident of the voting ward for at least 28 days; previously, it was 10 days. That could affect out-of-state students in August primary elections, since some might not have been in the state 28 days before the primary. Our rating Clinton said Walker "cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote." Legislation signed by Walker reduced the number of days allowed for so-called early voting, in which voters cast absentee ballots at a municipal clerk's office before Election Day, but the blanket claim about college students overstates those changes. Some provisions could make it more difficult for certain college students to vote -- if, for example, they don't have a Wisconsin drivers license, or moved to Wisconsin less than 28 days before an election. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. (Here is a look at other factchecks from Clinton's speech, relating to the other GOP contenders.)

pomt-07677	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s "budget okays disposing of unclaimed pound dogs to university research facilities."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/09/blog-posting/bloggers-claim-wisconsin-gov-scott-walkers-budget-/	In critiques that zipped from blog to blog and bounced around on Facebook and Twitter, critics of Gov. Scott Walker are jumping on a dog-related change in the governor’s new two-year budget. Walker’s budget plan for 2011-’13 amends a state statute (174.13) that allows dog pounds to sell -- for $1 -- unclaimed stray canines to public universities for "scientific or educational purposes." What does it mean? Interpretations in the blogosphere ranged from the relatively tame ("Walker's budget okays disposing of unclaimed pound dogs to University research facilities") to vicious ("Governor Scott Walker wants to kill puppies.") It wasn’t just random bloggers weighing in, and not all the reaction was so personal and so broad. Wisconsin Dog Rescue, a network of shelters and rescue groups, said on its website that Walker’s budget was seeking to "expand" the number of institutions that could receive dogs from pounds. "The public didn’t even know it could happen," Lori Fowler, owner of the Wisconsin Dog Rescue website, said of selling strays for research. "People are concerned that if their dog went stray … conceivably under the law their dog could be sold." What’s the truth? Would Walker’s budget legalize the practice -- or expand it -- as bloggers suggest? First some background. Seventeen states -- but not Wisconsin -- ban dog pounds or shelters from turning over stray dogs for research, according to John J. Pippin, a doctor who tracks state laws for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. Thirty-one states allow shelters to decide (as in Wisconsin) or have no state law on this. Two states, including Minnesota, require shelters to give up strays on demand to research facilities. The data is from a widely cited July 2010 study by the American Humane Association, which advocates against "pound seizure." As a practical matter, neither the University of Wisconsin System nor the Medical College of Wisconsin gets dogs from shelters anymore, officials with each institution told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Shelters in Wisconsin for years have chosen not to provide dogs for research, according to the top officials at the Wisconsin Humane Society and the Milwaukee Area Domestic Animal Control Commission. But both the UW System and the Medical College do obtain dogs for medical research -- from sources other than animal shelters. The Medical College used 140 dogs in its cardiovascular research lab last year and is on track to use 50 this year. The dogs were purchased for $200 each from a vendor in rural Minnesota that cares for abandoned dogs, said college spokesman Richard Katschke. UW used 237 dogs last year for studies on cardiovascular disease, bone and cartilage healing, genetic conditions and other issues, according to Eric Sandgren, director of UW’s Research Animal Resources Center. They are not strays -- they are "purpose bred" dogs, typically beagles, that are raised for research purposes, Sandgren said. The dogs come from two companies in the Madison area. Medical schools in the United States used to routinely use dogs for teaching purposes -- not just research -- but have discontinued that over the last couple decades, Pippin said. What does all this have to do with Walker’s budget bill? Let’s take a look. According to the legislative history of the law, it’s not a creation of Walker -- it’s been on the books for at least 40 years. The law was changed in the 1970s to make releasing dogs a voluntary decision by the shelters. The only change in the existing dog law proposed now is the insertion of "University of Wisconsin-Madison" in two sections. Walker’s office said the change has no practical impact. We reviewed the legislative history, and agree: Walker is making a technical amendment to the dog law, necessitated by his separate move to split UW-Madison off from the UW System. The bottom line: To make that change, numerous state statutes in dozens -- maybe hundreds of places -- where the UW System is mentioned must be amended. That is the only reason we could find why the statute is mentioned in the budget bill. The Wisconsin Dog Rescue organization, which wants to repeal the statute, is urging people to call legislators to block the "expansion" of the list of institutions that have the option of buying dogs for research. We asked Fowler of the dog rescue group how it could be an expansion, since UW-Madison already was a possible receiver of strays because it is part of the UW System -- which, of course, is already named in the statute. Fowler said Walker could have left Madison out and reduced the opportunities for dogs to be sold. She also worried that if UW-Madison is somehow deemed a private facility because it is splitting off from the UW System, that could open the door for strays to be sold to private research operations. She concedes, however, that Walker’s move would not actually add an additional university to the list as a practical matter. So, let’s see if the original claim has any bite left in it. To sum up, bloggers are saying Walker is responsible for inventing a dog pipeline from animal shelters to research labs where the dogs die for important medical research. A rescue group suggested his budget amendment would expand the pipeline. But the provision predates Walker’s administration by decades, and by numerous accounts, it is not used because of decisions by shelters. The law, like dozens of others, is mentioned in the budget only for technical reasons, and the proposed amendment would have no practical effect. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08428	Says Kurt Schrader "cast the deciding vote that failed to extend tax cuts for Oregon’s middle-class families and small businesses."	false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/19/scott-bruun/scott-bruun-says-kurt-schrader-was-deciding-vote-n/	When Democrats adjourned without taking action on the George W. Bush-era tax cuts, which will expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn’t act, they had to know that it would be the perfect fodder for Republican attacks. So maybe Rep. Kurt Schrader, who represents Oregon’s 5th District, wasn’t surprised when he saw this recent e-mail jab from Republican challenger Scott Bruun: "Schrader cast the deciding vote that failed to extend tax cuts for Oregon’s middle-class families and small businesses." The attack goes on to quote some bits from a Sept. 29, 2010, article in The Hill. Bit No. 1: "House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters Wednesday that the House would not vote on the expiring George W. Bush-era tax cuts before lawmakers break for the November midterm elections." Bit No. 2: "Members who voted to adjourn were ‘putting their election above the needs of your constituents,’ (House Minority Leader John) Boehner said in his speech. ‘Vote no on this adjournment resolution. Give Congress the chance to vote on extending tax rates.’" PolitiFact Oregon decided to do a quick reality check on this claim, lest those "middle-class families and small businesses" Bruun references be misled by some political doublespeak. Let’s start first with the vote’s dynamics: On Sept. 29, 2010, the House voted to adjourn. The vote was a close one. So close, in fact, that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi actually had to cast a vote -- something she doesn’t do all that often. (The Washington Post’s Votes Database says she has cast 94 votes this Congress; other members have voted more than 1,500 times.) In the end, 210 representatives voted to adjourn while 209 voted against adjourning. Schrader was in the majority. Did he cast the deciding vote? We’d say the deciding vote belongs to Pelosi, if only because she doesn’t typically vote on procedural things like this. But we’ll be ridiculously lenient here and say that because the difference between the two sides was just one vote, any of the members voting to adjourn could be said to have cast the deciding vote. So, let’s get into the politics of the thing. Normally, a procedural vote wouldn’t be an issue, but it is this time around because Democrats and Republicans had been going back and forth for a couple of weeks -- at least -- about just what parts of the Bush-era tax cuts should be allowed to expire. As The New York Times put it, generally everybody agrees that the cuts will be extended "for the roughly 98 percent of households in which couples have less than $250,000 in annual income or individuals earn less than $200,000." Most Republicans and some Democrats, however, also want to extend the tax cuts for the top 2 percent. Ultimately, Democratic leadership decided to table the matter until after the November elections and adjourn without deciding one way or another. Bruun takes this to mean that the House (read: Democrats) failed to extend tax cuts for "Oregon’s middle-class families and small businesses." But that’s not right. Congress is expected to pick the issue up once it reconvenes. There’s been no decision for or against the extension, but, generally, most everybody seems to agree that some piece of the tax cuts will be extended. Bruun is clearly trying to equate a vote for adjournment with a vote not to extend tax cuts, and that’s just not the case. PolitiFact Oregon dubs this claim False. Comment on this item.

pomt-09663	A data-storing microchip "would be implanted in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/25/chain-email/chain-e-mail-says-those-public-option-will-have-ge/	It's a recipe for a great conspiracy theory: a big health care bill, an effort to centralize medical records and a new microchip that can be implanted under your skin. Just add outrage and stir! A chain e-mail warns darkly that an "implantable radio frequency transponder system for patient identification and health information" would be "implanted in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option" -- the government-run insurance plan designed as an affordable option for people who are uninsured or whose employers don't offer health coverage. The chip would "collect data in medical patients," including "claims data" and "electronic health records." Americans, the e-mail continues, would likely flock to the the public option. This would mean that "the number of people chipped will be plentiful as well. Children conceived by parents who are already covered under the public option will more than likely be implanted with a chip by the consent of the parent. Eventually everyone will be implanted with a chip. And with the price and coverage of the public option being so competitive with the private companies, the private company [sic] may not survive." This seems on its face to be so ridiculous that we wondered if it was satire. But we couldn't find its origins. Meanwhile, the e-mail is making the rounds (it was sent to us by a reader who wondered whether it's true) and we found it posted on dozens of blogs, so we decided to examine it. First, let's get out of the way the one grain of truth in the claim -- a rice-sized grain, to be precise. A company called PositiveID, which has its headquarters in Delray Beach, Fla., sells a small microchip that can be implanted under the skin for identification purposes. It can be read from a few inches away by a handheld scanner. The company began working on its product in December 2001, and by October 2004, it had received the Food and Drug Administration's approval to insert the device into patients. According to the company, a few hospitals have "agreed to use the technology in their emergency departments." Unlike the way the chip was described in the chain e-mail, the device provides only an identification number and does not, by itself, store health data. Instead, a medical provider would be able to access the person's medical records by scanning the device's unique number and using it to connect to the company's "secure, private online database," which includes the person's health records. The device "is always with you and cannot be lost or stolen," the company's Web site says. "It provides emergency room doctors and nurses with your vital medical and emergency contact information, allowing them to treat you rapidly, accurately and safely during an emergency." The company adds that the microchip does not contain "any Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking capabilities. And unlike conventional forms of identification, [it] cannot be lost, stolen, misplaced, or counterfeited. It is safe, secure, reversible, and always with you." Now, this chip is probably not everyone's cup of tea. But lawmakers understand that reality and have not -- repeat, not -- required participants in the public option to sign up for insertion. Not even close. Indeed, as with a number of claims in chain e-mails we've reviewed relating to this year's congressional health care bills, the chain e-mail stitches together disparate words and phrases from the Senate and House health care bills to distort the truth. The bill produced by three House committees, H.R. 3200, included a provision to create a National Medical Device Registry, which would centralize data on medical devices (from pacemakers to artificial limbs) so that experts and the public could analyze how safe and effective different kinds of medical devices are. The bill decreed that items the FDA classifies as Class III — the 10 percent of devices that, according to the FDA, "sustain or support life, are implanted, or present potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury" -- would be included in the registry, as would any Class II device (a category of less-complex items accounting for 43 percent of all devices) "that is implantable, life-supporting, or life-sustaining." And that's where the red-flag word "implantable" popped up in the bill. Lots of medical devices are "implantable" -- think of heart stents, artificial knees and dental fillings. But microchips make for a good conspiracy theory, so the e-mail focuses on them. Even if microchips had somehow been the target of that line in the bill -- and they're not -- the provision in question, which doesn't appear in the Senate bill, only talks about creating a database that keeps tabs on devices that have already been implanted in people. It says nothing whatsoever about requiring implantation "in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option." That part is fiction, pure and simple. Here's an odd postscript. As the final House version (H.R. 3962) approached a vote by the full chamber, the term "implantable" was removed from that section. It's not clear why the change was made, but the chain e-mail now has even less credibility than it did before (if that's possible). So add this one to the list of silly, discredited claims about the health bill. It's so ridiculously wrong, we rule it Pants on Fire.

pomt-12984	"Your chances of throwing it are actually a little bit better in that situation."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/dec/20/doug-pederson/doug-pederson-and-truth-about-two-point-conversion/	The Eagles missed a two-point conversion with four seconds left in Sunday’s game against the Ravens that would have given them a likely victory. Carson Wentz threw an incomplete pass over the middle to wide receiver Jordan Matthews, and fans and media wondered why they didn’t even have running back Ryan Mathews on the field. "Your chances of throwing it," coach Doug Pederson said afterwards, "are actually a little bit better in that situation." The last few years in the NFL, teams have thrown on two-point conversions far more often than they have run. But is that really the smart decision? Do you have a better a chance of converting a two-point conversion on a pass than a throw? Let’s start by confirming Pederson is not alone in favoring the pass. In regular season games since 2012, according to Pro Football Reference, teams have gone for two 366 times. They have passed the ball 275 of those times, a 75 percent rate. Teams have been successful on 132 of the passing attempts, 48 percent. That’s pretty good, and statisticians have been saying for years teams should go for two more often. But for rushing the ball, conversion rates are even better. Since 2012, 48 of the 91 two-point conversion rushing attempts, 53 percent, have been successful. Pederson, perhaps more than anyone, should know rushing the ball can be effective on a two-point conversion. Though the sample size is tiny, the Eagles ran the ball three times up the middle this year for a two-pointer. They were successful each time, including early in Sunday’s game. Pederson talked more about his decision during a press conference Monday, saying he correctly assumed the Ravens would stack the box for this late-game situation, making it a difficult running play. According to Football Outsiders, the Ravens’ defense ranks No. 2 in the league in short-yardage running plays. Mathews had dominated the Ravens for much of the game, rushing for 128 yards on 20 carries. "Listen, there was zero, in my mind, opportunity to run," he said. "Because what we anticipated is what we got defensively. They gapped out. They zero blitzed us. There was not going to be a lane. It was going to be a one-yard loss if we tried to run the football at that time." He continued, "I know what we did the first two-point conversion. It was in the first half of the game when really I decided to go for two then because of the weather. I didn’t want to take points off the board necessarily with a potential missed extra point with the way we were kicking into the wind at that time. So, that’s a different situation, different scenario. This was a true, got-to-have-it situation and we had our best play at that time against that defense." In the fourth quarter this year teams have been even more likely to pass the ball on two-point attempts, throwing 52 times compared to running 10 times. But those who’ve tried running have often been successful, converting seven of 10 fourth-quarter rushing attempts. In the last five years, teams using rush plays on two-point conversions in the fourth quarter have been successful 56 percent of the time. Teams passing the ball in the same timeframe on two-point conversions have been successful 46 percent of the time. Through a spokesperson, Pederson declined to discuss further justification for his decision or evidence for why he believed the chances of throwing it are better than running. Our ruling Eagles coach Doug Pederson chose to pass the ball on a two-point conversion that would have likely won Sunday’s game against the Baltimore Ravens. He didn’t even have running back Ryan Mathews on the field and explained "your chances of throwing it are actually a little bit better in that situation." The last five years of two-point conversion data show otherwise. Teams have converted 53 percent of running attempts on two-point conversions, compared to 48 percent of passing attempts. Pederson may have been right to throw against the Ravens, but his justification for his decision was wrong. We rule the claim False.

pomt-07639	Building and running the Atlanta Streetcar is projected to create 1,399 jobs.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/16/john-lewis/atlanta-streetcar-projected-be-jobs-boon/	Atlanta leaders heralded the city’s planned streetcar as a boon to downtown. Starting in 2013, the streetcar would ferry passengers from Centennial Olympic Park through the historic Sweet Auburn neighborhood and to Ebenezer Baptist Church, the heart of the civil rights movement. Even better, it would create jobs, according to a newsletter to constituents from U.S. Rep. John Lewis. Under the header "New jobs created by the Streetcar project," it said the line would generate 1,399 jobs to build and run it, and an additional 4,204 when it spurs economic development in surrounding neighborhoods. Sounds like a nice deal. But is that what experts really projected? We took a closer look. The $72 million streetcar project is part of an ambitious plan to modernize the city’s transit infrastructure, boost tourism and help a downtown core that has suffered since the Downtown Connector was built. Critics contend it’s a boondoggle and won’t reduce traffic congestion. Lewis, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and a coalition of local leaders won a major victory in October when they scored a $47.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to build it. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2012, but there’s no guarantee. Last month, Republicans in Congress threatened to yank the project’s funding. A spokeswoman for Lewis said the newsletter relied on a projection from groups that applied for the Department of Transportation grant. Since it was created by experts and vetted by civil service professionals at the Department of Transportation, Lewis believed it was credible. We called MARTA, which played a major role in generating the figures. Spokesman Lyle Harris initially declined to explain how the numbers were derived, so we gathered documents from Atlanta Journal-Constitution transportation reporter Ariel Hart, placed a public information request for more documentation and sent written questions, some of which MARTA answered. Our reporting turned up enough information to evaluate figures for building and running the streetcar, but not for economic development. So we will analyze the projected 1,399 construction and operations jobs. We found that the job-creation figures are not for actual positions. The Department of Transportation advised grant applicants to use a measure called "job years." "Job years" means one job lasting for one year. That means that if a single position lasts five years, it counts as five "job years." Or as the newsletter put it, "jobs." The "job years" measure has critics. George Mason University professor Stephen Fuller told us it can be confusing or give an inflated impression of the number of jobs a project creates. "They [officials] want to make people understand that what appears to be a small project will have a big impact over its lifetime," Fuller said. But it does have merits, economists told us. A project should get credit for creating jobs that last many years instead of one. And the measure helps planners tally positions such as construction jobs that rise and fall over the course of a project, said James Horney, a top fiscal policy expert at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. So even though the newsletter said that running the streetcar would create 460 jobs, that doesn’t mean transit officials plan to fill 460 full-time positions to run it. That’s the number of "job years" over a 20-year period. The actual estimate is 23 new employees. And 23 multiplied by 20 is 460. Brian Riedl, the lead budget analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said there’s a better way to communicate job impact. Just list jobs and job length separately. So you could say running the streetcar would create 23 jobs that would last 20 years. (Or longer. The line would be built to last.) Now, let’s look at the claim that the project would create 939 jobs during construction. These jobs are expected to last for one year, so for this phase, one job year equals one job. But that doesn’t mean 939 people are projected to build the streetcar line, and they won’t all be jobs for Atlantans. The newsletter used the project’s "total employment" figure, which means the number of people who would be employed for construction, plus two other types of jobs created by the project: those to make materials such as steel or rebar to construct the line, and those created when workers spend their earnings on things such as a roast beef sandwich or a new pair of tube socks. The project’s economist estimated this job number using a standard method developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Many of those jobs won’t be local because a portion of the materials and products purchased would be made outside the Atlanta area. Planners expect to employ 467 workers for streetcar construction. The rest would be making rebar, sandwiches and the like. So did Lewis get his job creation figures right? Lewis accurately cited numbers reviewed by government agencies and experts, but in the end, that vetting wasn’t enough. He used figures that would give a typical person the impression that those projected 1,399 "job years" are actual jobs. That understanding would be correct for the construction phase, but it would be 20 times higher than the actual number of positions needed to run the streetcar. Since the figures experts gave Lewis would give a typical person a false impression, we rule his statement False.	None	John Lewis	None	None	None	2011-03-16T06:00:00	2011-01-17	['None']
pomt-09048	The U.S. deficit "increases at $3 million per second."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/02/bill-clegg/clegg-claims-federal-deficit-growing-rate-3-millio/	The national debt is just over $13 trillion. That's $13 million million. If you divide the number by the U.S. Census Bureau’s world and U.S. population figures, that's nearly $42,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States and almost $1,900 for every human being on the planet. So it's understandable that a lot of candidates would want to talk about it, especially after Congress passed a landmark health-care bill that, critics contend, will add to that deficit. One is Bill Clegg, one of four Republicans who have filed to run for Congress against incumbent Democrat Rep. James Langevin in the 2nd District. On the "Federal Spending" tab of his "Issues" page, Clegg talks about how the cost of government has increased, beginning with a reference to the speaker of the House. (The web posting was written before the health-care bill passed, so the “over $12-trillion” number in the following quote was true at the time.) "And so Nancy Pelosi announced to the world her sophisticated rationale for a horrible health care bill that our elected officials attempted to ram down our throats. That was the first time when the so-called reform legislation contained such noxious provisions as mandated coverage, free rides for certain officials for their votes (think Nebraska and Senator Ben Nelson), and sleight-of-hand accounting that would add trillions to the deficit -- which is already over $12 trillion and increases at $3 million per second. As I write this, we have yet to see the fate of the latest 'bi-partisan' health legislation but you can bet it won't be cheap." What intrigued us was the assertion that the deficit was increasing by $3 million each second. (Actually, Clegg was referring to the national debt. As readers pointed out to us after this item was published, the deficit is typically used to refer to how much the government is in debt at the end of each fiscal year, terms we confused as well.) Anyway, we did some math. Three million dollars per second, times 60 seconds in a minute, times 60 minutes in an hour, times 24 hours in a day, times 365 days in a year totals out to $94.6 trillion in debt per year, more than seven times the actual debt. Clearly, $3 million per second claim is off base. So we emailed Clegg, and asked where he got it from. "I am not near my files at present so I'll get back to you but I suspect it's a math error," he responded. When we asked him a few days later if he had any luck tracking down the number, he said, "No, but it has to be an error so I'm going to revise it." By July 1, he had a new website where the "issues" page didn't have that claim, but the old page was still available. In the meantime, we checked out a few of the online “national debt clocks” that purport to track the debt and found something interesting: they don't agree, and the difference can be dramatic. We froze three of them at 3:54 p.m. on June 25. The tally was $13,109,715,680,330 at USDebtClock.org, $13,104,984,133,395 at BabylonToday.com ($4.7 billion lower), and $13,026,442,384,744 ($78.5 billion lower still) at DefeatTheDebt.com. We also checked how long it took for the clocks to add $3 million to the tally. They ranged from as little as 65 seconds for BabylonToday.com, to as long as 261 seconds for DefeatTheDebt.com, with USDebtClock.org coming in the middle, at 129 seconds. So what's the real number? That’s a good question. We found a federal debt table published by the Office of Management and Budget that listed a deficit of $11.876 trillion at the end of 2009. We subtracted it from the debt of $13.787 trillion projected for the end of 2010. That left $1.911 trillion. Dividing that by the number of seconds in a year gives a national debt that is increasing by $60,597 per second, and it takes just under 50 seconds to add $3 million to the debt. Or you can look at how fast the debt has actually been accumulating, according to the Bureau of the Public Debt, a small agency within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Data from its web page, which allows you to see how the debt has increased during any time frame since 1993, shows that from June 1, 2009 to June 1, 2010, the debt went from $11,379,966,189,575.05 (yes, they calculate it down to the penny) to $13,050,826,460,886.97, an increase of $1.67 trillion for the year, or $52,982.63 per second. So, using these historical numbers, it takes just under 57 seconds to rack up $3 million. For the record, the two agencies don’t agree on what the debt was last Dec. 31. OMB says the debt was $11.876 trillion. The Bureau of Public Debt - which says it uses a daily tally, not estimates - reports that it was $12.145 trillion, a difference we couldn’t immediately resolve. In any case, neither number is even close to the candidate's claim of $3 million added to the debt each second. So in the final tally, the Truth-O-Meter rates it as False.

pomt-12788	The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005, costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate.	true	/illinois/statements/2017/feb/16/bruce-rauner/rauner-right-about-lawmakers-four-straight-pension/	Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner has been pushing for changes to the state’s pension funds since he first began running for governor in 2013. His proposed FY 2016 budget suggested moving all state employees into a pension plan with lower benefits. He moved away from that approach once the Illinois Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a law that sought changes to pension benefits. He hasn’t, however, stopped blaming the Illinois General Assembly, with its Democratic majorities, for contributing to the state’s mushrooming pension debt. As he launched an extended media crusade this year, Rauner said legislators who approved pension contribution breaks from 2005 to 2009 cost state workers and taxpayers billions. "The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005," Rauner wrote in Springfield’s Capitol newspaper, "costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate." For several years now, Illinois has had the dubious distinction of having the worst pension debt in the nation. Illinois’ current debt was listed at $129.8 billion in November by the state General Assembly’s bipartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability. We decided to dig in to Rauner’s claim that reducing payments cost billions and was like borrowing at high interest rate. Borrowed time A 2013 settlement Illinois officials made with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission confirms the reduced pension payments for the four years in question, said Laurie Cohen, senior analyst with the Institute for Illinois’ Fiscal Sustainability at the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government finance research group. The SEC said that despite state claims that pension holidays would be offset by increased fund contributions from 2008 to 2010, a 2005 amendment allowed lawmakers to skip increasing contributions to make up for the pension contribution holidays. The SEC settlement document underscores Rauner’s claim that the delay in contributions exacerbated the state pension funds’ condition. "Although the State disclosed the basic fact of these reduced contributions," it reads, "the State did not disclose that each of these deviations exacerbated the Structural Underfunding, deferred contributions further into the future, impaired the ability of the State to meet its pension obligations, and negatively impacted the State’s creditworthiness." Daniel Hertz, a senior policy analyst with the progressive Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, agreed Rauner’s claim was supported by the facts. In an email, Hertz said, "The legislation Rauner referenced did have the effect of reducing pension contributions below what they otherwise would have been for four years, and that additional underfunding was, essentially, borrowing that increased costs down the line." According to a 2006 COGFA report, Hertz said, "the net effect of the law was to increase pension payments from the State by $6.8 billion between FY2006 and FY2045." Our ruling In an opinion piece published by a Springfield newspaper, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner said lawmakers in the Illinois General Assembly authorized reduced pension payments from 2005-2009. He said those lowered contributions cost billions and were akin to borrowing from the funds at a high interest rate. The General Assembly’s own finance agency and a federal settlement with the SEC confirms four years of reduced contributions. The SEC said the move aggravated the funds’ condition and ability to meet its obligations and worsened its creditworthiness. A 2006 report said the underfunding required $6.8 billion more in payments.

pomt-14233	Says Bernie Sanders "has been largely a very reliable supporter of the NRA."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/14/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-has-been-largely-ve/	Reeling from attacks over her ties to Wall Street, Hillary Clinton blasted Bernie Sanders over his own connections to a target of liberal ire: the gun lobby. "He’s been largely a very reliable supporter of the NRA. He kept his word to the NRA. He voted against the Brady Bill five times," Clinton said during the April 14 Democratic primary debate in New York. She’s right about his votes against background checks and waiting periods, which took place from 1991 to 1993. But what about her attack that Sanders has consistently supported the gun lobby? That’s a lot less accurate. Sanders has a mixed record when it comes to bills on guns and has actually received low marks from the National Rifle Association over his decades-long legislative career. Sanders’ gun votes In addition to Sanders’ Brady Bill votes, the Clinton campaign referred us to Sanders’ votes against funding for gun research, twice for prohibiting lawsuits against firearms manufacturers ("what the head of the NRA called the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in the last 20 years," said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin), for increasing the burden of proof to prosecute law-breaking gun dealers, and for allowing firearms on Amtrak trains and in national parks. Schwerin also noted that Sanders voted for an amendment in the Brady Bill that allows prospective gun owners to buy a firearm if their background checks are not completed in three days. This is the amendment that facilitated Dylann Roof to purchase his .45 caliber Glock pistol, which he used to kill nine people in a historically black church in Charleston in 2015. But on the flip side, Sanders also voted against the NRA’s wishes and in favor of banning assault weapons, closing the gun show loophole, regulating high capacity magazines, and expanding background checks in the wake of the Newtown elementary school massacre. We pulled together his votes on key gun bills over his 25 years in Congress (votes in bold reflect a pro-gun position): Year Legislation Sanders’ Vote Result 1993 Imposes a five-day waiting period and background checks on firearm purchases, part of the Brady Bill Nay Passed 1993 Imposes instant background checks instead for firearm purchases, part of amendment to Brady Bill Yea Passed 1993 Imposes an interim five-day waiting period while while waiting to put a instant background check system in place, part of Brady Bill conference report Nay Passed 1994 Bans semiautomatic assault weapons Yea Passed 1996 Increase funding for the Centers on Disease Control and Prevention by $2.6 million to research firearm-related injuries Nay Failed 1996 Repeals the semiautomatic weapon ban Nay Passed 1998 Increases minimum sentencing for gun crimes Yea Passed 1999 Creates "instant check registrants" and narrowly defines "gun shows," part of Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act Nay Failed 1999 Imposes three day waiting period for guns purchased at gun shows, part of amendment to gun show act Yea Failed 2002 Allows pilots and flight personnel to carry firearms in the cockpit Yea Passed 2003 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2005 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2006 Prohibits funds from being used to enforce trigger locks on guns Nay Passed 2006 Increases the burden of proof for the AFT to penalize law-breaking gun dealers, as part of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms reform bill Yea Passed 2007 Prohibits foreign aid funding restrictions on U.S. gun ownership, as an amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2008 Yea Passed 2008 Prevents the use of funds for anti-gun programs as an amendment to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Yea Passed 2009 Gives the District of Columbia seats in the House of Representatives and repeals district’s ban on semi-automatics Yea Passed 2009 Allows the use of firearms in National Parks Yea Passed 2009 Allows concealed and carry across state lines Nay Failed 2009 Allows firearms in checked baggage on Amtrak trains, as an amendment to congressional budget Yea Passed 2009 Prohibits higher insurance premiums for gun owners, as part of an amendment to the Affordable Care Act Yea Passed 2013 Prevents the U.S. from entering the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, as an amendment to congressional budget Nay Passed 2013 Allows concealed and carry across state lines in states where the practice is not prohibited Nay Failed 2013 Lists all people prohibited buying a firearm in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Yea Failed 2013 Bans high-capacity ammunition magazines carrying more than 10 rounds Yea Failed 2013 Bans assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines Yea Failed Neither a ‘gun-lobby lapdog’ nor an ‘anti-gunner’ The Clinton campaign also noted that the NRA helped elect Sanders to the House of Representatives in 1990. While it’s true that Sanders and the gun lobby were on the same side in that election, their alignment was temporary. The NRA backed Republican incumbent Peter Smith in his 1988 race against Sanders. But Smith didn’t stick to his guns and came out in favor of an assault weapons ban after he won. Feeling betrayed, the gun group spent $18,000 attacking the incumbent in 1990 and issued bumper stickers emblazoned with images of Smith as Pinocchio and "Dump Pete Smith," Garrison Nelson, a professor of state politics at the University of Vermont previously told PolitiFact. Paul Blackman, a former NRA research associate, told us in 2015 that while Sanders wasn’t exactly pro-gun and the NRA wasn’t explicitly pro-Sanders, he seemed like the lesser of two evils. "I don't remember whether we ever made a pro-Sanders statement, but we certainly made it clear that Vermonters should vote against Rep. Smith, and everyone understood that to mean we were supporting, directly or indirectly, the election of Sanders," he said. "Our people were satisfied that he was less bad than -- not equally bad as -- Smith." "It was an awkward situation for Bernie. Sort of like the enemy of my enemy is my friend," said Chris Graff, the former Vermont AP bureau chief. "The NRA did not campaign for him but Bernie did oppose the Brady Bill. ... I do believe that Bernie ‘owed’ the NRA when he first went to Congress." Since 1990, however, Sanders and the NRA seemed to part ways. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross said Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since his first days in Congress, adding he isn’t a "gun lobby lapdog." Blackman, the former NRA researcher, said the group doesn’t consider Sanders "an anti-gunner." Warren Gunnels, Sanders’ policy director, noted that Sanders’ latest grade from the NRA was a D. In fact, Sanders has earned failing grades from the NRA for the past two decades. His highest mark was a C-, a barely passing grade that doesn’t amount to full-throated support. (The group has not graded Sanders in 2016.) Year Grade 1992 D 1994 F 1996 F 1998 F 2000 F 2002 F 2004 D+ 2006 C- 2012 D- Our ruling Clinton said Sanders "has been largely a very reliable supporter of the NRA." This is a stretch. Sanders won his congressional bid about 25 years ago thanks at least in part to the NRA, and has voted against major pieces of gun control legislation. However, he has also cast votes for gun control and has received low marks from the NRA for the past 20 years. Neither the gun lobby nor gun control advocates claim Sanders as their own. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3c800a70-11ea-44a5-99cb-3bc3f6ad3e60	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-14T23:07:29	2016-04-14	['Bernie_Sanders']
pomt-02678	"Oregon is spending $10 million advertising Obamacare with ads that don’t even mention the program and how to enroll in it" and that don’t "mention the word ‘insurance.’"	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2014/jan/08/tom-coburn/cover-oregon-spending-10-million-advertising-obama/	Enrollment problems continue to dog Cover Oregon’s balky website, despite millions of dollars spent trying to get the system running. Despite the well-publicized woes, however, state officials say they are making progress toward getting people enrolled in time to avoid federal penalties. All of which makes Cover Oregon a prime target for critics who say the state’s new health-insurance marketplace is too expensive, too intrusive and too restrictive. U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., took a shot at Cover Oregon in his new "Wastebook 2013" -- a comic-book-style tome he puts out each year highlighting what he calls 100 examples of wasted taxpayer dollars. Chapter Nine, "Millions Spent Building, Promoting an Insurance Plan Few Want and a Website that Doesn’t Work," said this: "Oregon is spending $10 million advertising Obamacare with advertisements that don’t even mention the program or how to enroll in it." He singles out two television ads, both produced for Cover Oregon by NORTH, a Portland advertising agency. One spot, Coburn said, "does not mention the word ‘insurance,’ " while another, he added, "does not mention the word ‘insurance,’ but features what appears to be Gumby riding on the Beatles’ yellow submarine." The implication is that the state spent a ton of money on ads that may have been clever but not direct or effective. Did Cover Oregon spend $10 million for television ads that didn’t mention the word ‘insurance’? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The many assertions in "Wastebook 2013" are heavily footnoted, so we checked there first to see which sources Coburn relied on. The first footnote for the Cover Oregon claim took us to a July 28, 2013, cbsnews.com story, which reported that Cover Oregon’s new ad campaign cost $10 million. The second footnote linked directly to one of the Cover Oregon ads, "Fly With Your Own Wings," a 31-second animated ad that opens and closes with the words "Cover Oregon." The television ad included a pleasantly peppy song but never used the word "insurance." So on that score, at least, Coburn’s claim appears to be on the mark. Still, wondering about context, we called Mark Ray, the NORTH principal and creative director who produced the ads. The spots Coburn focuses on in his "Wastebook," Ray said, were the very first ads produced to market Cover Oregon. They were intended to raise general awareness about the program rather than rain down nuts-and-bolts specifics, he said. Details on how and where to enroll were included in subsequent spots. This is a common strategy for rolling out brand-new programs. "He’s cherry-picking something he doesn’t understand," Ray said of Coburn. In Ray’s view, the campaign has been a smashing success. The 7 percent public awareness of Cover Oregon in May, he said, had soared to 78 percent in September, based on follow-up polling. "Those are the best results I’ve had in my career," he said. So we have disagreement on omission of the word "insurance" in Cover Oregon’s first advertisements. Coburn is correct that it’s not there. But Ray adds important context in noting that the ads were early and part of a campaign designed to morph from general to specific. Newer ads, available on Cover Oregon’s YouTube page, provide details of how and where to enroll, and nearly all use the word "insurance." That still leaves the $10 million figure cited in Coburn’s "Wastebook." Wanting to know exactly what the figure, in the senator’s view, represented, we contacted John Hart, Coburn’s communications manager. He spoke only of Cover Oregon’s initial television ads. In an email, he wrote, "If the state of Oregon or local communities like Portland want to fund these ads we would applaud their effort to make their state a haven for indie rockers or lumberjacks without insurance, as the ad melodically suggests." Neither he nor "Wastebook 2013" addressed any other elements of the marketing campaign. We then called Michael Cox, Cover Oregon’s communications director. He said the ads singled out in the "Wastebook" actually cost $3.5 million to produce and air. The $10 million figure, he said, came from a news report cited in the "Wastebook" footnotes that mistakenly conflated the total costs of the campaign’s first phase -- which included Spanish-language spots, information fliers and fact sheets -- with the costs of the TV ads Coburn spotlighted. Even then, he said, the total costs of the first phase were $8.3 million, not $10 million. We called Coburn’s office again and asked Hart about the figures provided by Cox. "We didn’t claim they’ve spent $10 million," Hart said. "That was the amount budgeted. If they’ve spent less, that’s terrific." We glanced back at "Wastebook 2013," which leads its Cover Oregon claim by saying, "Oregon is spending $10 million advertising Obamacare…" Cover Oregon has not spent $10 million on the ads Coburn singles out in his "Wastebook 2013." A budget passed along by Cox puts the figure at $3.5 million. A Coburn spokesman brushed aside the difference by saying his office never said that $10 million had been spent, only that it had been budgeted. The spokesman’s own words, however, are contradicted by the senator’s "Wastebook 2013" entry on Cover Oregon. On Coburn’s first claim, the Cover Oregon ads in question do not mention the word "insurance." But the context in this case is vital. These were not the campaign’s only ads, and later ads make details clear. We also find that the senator completely missed the mark on the amount of money spent. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-06647	Mitt Romney "drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/13/gail-collins/mitt-romney-and-dog-car-roof-one-columnists-obsess/	Gail Collins loves telling the story of how Mitt Romney drove his family to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car -- and telling it, and telling it, and telling it. The liberal New York Times columnist has mentioned the incident in print 19 times, by our count. She devoted a column to the incident in 2007 when Romney first ran for president. In another column, she suggested John McCain pick Romney for his running mate "so I can repeatedly revisit the time Mitt drove to Canada with the family dog on the station-wagon roof." And when Sarah Palin was picked instead, and Collins opined that "unlike Mitt Romney, she has never gone on vacation with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car." Collins regularly includes the incident in jocular news quizzes she writes. (A typical question: Which Republican hopeful "continued to fail to explain why he drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car?" Mitt Romney.) She complained that his 2010 campaign book No Apology didn't mention it, calling it "a critical oversight." Last year, just in time for the holidays, she suggested someone make "a tasteful Mitt Romney Christmas Ornament" depicting the scene of the dog on the roof. And just last week, she noted that the issue wasn't discussed during the Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Library. Romney's top rival, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, reportedly shot a coyote that was threatening his daughter's dog, which made the Romney anecdote relevant. "His puppy-rescue is a stirring picture, especially considering that Perry's chief competitor is the man who drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car." Aside from wondering why Collins is so obsessed with the story, we also wondered: Is it true? We reached Collins to ask her why she liked the story so much, but she said she'd rather let her columns speak for themselves. (See a picture of Seamus here.) The story of Seamus the Irish setter is not an Internet rumor. It first appeared in the august pages of the Boston Globe in 2007, when the paper published a seven-part profile of Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who had just launched a presidential run. The story of Seamus kicked off Day Four, a story about Romney's family life, written by Globe reporters Neil Swidey and Stephanie Ebbert. It begins in 1983 with a 36-year-old Mitt Romney carefully packing up his five sons and luggage into the family station wagon for a 12-hour trip from Boston to Ontario, where his parents had a cottage on Lake Huron. At the time, Romney was a successful young consultant with Bain & Company, but he hadn't yet started buying and selling companies with Bain Capital in the private equity field. "As with most ventures in his life, he had left little to chance, mapping out the route and planning each stop. ... Before beginning the drive, Mitt Romney put Seamus, the family's hulking Irish setter, in a dog carrier and attached it to the station wagon's roof rack. " Cruel? It's not presented that way in the story, which noted Romney built a special windshield for the carrier, "to make the ride more comfortable for the dog." But Seamus must not have been all that comfortable, because he began to experience, um, gastric distress. From the story: As the oldest son, Tagg Romney commandeered the way-back of the wagon, keeping his eyes fixed out the rear window, where he glimpsed the first sign of trouble. ''Dad!'' he yelled. ''Gross!'' A brown liquid was dripping down the back window, payback from an Irish setter who'd been riding on the roof in the wind for hours. As the rest of the boys joined in the howls of disgust, Romney coolly pulled off the highway and into a service station. There, he borrowed a hose, washed down Seamus and the car, then hopped back onto the highway. It was a tiny preview of a trait he would grow famous for in business: emotion-free crisis management. As the story quickly made its way around the Internet, Romney loathers -- and dog lovers -- had a field day. The liberal blog Wonkette said it showed Romney would be a great commander-in-chief for the notorious Iraq prison Abu Ghraib. David Kravitz of the liberal blog Blue Mass Group called it "nuts" and "classic Romney: it solves a problem efficiently, in a business-like manner, and with no regard whatsoever for the suffering that the solution may cause." Ingrid Newkirk of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals told Time's Ana Marie Cox that Romney was giving his children "a lesson in cruelty" and that dogs under extreme stress might lose control of their bowels. "That alone should have been sufficient indication that the dog was, basically, being tortured," she said. Cox explored whether Romney's actions might have been illegal under animal cruelty laws. (A moot point, because the statute of limitations has long expired.) As to the accuracy of the story, the Globe learned of the incident from friends of the family and confirmed the details with the Romney family. And the candidate himself didn't dispute the report. In fact, in the days following, he defended it. Seamus loved riding in the carrier, Romney told reporters on the campaign trail in 2007. "He scrambled up there every time we went on trips," Romney said. "He got (up) all by himself and enjoyed it." He also said PETA had targeted him because there was a rodeo at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, and because he went quail hunting in Georgia. "And they're not happy that my dog likes fresh air," he added. Actually, Seamus had been dead -- of natural, non-station wagon-related causes -- for years when the story appeared. (He had retired to California to live with Romney's sister, who had more space.) We didn't get answers about Seamus from the Romney campaign, but from Neil Swidey, the Boston Globe reporter who unearthed the story. Swidey said he chose the incident to begin his story because he thought it would resonate with readers as an illustration of Romney's approach to solving problems -- trip is interrupted by dog poop, so Romney pulls over, borrows a hose, takes care of the problem, and is back on his way. "I certainly didn't write it to make it the basis on which you judge a presidential candidate. The fact that some people appear to be doing that is a little bit crazy. But I can understand why it resonates with people," Swidey said. "It's a window into how this guy operates." Swidey said some people see it as evidence of Romney's heartlessness, while others see him as logical man and a problem solver. He confirmed the impression we got from reading the story, that the incident was amusing family lore, and that none of the Romney family was upset or disturbed by the dog riding on the roof. In fact, some of the Romneys said they thought the dog actually liked riding on the roof. (Finally, lest we be accused of utter frivolousness, we asked Swidey what aspects of Romney's biography might be more relevant to voters considering Romney for president. He pointed us toward the Globe's coverage of Romney's business career in private equity, his time as governor and Romney's relationship with his father George, who ran for president himself back in 1968.) Here, we're ruling on Collins' statement that Romney "drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car." It's important to note that the dog was not literally strapped to the car, as in tied around its midsection. Rather, Seamus was in a carrier with a protective windscreen that Romney had built. The dog's diarrhea might indicate that something was amiss, but Romney's family didn't seem bothered by it. The anecdote is presented in the Globe as funny family story, not as evidence of Romney's barbaric cruelty. We rate Collins' statement Mostly True.

pomt-07322	President Obama’s health care law "represents a government takeover of health care."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/13/mitt-romney/romney-calls-obamas-health-care-law-government-tak/	Some talking points keep getting recycled, even when they're not true. Such is the case with the claim by many Republicans that the new health care law is "a government takeover of health care." PolitiFact has repeatedly rated that False or Pants on Fire and selected it as our 2010 Lie of the Year. But the line still gets repeated, most recently by likely presidential candidate Mitt Romney. During a speech in Ann Arbor, Mich., on May 12, 2011, Romney sought to explain how the health care plan he signed as governor of Massachusetts was different than the law signed by President Barack Obama. The Massachusetts plan -- passed with bipartisan support in the Legislature in 2006 -- shares many features with the Obama plan, so it poses a political problem for Romney. In the speech, Romney sought to draw distinctions between the Massachusetts plan and Obama’s. He said, "When I ask people what they dislike most about the president’s plan, what I typically hear is they say, ‘Obamacare represents a government takeover of health care, and I don’t like it.’ And I think they’re right." He made the same point in an accompanying PowerPoint slide, which called "Obamacare" "a government takeover of health care," as opposed to "Mass-Care," which he said was designed to "help people get and keep their health insurance." We have examined the government takeover claim in detail in our previous coverage, but since the line is being used by a likely 2012 presidential candidate, it's worth revisiting why we found it flatly incorrect. "Government takeover" conjures a European approach in which the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees. But the law Congress passed, parts of which have already gone into effect, relies largely on the free market. Critics of the law are correct that it significantly increases government regulation of health insurers. But it is, at its heart, a system that relies on private companies: • Employers continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies. • Contrary to the claim, more people will get private health coverage. The law sets up "exchanges" where private insurers will compete to provide coverage to people who don't have it. • The government will not seize control of hospitals or nationalize doctors. • The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers. • The law gives tax credits to people who have difficulty affording insurance, so they can buy their coverage from private providers on the exchange. But here too, the approach relies on a free market with regulations, not socialized medicine. Critics of our conclusion have said the significant increase in government regulation -- which, among other things, requires that adults have health insurance -- justifies the use of the term. In an editorial responding to our Lie of the Year choice, the Wall Street Journal wrote that "at the heart of ObamaCare is a vast expansion of federal control over how U.S. health care is financed, and thus delivered. The regulations that PolitiFact waves off are designed to convert insurers into government contractors in the business of fulfilling political demands, with enormous implications for the future of U.S. medicine. All citizens will be required to pay into this system, regardless of their individual needs or preferences. Sounds like a government takeover to us." Michael Cannon, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, went so far as to announce that he was boycotting PolitiFact because of problems he had with both the "government takeover" article and the previous year’s Lie of the Year -- former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s argument that the Obama health care bill included "death panels." When we asked Romney’s camp to explain their use of the term "government takeover," spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom said, "It seems pretty obvious that under Obamacare, the federal government takes on a vastly expanded role in health care. Whether you call it a ‘takeover’ or a ‘power grab,’ the effect is the same -- it shifts power and responsibility from the states to Washington and suffocates the nation under a massive, byzantine bureaucracy fueled by a half trillion dollars in higher taxes." But we find flimsy evidence for such a strong claim. The government's expanded role in health falls far short of being a government takeover. As we said in our Lie of the Year announcement, analogies about strict government regulation provide some helpful illustrations. The Federal Aviation Administration imposes detailed rules on airlines. State laws require drivers to have car insurance. Regulators tell electric utilities what they can charge. Yet that heavy regulation is not described as a government takeover. There's no question that "government takeover" has been a successful talking point. A poll in March 2010 found that a majority of the American people believed it was true. But the facts simply don't support it. The health care law continues to depend on private health insurance and private-sector physicians. So Romney earns the same rating as others who have made the false claim: Pants on Fire!

pomt-00165	"The poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans -- it’s been incredible, they’ve all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country."	true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/oct/23/donald-trump/african-american-hispanic-poverty-all-time-low/	At a rally in Wheeling, W.Va, President Donald Trump touted record-low poverty rates for minorities in the United States. "The poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans -- it’s been incredible, they’ve all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country," he said at the rally on Sept. 29, 2018. Is this correct? Yes, at least as far back as poverty data has been calculated. First, a refresher on how poverty is calculated. The Census Bureau "uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. If a family's total income is less than the family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty." While the official poverty line is the same regardless of geography, they are updated yearly for inflation. Non-cash benefits, such as public housing, Medicaid, or food stamps, are not factored into the calculation. We looked at Census Bureau data for the poverty status by race and Hispanic origin from 1966 to 2017. Here’s the full run of that data: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In 2017, African-American poverty was 21.2 percent, which was below the previous record low of 21.8 percent the previous year, 2016. (Prior to 2002, data is available only for "black" Americans. After that year, data is available for "black alone" and "black alone or in combination." We used the data for "black alone or in combination" for the period in which it is available.) Meanwhile, for Hispanics, the 2017 poverty rate was 18.3 percent, which edged out the previous record low of 19.4 percent in 2016. African-American poverty peaked at 41.8 percent in 1966. Hispanic poverty peaked at 30.7 percent in 1994. While Trump didn’t directly take credit for the decline in his Wheeling remarks, it’s worth noting that the poverty rate had fallen for several years running under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. So the pattern stems from the generally improving economy under both presidents. Our Ruling Trump said, "The poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans -- it’s been incredible, they’ve all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country." He’s right that poverty rates hit their historical lows in 2017 since the statistic was first calculated consistently in 1966. We rate the statement True.

pomt-04980	The U.S. initially had three federal felonies: treason, piracy, and counterfeiting securities and money.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/23/paul-broun/broun-claim-history-crime-gets-main-points-right/	A recent discussion about federal laws concerning online fetish videos somehow turned into a debate over the size of the U.S. Department of Justice. U.S. Rep. Paul Broun of Athens voted in 2010 against making the production of "crush videos" a federal crime. These horrific videos -- all sides agreed with that assessment -- show animals such as kittens and baby rabbits being killed. Ever since, Broun’s opponents have tried to use this vote as political ammunition. One of his rivals even claimed he sided with "sexual deviants." False, we ruled. It happened again July 2 on Athens radio station WGAU-AM 1340, on the show "Newsmakers with Tim Bryant." Broun was in the midst of an informal debate with GOP primary opponent Stephen Simpson when a caller asked the congressman to explain his vote on crush videos. Broun said making the videos was a "heinous act." But he said there was no need for a federal law. States already ban them. Furthermore, the federal government has already created more laws than the Constitution allows it to do, he said. "Initially, we only had three federal felonies, I believe. It was treason, piracy, and counterfeiting securities and money," Broun said. Only three? Tell us more, Congressman Broun. He didn’t. His office did not return our messages. So we put on our tricorn hat and knickers and took the Truth-O-Meter on a trip into history. We interviewed six legal historians with knowledge of early U.S. law. They told us that Broun’s statement broached the truth but contained some inaccuracies. The U.S. Constitution doesn’t contain an exhaustive list of federal crimes. It does mention three of them: counterfeiting federal coins and securities, piracy and felonies committed on the high seas, and treason -- the ones that Broun mentioned. But the Constitution is no criminal code, said Robert W. Gordon, a Stanford law professor and an expert on American legal history. "It doesn't create or provide for the punishment of any crimes -- it just gives authority to the Legislature [Congress] to define and punish various crimes," Gordon said. The nation’s first Congress took this authority and ran with it. The Act of April 30, 1790, otherwise known as the Crimes Act, codified those three federal offenses and declared others. We read the act and found these additional crimes included committing murder in places under federal jurisdiction, concealing federal crimes and aiding crime on the high seas. People who falsified records of proceedings in U.S. courts were to be "whipped not exceeding thirty-nine stripes," it said. The Crimes Act made perjury punishable by "standing in the pillory for one hour." Those convicted were banned from testifying in court. In other words, the first Congress did not assume the three crimes mentioned in the Constitution were the only ones it could establish, said Polly J. Price, an Emory University law professor and expert on American legal history. On the whole, however, historians thought that Broun’s omissions were important, but not fatal flaws. "I would say that Representative Broun's claim was pretty nearly accurate, since the major crimes defined in 1790 are the ones he lists; just not completely accurate, because Congress also created a few more crimes at the same time," Gordon said. How do we rule? Broun’s list was a dozen or so crimes short. But his overarching point is correct. When America was in its infancy, very few federal crimes existed. Broun earns a Mostly True.

pomt-07074	"Hispanic unemployment has been ticking down from an all-time high of 13.9 percent because of the policies we’ve implemented."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/27/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-hispanic-unemployment-ticking-down/	During an online chat with the Washington Post on June 22, 2011, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was asked about unemployment among Hispanics. A questioner asked, "Sen. Reid, Hispanic unemployment is currently 11.1 percent, vs. 9.1 percent the national average. What have/are Democrats doing to generate jobs in our community?" Reid responded, "Just this week in Las Vegas, we inaugurated a transportation center at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Hispanics make up a large portion of the Nevada labor force. And the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which we passed last Congress, provides additional tools to protect Latinos from job discrimination. Hispanic unemployment has been ticking down from an all-time high of 13.9 percent because of the policies we’ve implemented. But we want to accelerate this trend. ..." We wondered whether Reid was correct that "Hispanic unemployment has been ticking down from an all time high of 13.9 percent because of the policies we’ve implemented." We see four checkable facts within this sentence. We’ll take them one by one: Is 13.9 percent unemployment for Hispanics the highest rate ever? No. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for Hispanics -- the measure economists typically use, and which has been calculated since 1973 -- it exceeded that level once in 1975 (14.3 percent) and 12 times during the 1982-1983 recession, reaching as high as 15.7 percent. In fact, Hispanic unemployment ran higher than 13.9 percent for an entire year, from July 1982 to June 1983. Did Hispanic unemployment reach 13.9 percent after the onset of the recent recession? Again, no. It reached as high as 13.2 percent in November 2010. Has Hispanic unemployment "been ticking down" in recent months? It depends on your definition of "ticking down." If you start from the November unemployment 2010 peak -- seven months ago -- it’s fallen from 13.2 percent to 11.9 percent. That supports Reid’s view. However, it’s taken a zig-zagging route to get there. In fact, the last three months of that time period -- March, April and May 2011 -- have shown an upward trend, from 11.3 percent to 11.8 percent to 11.9 percent. Looking at those numbers, you could easily argue that Hispanic unemployment is now ticking upward. Is it appropriate to say that whatever change there has been in Hispanic unemployment is "because of the policies we’ve implemented"? As we’ve argued before, attributing credit or blame for employment statistics is a tricky business. Presidential and congressional actions have some effect, but broader economic factors -- from the global economic picture to energy prices to the state of private credit markets -- play a significant role. Complicating matters further is the question of when to draw the line. Hispanic unemployment rose over the course of 2009 from 9.9 percent to 12.8 percent, and in 2010 from 12.5 percent to 13.0 percent. How do you balance these Hispanic unemployment rate increases -- when Obama had Democratic control of both chambers of Congress -- with the arguably more favorable pattern since the 2010 elections, when the Republicans won control of the House? Because of the trickiness surrounding this question, we feel it’s a stretch for Reid to ascribe credit to the Democrats for recent Hispanic job gains -- if, in fact, you conclude that there was any "ticking down" of Hispanic unemployment in the first place. Reid’s office defended its statistics. For starters, they said they were using non-seasonally-adjusted statistics -- raw numbers published by BLS that are not tweaked to account for cyclical variations across the span of a calendar year. So we checked those too. Using these numbers, Reid is right that 13.9 percent is the peak number since the last recession began (in January 2010). But that still isn’t the record -- Hispanic unemployment went as high as 16.9 percent in February 1983 using non-seasonally-adjusted numbers. How about the trendlines? The pattern since the start of 2010 has zig-zagged a bit, but since the start of 2011, the rate has indeed ticked down -- from 13.2 percent to 12.5 percent to 11.9 percent to 11.2 percent and finally to 11.1 percent in May. So that provides some support for Reid’s claim. But is it really fair to use non-seasonally adjusted numbers? We asked Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. He noted that Reid’s questioner used a non-seasonally adjusted number when he noted that Hispanic unemployment was currently at 11.1 percent. But Burtless added that Reid should not have followed the questioner’s lead in using non-seasonally-adjusted rates -- because they are not appropriate for longterm, multi-month comparisons. Burtless said it’s acceptable to use non-seasonally-adjusted numbers when comparing, say, January 2010 to January 2011, or comparing black unemployment in January 2011 to Hispanic unemployment in January 2011. But once you start comparing figures from different months, you need to use seasonally adjusted figures to get an accurate assessment. In the context of Reid’s exchange, Burtless said, seasonally adjusted numbers "provide the most informative and useful kind of comparison." Based on such advice, we think it is misleading for Reid to use non-seasonally-adjusted numbers. As for the question of whether Democratic policies helped bring down Hispanic unemployment, Reid’s office argued that there’s a disproportionately large number of Hispanics in the construction industry, and given that the Democratic-backed stimulus bill invested in construction projects, Hispanics should have benefited disproportionately. That may be true, but if so, those job gains should have been reflected in the broader unemployment rate pattern. And as we’ve noted, the trendlines in those statistics are mixed. So where does this leave us? It’s problematic that Reid used an inappropriate measurement of unemployment, that he ignored a significantly worse recession for Hispanic employment in 1982-1983 and that he exaggerated the impact that Democratic policies have had on the Hispanic jobs picture. On the upside for Reid, Hispanic unemployment is now lower than it was in late 2010 or than it was a year or two ago, though the number has bounced around, and unemployment has risen incrementally over the past three months. The big-picture decrease in Hispanic unemployment provides enough evidence for Reid to salvage a rating of Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2011-06-27T10:50:10	2011-06-22	['None']
pomt-07466	"If you go strictly by the numbers, crime is down across the board. Last year we had a 10 percent decrease in the most serious crimes."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/18/george-turner/atlanta-police-chief-says-despite-fears-crime-down/	Worried about burglars kicking in your door and swiping your stuff? If you live in Atlanta city limits, you might find some comfort in crime statistics. The numbers are down, Atlanta Police Chief George Turner said. "If you go strictly by the numbers, crime is down across the board. Last year we had a 10 percent decrease in the most serious crimes," Turner said in an April 4 article. "But perception means everything. Until our citizens feel safe, our work is not done," Turner added. Ten percent? What about that November crime spree that left one man dead in a Virginia-Highland robbery? Police said the gang was responsible for other crimes, including a home invasion, rape and robbery in Grant Park. Many city dwellers don’t think they’re any safer, according to a survey released April 4 by the Atlanta Police Foundation, a nonprofit that assists the Atlanta Police Department by providing resources and programs. Some 34 percent of respondents thought crime in their neighborhood was at least somewhat higher than it was five years ago. PolitiFact Georgia cruised the APD website, which posts crime statistics. Its crime map page said murder more than doubled from 2009 through 2010. That didn’t seem consistent with Turner’s statement. We alerted department spokesman Carlos Campos, who said they were incorrect and had them taken down from the website. (The statistics on their crime map page did not match up with federal numbers, so we accept the spokesman’s explanation.) The spokesman then directed us to the department’s official crime tallies, known as Uniform Crime Reports. The Federal Bureau of Investigation collects these figures from police agencies across the nation. Turner based his statement on data for seven types of crime: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. Because these crimes are usually well-reported, experts think these statistics are a good reflection of the actual number of offenses taking place on the streets. We checked the numbers and found that they confirm what Turner said. Overall crime in these categories is down 10.2 percent. Crime is down in all categories except for murder, which increased from 80 killings in 2009 to 93 in 2010. Campos said that last year was only the third time since 1963 that there were fewer than 100, and that murders are trending downward. The drop in crime is part of a broader trend. While some robbery, burglary, auto theft and larceny ticked upward for a time starting in 2007, crime in Atlanta during the past decade is down about by 30 percent. Since 2001, murder in Atlanta is down 35 percent. Robbery declined 50 percent. Nationally, violent crime decreased about 7.5 percent. Another statistic experts use to assess crime is the number of offenses per capita. Recent census figures showed that Atlanta’s population is far lower than estimates -- about 22 percent lower. Still, since incidents are down and the population rose slightly, crimes per capita have also declined -- though the figure is higher than previously thought. Chief Turner was named as interim head of the APD in December 2009, shortly after Kasim Reed was elected as mayor, and won the post officially in July. He told PolitiFact Georgia that his force is more closely focused on quality-of-life issues, making arrests and enforcing traffic laws to root out more serious crime such as car thefts. That said, the city’s crime statistics are difficult to cross-check, experts told PolitiFact Georgia. Independent researchers or agencies don’t typically perform separate tallies or check the quality of crime statistics. This can be a problem, said Lou Arcangeli, a retired APD deputy chief who teachers at Georgia State University. He criticized the department earlier in the decade for posting bogus figures. "It’s an organization with a history of under-reporting crime," Arcangeli said. For a period starting in 1999, the department failed to count about 6 percent of rape reports. In 2003, an audit found that police were unable to find about 20,000 reports from the prior year. Rapes and robberies went unreported in the late 1990s as well. So we dug deeper. We looked at a 2008 Georgia Bureau of Investigation audit of the agency’s crime statistics reporting, plus a 2010 quality assurance check. Of the nearly 170 offenses checked in the 2008 audit, the GBI found two incidents that were not reported according to FBI guidelines. Still, both checks found that the APD met federal standards. We also contacted residents on the city's west side, which has struggled with crime. Residents in the West End, which pays off-duty police officers for extra security, and in the neighborhood surrounding Booker T. Washington High School, which does not, feel their streets are safer, though larcenies, car theft and prostitution persist in some areas. "I feel much better about what we see," said Bill Cannon, head of the Booker T. Washington Community Association and Neighborhood Watch. As Turner said, "strictly by the numbers" crime is down in Atlanta. Those numbers appear to reflect what is going on in area neighborhoods, and there is no evidence that the agency is improperly reporting its crime statistics. We therefore rule Turner’s statement True.	None	George Turner	None	None	None	2011-04-18T06:00:00	2011-04-04	['None']
pomt-03306	"More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/29/don-lemon/cnns-don-lemon-says-more-72-percent-african-americ/	In the middle of a national conversation about race following the George Zimmerman acquittal, CNN anchor Don Lemon gave an on-air commentary that went viral on social media. The focus of the commentary was a five-point list of recommendations. "Black people," Lemon said, "if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing." The No. 1 item on that list -- "and probably the most important," he said -- had to do with out-of-wedlock births. "Just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should," Lemon said. "Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues." Lemon’s commentary inspired a firestorm of criticism on social media -- the website Mediaite published a sampling -- and bloggers took aim at his conclusions. "If Lemon really wanted to help the black community, he could start by adopting a deeper understanding of the history, sociology and psychology of his own people," wrote Washington Post blogger Rahiel Tesfamariam. "Offering made-for-TV analysis about deeply complex social issues in the manner in which he did is irresponsible and lacks intellectual rigor." We can’t check Lemon’s opinions, but we did want to take a look at the one verifiable fact he offered. Is it correct that "more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock"? We turned to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes a report every year that includes a wealth of data about births in America. The most recent report, published in August 2012, is based on data from 2010. The report broke down statistics by ethnic groups. Here’s a summary Racial or ethnic group Percent of births considered "non-marital" Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 17 percent Non-Hispanic whites 29 percent Hispanics 53 percent American Indian and Native Alaskans 66 percent Non-Hispanic blacks 73 percent So Lemon is correct that "more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock." To make sure we weren’t missing something, we asked two population experts -- Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, and Douglas Massey, professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research -- and they agreed that the statistic is the best available. Lemon did overreach somewhat when he went on to say that the 72 percent "out of wedlock" figure "means absent fathers." The 72 percent figure refers to children who are born to women who are not married; it would, however, include unmarried couples in which the father is present. That said, the rate of African-American children living in single-parent homes is almost as high as the rate for non-marital births. The chart below summarizes 2011 Census Bureau data compiled by Kids Count, a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The group defined "children in single-parent families" as kids under 18 who live with their own single parent; it includes children living with a parent and a cohabiting adult, but it does not include children living with married step-parents. Racial or ethnic group Children in single-parent families Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 17 percent Non-Hispanic whites 25 percent Hispanics 42 percent American Indian and Native Alaskans 53 percent Non-Hispanic blacks 67 percent We should note that this data doesn’t suggest that 67 percent of African-American children have no contact with their father (or a father figure), but rather that their father does not live in the same household with them. Our ruling Lemon said that "more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock." Federal data confirms that 73 percent of African-American births in 2010 were out of wedlock. Estimates for the percentage of African-American children growing up in single-parent households are slightly lower, at 67 percent. Finally, black children counted in these statistics may have contact outside the household with their biological father. But Lemon's statistic was accurate, and we rate his statement True.

pomt-13746	Says "Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization" of the Veterans Administration.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/tim-kaine/does-donald-trump-want-privatize-va/	For all of Donald Trump’s talk about veterans, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said he doesn’t have their backs. Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential pick, blasted Trump on MSNBC for his "not a war hero" comments about John McCain, his delay in donating to veterans charities, and his ideas for fixing the Veterans Administration. "Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization of the V.A.," Kaine said July 11. "That is something that is overwhelmingly rejected by America's veterans. They do not want to go down that path. Do they want improvement? Sure they do. But they don't want risky or radical." To back up his claim, the Kaine camp pointed to Trump’s campaign page on V.A. reforms and articles suggesting privatization is among them. But the Trump campaign told us Trump’s plan simply gives veterans a choice, and that’s not the same thing as privatization. While Trump wants to give veterans access to health providers outside the V.A. system, Kaine is being overly simplistic by suggesting Trump wants to turn over the whole thing to the private sector. What Trump proposed Trump’s VA plans include some elements of privatization, but it isn’t an outright overhaul of the existing system. At an October 2015 rally in Virginia, Trump said even though some candidates want to get rid of the V.A. (possibly referring to Ben Carson’s proposals to give veterans health savings accounts) he wants to "supplement" the existing V.A. system for veterans. "No, it doesn’t have to be privatization," Trump said at a May 2016 press conference. "What it has to be is when somebody is online and they say it’s a seven-day wait, that person’s going to walk across the street to a private doctor, be taken care of, we’re gonna pay the bill." Nowhere on his position page or in his July 2016 Virginia Beach speech on veterans issues does Trump propose privatizing the V.A. Instead, he seeks to modernize it, crack down on inefficiency and abuse, and provide more care for female vets and those in in rural areas. He does, however, propose a veterans ID card for use outside of the V.A. system on his campaign website: "Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran’s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately. ...The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans’ health care dollars." Similarly, Trump floated the idea in his speech in Virginia: "We are going to ensure every veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the V.A., or to seek private medical care paid for by our government." According to the Trump campaign, this is essentially the recommendation of the bipartisan federal Commission on Care, but with more choice in doctors. But veterans groups (many of which support the commission’s recommendations) told us that’s not an entirely accurate comparison. In short, the commission plan folds private health care providers into the V.A. system, while the Trump plan allows veterans to opt out of it. In its 300-page report, the commission emphasized that the V.A. should have oversight over an integrated health care network by vetting, training and coordinating with private sector doctors and clinics that qualify for participation. Trump’s plan, again, gives veterans access to all Medicare providers, but it doesn’t specify that these non-V.A. doctors would have to coordinate or meet the standards of the V.A. The I.D. card proposal also bears some resemblance to the Veterans Choice program, a law sponsored by John McCain that gives veterans access to community providers if they’ve been waiting for more than 30 days for V.A. care or if they live more than 40 miles away from a V.A. facility. Trump’s plan would essentially get rid of these eligibility requirements. Trump advisor Sam Clovis did tell the Wall Street Journal the candidate might model V.A. care after Medicare (like an insurance provider), as the Kaine campaign pointed out, but Clovis also said Trump "doesn’t want to take away the veterans hospitals and the things that are working out." Not exactly privatization Veterans group agreed that Trump’s I.D. card plan would lead to more privatized care, but were divided on whether Kaine’s characterization of Trump’s plan was accurate. Paralyzed Veterans of America’s executive director Sherman Gillums Jr. criticized Trump’s proposal for "completely privatizing" the V.A. in a press release, but praised Trump’s attention to veterans issues. AMVETS spokesman John Hoellwarth called the proposal "well-intentioned," but agreed that it was privatization and would be disastrous. "Encouraging all veterans to seek care in the private sector, which lacks the expertise to treat military and combat injuries and illnesses, and which does not typically provide integrated or coordinated care, would lead to worse health outcomes for many veterans," Hoellwarth said. Veterans of Foreign Wars, meanwhile, considers the Trump’s idea partial privatization. "Our concern is that a ‘go anywhere card’ leads to veterans receiving fragmented, uncoordinated, and lower-quality care, which is not what veterans have earned and deserve," said Joe Davis, the group’s director of public affairs. "Private sector health care must complement, not compete with or supplant the VA health care system." On the other end, Dan Caldwell, vice president for political and legislative action at Concerned Veterans for America (which is backed by the anti-Trump Koch brothers) said the group supports both choice and integration and disagreed vehemently with Kaine’s characterization. "Giving veterans the choice of where to use their VA benefits does not necessitate the sale of VA hospitals to corporations nor does it eliminate government control of veterans’ health care," Caldwell said. "Calling expanded health care choice for veterans ‘privatization’ is simply a poll-tested scare tactic." Our ruling Kaine said, "Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization of the V.A." Actually, Trump is a guy who has called for giving veterans access to private providers. That may lead some veterans to seek care outside the V.A., but it’s not the same thing as completely privatizing the system. We rate Kaine’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-03471	"This president spends 30 times as much money on global warming research as he does on weather forecasting and warning."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/14/jim-bridenstine/rep-jim-bridenstine-says-us-spends-30-times-much-c/	Freshman Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla., attracted some attention for a House floor speech on June 11, 2013, in which he said he’s ready to accept President Barack Obama’s "apology" for spending too much on climate change research. In his one-minute speech, Bridenstine -- whose state has been hard-hit by severe tornadoes in recent weeks -- expressed skepticism that human activity has historically caused either global warming or cooling. He went on to say the following: "Here’s what we absolutely know. We know that Oklahoma will have tornadoes when the cold jet stream meets the warm gulf air. And we also know that this president spends 30 times as much money on global warming research as he does on weather forecasting and warning. For this gross misallocation, the people of Oklahoma are ready to accept the president’s apology, and I intend to submit legislation to fix this." We wondered whether Bridenstine is right that Obama spends 30 times as much on global warming research as on weather forecasting and warning. Bridenstine’s office provided us with support for his claim. For the climate change figure, they used Obama’s fiscal year 2014 request for $2.7 billion for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which cuts across 13 federal agencies. For the weather-forecasting figure, they used $81.6 million for weather and air chemistry research under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the parent agency of the National Weather Service. Comparing these two figures works out to a 33-to-1 ratio, in line with what Bridenstine said. But there are two key problems with this calculation. He didn’t specify that he was talking about weather research Bridenstine said that Obama "spent more on "weather forecasting and warning," not "weather forecasting and warning research." That’s just one word, but it makes a big difference, because the National Weather Service spends a whole lot more on operations -- "forecasting and warning" -- than it does on research. Obama’s National Weather Service budget request for 2014 was $1.05 billion, split about 90 percent for operations and research and 10 percent for construction and acquisition. That means the ratio between climate research and "forecasting and warning" would be about 2.7 to 1 -- far less than the 30-to-1 ratio Bridenstine cited. Bridenstine’s office vigorously disagreed with this interpretation, arguing that the "whole topic" of his speech was research, as is the subject of his forthcoming legislation. However, Bridenstine’s words didn’t make clear that he’s making a comparison only to weather research. It sounds like he’s comparing climate change research to weather "forecasting and warning." Indeed, the only time he said the word "research" in the brief speech was in relation to climate change. Did Bridenstine count all of the weather research he could have? Now, for the sake of argument, let’s look at Bridenstine’s claim as if he had said "forecasting and warning research." Is his comparison valid? Experts we checked with didn’t have any quibbles with his $2.7 billion figure for climate change. But they did say he’s overlooking some weather research funding being conducted by agencies other than the National Weather Service or its parent, NOAA. One expert pointed us to a document issued by a federal committee that is charged with ensuring "the effective use of federal meteorological resources" by coordinating needs among various agencies. One of the document’s tables summarizes meteorological "research and development costs by budget category" for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior and Transportation, plus the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This table offers $1.25 billion as the total figure for federal meteorological research and development in 2013. If we were to use this figure, then the money spent on climate change research would be slightly more than twice as big. That’s still a gap, but it’s well below a ratio of 30 to 1. Bridenstine’s office counters that it’s not fair to use this figure for computing the ratio. They noted that some categories might be far from helpful in domestic weather forecasting, such as Defense Department projects focused on weather overseas. And they noted, correctly, that about $900 million of the $1.25 billion figure falls under NASA, and that some of the projects NASA is involved in addresses, according to the report, "biodiversity, cryospheric science, remote sensing of water quality, atmospheric composition, and interdisciplinary science," as well as "global and regional climate change" -- topics far afield from weather forecasting. Still, NASA has a long record of working with, and covering some of the costs for, the National Weather Service, particularly on pricey satellite programs. For instance, the GPM Core Observatory is in the final stages of testing at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, with a launch planned for 2014. This project is designed to provide "near-real-time" data on precipitation, and one of its goals is "improved weather forecasting." Other collaborative programs between NASA and NOAA include the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite and Polar Operational Environmental Satellite, which will offer "real-time weather data for use in short-term weather forecasting," and the Joint Polar Satellite System, which is designed to enable scientists to "better predict medium- and long-term weather." When we asked meteorological experts, most said Bridenstine’s ratio was at least somewhat misleading. For one thing, it’s hard to draw clear lines between climate and weather research and to remove all sources of overlap from the comparison. For instance, research into El Nino events, which have a big impact on localized weather, could be categorized as either "climate" or "weather." "Substantial overlap exists in weather forecasting and climate research," said Eric D. Maloney, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. "One hot topic in our field at the moment is ‘seamless’ predictions that link weather and climate. This has applications for the prediction of hurricane activity in the Atlantic on seasonal and sub-seasonal timescales." Rob Jackson, an environmental scientist at Duke University, called Bridenstine’s comparison "silly." "The number for climate change research combines a score of federal agencies, all of them pooled together," he said. "The number for weather forecasting and warning is for one and only one program within one federal agency. It’s a selective distortion of actual spending." Regardless of what ratio you ultimately settle on, Iowa State University meteorologist William Gallus said Bridenstine does deserve credit for putting his finger on an issue that "simmers behind the scenes in my profession" -- the idea that climate-change funding has elbowed out weather forecasting funding. In particular, he said weather scientists sometimes chafe at the computing resources available to climate-change scientists. While this discrepancy may have roots in the greater computational power needed to model the long-term global climate, he added that meteorologists "could really benefit from more powerful computers that allow us to run the models with far finer resolution to actually be able to simulate the tornadoes themselves." Our ruling Bridenstine said Obama "spends 30 times as much money on global warming research as he does on weather forecasting and warning." We think the most obvious way to read his words is to compare climate-change research funding with dollars spent on "weather forecasting and warning," which produces a 2.7-to-1 ratio. However, even if you accept Bridenstine’s argument that he meant to compare it to "weather forecasting and warning research," the ratio is still not near 30 to 1. Bridenstine does have a point that climate change research exceeds weather forecasting expenditures, but he’s overstated the discrepancy. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-05670	"In 1950, the average American lived for 68 years and 16 workers supported one retiree. Today, the average life expectancy is 78 and three workers support one retiree."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/16/frank-wolf/rep-frank-wolf-says-fewer-workers-are-supporting-m/	U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf said the longevity of Americans is placing a strain on Social Security. "In 1950, the average American lived for 68 years and 16 workers supported one retiree. Today, the average life expectancy is 78 and three workers support one retiree," Wolf said on Feb. 17 before voting against a 10-month extension of the Social Security payroll tax credit. We wondered whether Wolf was correct about the life expectancy tallies and the ratio of the number workers supporting each Social Security recipient. Let’s start with life expectancy: A 2006 Congressional Research Service report said that from 1949 to 1951, the U.S. life expectancy was 68.1 years. The most recent data from the Centers for Disease control show that in 2010, the average life expectancy was 78.7 years old. So Wolf is right on this front. What about the numbers of workers supporting a Social Security recipient? Dan Scandling, Wolf’s spokeman, pointed to an April 2011 fact-check from our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia that examined a similar claim made by Mark Warner, D-Va., about the worker-to-retiree ratio in 1950 compared with today. The story referenced historical data from the 2010 Social Security Trustees report. We looked at the latest trustees report from 2011 to get the ratio of workers to retirees on Social Security. In 1950, there were 48.28 million workers paying into the system and 2.93 million receiving benefits. That works out to 16.5 employees for every Social Security recipient back then. In 2011, the latest year in which data was available, there were 157.8 million workers paying into Social Security and nearly 55 million receiving benefits. That comes to 2.9 workers for every retiree, close to Wolf’s number. The decline in the ratio is driven by a number of factors. Henry Aaron, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in the early years of the system, many workers such as farmers and state and local employees weren’t eligible to receive benefits. Over the decades, more people from more professions have been admitted into the system. In the 1950s and 1960s, the eligibility age to receive Social Security payments was lowered from 65 to 62. And basic demographics are at play. "The ratio changed because Americans are living longer and retiring earlier," Bob Pozen, a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said in an e-mail. "Moreover, the baby boomers -- a big demographic wave -- are starting to retire." The Social Security Administration, in its 2011 trustees report, projected that unless changes are made, trust funds supporting the system will be exhausted in 2036 and full benefits would no longer be paid on a timely basis. That doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to deal with the projected shortfall. For the system to remain whole for the next 75 years, the Social Security Administration suggests the payroll tax into the system could be increased, benefits could be reduced, or some combination of the two approaches could be implemented. Our ruling Wolf said that 60 years ago, the average life expectancy was 68 years at a time when 16 workers supported each retiree on Social Security. Today, he said, the life expectancy is 78 and three workers support one retiree. He’s right on the numbers and highlighting a demographic challenge the Social Security Administration acknowledges is placing greater demands on the system. His statement is True.

pomt-06412	Says judges "get better benefits at a lower cost than everybody else in the state."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/27/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-judges-reap-better-pension-b/	Gov. Chris Christie has handed down his ruling: fork it over, judges. In a fight over whether judges are required to pay more toward pension and health benefits as required by a law passed this summer, Christie has blasted the state's judiciary as protecting its own wallet as other public employees ante up. "Everyone who has the privilege of a public pension should pay their fair share for their public pension. That's all this is about. And the courts now try to muck this up to make it about judicial independence. I want the judiciary to be independent," Christie said during a Tuesday press conference. "I just don't want them to be a part of an elite, special class of citizens who get better benefits at a lower cost than everybody else in the state and do that at the expense of the taxpayers. It simply doesn't make sense." State Superior Court Assignment Judge Linda Feinberg ruled last week that judges are exempt from the new law because it amounts to a pay cut, which the state Constitution forbids for the judiciary. Christie has appealed the judge’s decision and called for a constitutional amendment to circumvent it. He also tied the issue to the Nov. 8 election, calling on candidates vying for the 120 legislative seats up for grabs to choose a side on whether judges should pay more. As the debate continues in the courts and the state capital, PolitiFact New Jersey checked Christie’s claim that judges reap more from the pension system than they sow. We found Christie is right. Among the five major pension funds covering public workers in New Jersey, recent retirees in the judicial pension system collected the largest average annual benefit and contributed the smallest percentage of their salaries, prior to the new pension reform law. The amount public employees collect in pension benefits depends on a variety of factors, including their occupation, salary and years of service. We should also note that most public workers receive subsidized health benefits in retirement. Public school employees, state police and the judiciary branch each have a pension fund. Police and firefighters have a retirement system and other public employees belong to the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or PERS. New retirees -- those who have retired in the year preceding July 1, 2010 -- from the judicial pension system collected an average annual pension benefit of $107,540, the largest among the state pension funds in that category. The same types of retirees in the state police pension fund collected $65,232. New, local retirees in PERS collected $17,599, the smallest amount among the funds in that category. Before the pension law that passed this summer, judges contributed 3 percent of their salaries toward their pensions, the smallest percentage among public employees. Members of the state police pension fund contributed 7.5 percent and members of PERS contributed 5.5 percent. Under the new law, the amount judges pay toward their pensions jumps, over a seven year period, from 3 percent to 12 percent of their salary, the largest percentage compared with the contribution rates of members of other pension funds. Our ruling Christie, during a news conference on judicial pensions, said judges "get better benefits at a lower cost than everybody else in the state." The average annual pension benefit for new retirees in the judicial pension system is the largest. And judges contributed, prior to the pension and benefit reform law, 3 percent of their salary toward their pension, the smallest percentage among public employees. We rate Christie’s statement True.

pomt-05770	About 800 people refused to get a drug screening because they are "out there on drugs."	false	/florida/statements/2012/feb/28/paige-kreegel/about-800-people-refused-get-drug-screening-becaus/	Florida leaders are reviving failed efforts to require drug tests of people who get taxpayer money. The Legislature ordered drug-testing of welfare recipients in 2011, but a federal judge halted the program. Gov. Rick Scott ordered random testing of state employees within his purview, but he suspended the tests in June 2011 after another legal challenge. Regardless of the lawsuits, state lawmakers are still trying to put drug-testing for state employees into law. To bolster support of HB 1205, lawmakers discussed on Feb. 15, 2012, the results of their drug-testing initiative for welfare recipients. During a committee hearing, Rep. Paige Kreegel, R-Punta Gorda, said he read in a newspaper that only 83 people who applied for temporary cash assistance from the state failed the required drug screening. The number is low, he said, but there are hundreds more who are on drugs but were deterred by the drug screening. (Kreegel, by the way, has said he intends to run for the U.S. House of Representatives later this year.) "In the last line they (newspapers) do admit that there are about 800 and some people who refuse to take the drug test," he said, "which tells me if you add 'em all together there's 1,000 people out there on drugs. Nine out of ten of them are smart enough not to take the drug test." He went on to say people would have used the money on drugs "and now they're not." We were struck by Kreegel’s numbers and assumptions. Is there evidence to back it up? Kreegel’s reasoning Kreegel defended his statements when we reached him by phone. "I think it is a fairly safe assumption that a person would refuse to take a urine drug test because they were afraid of being caught with drugs," Kreegel said. The drug test is the final requirement to receive temporary cash assistance, or TANF as it’s called, after the agency verifies an applicant's income, background, child support and ID. Applicants pay an average of $35 for the test up front and are reimbursed by the state if they pass. We're not sure where Kreegel learned that 80 or so people failed the test, or that 800 or so people declined to take it, though he said it was from a newspaper story. We found several stories that measured the requirement’s effectiveness throughout its tenure, but they didn’t use those numbers. Let’s take it one step at a time. Who failed the test: Kreegel’s figure of about 80 failed tests is not far from the tally over four months of practice, according to the Department of Children and Families, which administers the TANF program. He actually underestimated it. Of the 4,086 applicants who scheduled drug tests, 108 people failed their tests, a fail rate of 2.6 percent, according to DCF. About 1 percent of applicants, or 42, scheduled tests but canceled them. About 96.3 percent of applicants passed the screenings. The high pass rate means the state paid out more than $100,000 in reimbursements to applicants who passed over the four-month period. Who started their application but didn’t take the test: Kreegel said 800 or so people walked away before taking the drug test. The department reported a number nearly three times as high -- 2,306. We asked the department if it had any way to know why people didn’t take the test. "There is no way to determine why someone did not take the test," said Joe Follick, DCF spokesman. "We did not have the capacity or legal authority to survey each applicant's decision-making process." Other reasons someone might not take a drug test The American Civil Liberties Union has sued the state against the drug policy on behalf of Luis Lebron, an Orlando student and a Navy veteran. Derek Newton, an ACLU spokesperson, said there were many reasons people might apply for benefits and then not take the drug tests. They might not have enough money to pay for the tests up front and wait for state reimbursement. They might find a job in the meantime and not need benefits. They might leave the state for work or for personal reasons. They might qualify for other benefits that make them ineligible for the program. They might be unable to find a nearby testing center. Lebron refused to comply with the drug-testing requirement, arguing it was an unreasonable search because there wasn’t a reason to assume he was on drugs. The judge who issued the temporary injunction agreed with him, writing in her order, "The constitutional rights of a class of citizen are at stake." In a subsequent discussion of the state-employee drug testing bill, Kreegel repeated the gist of his assumption that applicants did not take the test because they were on drugs. "People made allusions to the fact that … a very small percentage of people tested positive," he said Feb. 21, 2012. "But the rest of the truth in that story is that about 10 percent of the people who refused a drug test didn’t receive welfare. I personally believe that those would-be welfare recipients were probably not concerned as much about their constitutional rights as they were about the possibility that would test positive. So I think in that case we saved our voters from subsidizing drug abuse." Our ruling Let's review. Kreegel said about 80 people failed a 2011 drug screening requirement to receive welfare, and about 800 more applied for benefits but refused to be screened because they are "out there on drugs." One of our principles for fact-checking is that people have to have evidence for what they say. In this case, Kreegel doesn’t have evidence to back up that statement. Meanwhile, drug-testing opponents have offered a number of other reasons why someone might not want take a drug test. And the department that administers the tests can't say why people don't take it. Kreegel's numbers are also off. They’re actually higher than he stated, as 108 people failed the test and 2,306 applied for benefits but did not take the test. So Kreegel gets the numbers wrong. But more importantly, he makes a blanket statement about people who don't take the test being on drugs, when evidence doesn't exist. We rate his claim False.

pomt-01273	2014 midterm election spending by "the left and the right are both equal."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/06/joe-scarborough/which-side-spent-more-2014-midterms-democrats-or-r/	Rare was the recent commercial break not dominated by negative TV ads this cycle, a nasty byproduct of record piles of money thrown at competitive races across the country. The money poured in from candidates, parties, super PACs and "dark money" groups that don’t have to report their donors, and also individual donors like you (though your influence is waning, sorry). On the eve of Election Day, MSNBC Morning Joe co-host Joe Scarborough and guest economist Jeffrey Sachs argued about whether the left or the right had more dough in what Sachs called the "billionaire’s election." Most of the money will be well-disguised, with huge sums coming from private oil and gas companies, Sachs said, singling out millions of dollars in contributions from billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. Scarborough was not having this argument. "Jeff, you just can't say that," Scarborough said. "You can look at the numbers, and the left and the right are both equal. It’s like the arms race between the Soviets and the Americans. It’s equal. You can say ‘big oil’ all you want to, that’s just not factually accurate." Sachs replied that the Koch brothers alone have probably put $300 million into the election. Scarborough said, "You always talk about oil and gas when in fact there are environmentalists on the left that are putting in millions and millions," a reference to liberal super PAC donor Tom Steyer. "Add up all the money, right now, it’s about equal on both sides," Scarborough said. Though the back-and-forth came before the votes were counted, we think it’s worth revisiting as a last homage to all those TV ads. The basic question: Who spent more, the right or the left? Understanding the playing field The problem in declaring a winner in the spending race, and also in the argument between Scarborough and Sachs, is the American political system makes it difficult to ultimately calculate just who spent what, on what. That hurts Scarborough’s assertion that spending on the left and right in 2014 was equal, because the claim is largely rooted in conjecture. Moreover, what facts do exist tend to undercut Scarborough’s claim. The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan Washington group whose job is to track political spending, estimates that candidates, parties, committees, outside groups and donors will spend at least $3.67 billion on the 2014 midterm elections, $40 million more than what was spent in 2010. According to the center, "Team Red," code for Republican-aligned groups, will have spent about $1.75 billion across the country by the time all the bills are paid. "Team Blue," Democratic-aligned groups, will spend $110 million less, about $1.64 billion. The remainder of the money comes from groups that wouldn’t fit into one box or the other. The difference between both sides is a significant chunk of change, but it’s not like "the Republicans are wiping the floor with the Democrats," said center research director Sarah Bryner. Put another way, if spending were an election, Team Red is estimated to win the cycle 47.7 percent to 44.7 percent. Some of that difference is logical. The GOP is spending more on House races, for example, because it has more seats to protect, she said. One thing to know about the center’s estimate: It does not account for money toward "issue advertisements" that run earlier in the election cycle, do not ask the public to vote a particular way and do not have to be disclosed. While there’s no reliable accounting of this kind of undisclosed spending, Bryner said some of the largest donors in this area are Koch-related nonprofit groups, which would pad the conservative number even more than it is. Can’t count dark dollars So from what we can see, experts say Republican causes slightly outspent Democratic ones in 2014. But the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation says "dark money" is a big X-factor. Dark money is a post-Citizens United term for spending by groups that do not disclose donors, which include trade associations, unions and nonprofit social welfare organizations like the Koch brothers-founded Americans for Prosperity. Sunlight Foundation managing editor Kathy Kiely says untraceable dark money is a preferred tactic of conservatives, while Democrats tend to use traceable super PACs. Take Steyer, a liberal environmental activist who poured millions of dollars into the 2014 elections attempting to unseat Republicans including Florida Gov. Rick Scott. Steyer is the single biggest contributor to super PACs in 2014 at $73 million, Kiely said. The next biggest donor is Michael Bloomberg at $20 million, who also supported Democrats in 2014. Conservatives donated to super PACs as well, but not to the same degree. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson gave about $5 million, she said. "But the question is has somebody like an Adelson completely stepped out, or is he merely giving in ways that we can’t see?" Kiely said. While Steyer’s contributions are declared because he gave to super PACs, there’s not as much certainty on the other side of the ledger. The Sunlight Foundation has recorded about $140 million in dark money, some of which comes from business groups who want to keep donations private. These so-called dark money groups also tend to give more heavily to Republican candidates, which would hint that donors are also Republicans. It wasn’t until January 2014, for instance, that the Washington Post and the Center for Responsive Politics were able to use tax filings to detail more than $400 million in spending on the 2012 campaign by a web of 17 conservative groups spearheaded by the Koch brothers. MSNBC did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Scarborough and a guest tussled over spending in the 2014 midterms, with Scarborough saying the spending on both sides in 2014 is equal. The estimates we have say Republican-aligned groups spent more, though the estimates are somewhat close. But there is a lot of money that was spent that we cannot track. Scarborough’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Joe Scarborough	None	None	None	2014-11-06T10:40:40	2014-11-03	['None']

And that’s just the candidates who’ve grabbed the most headlines. For lesser-known candidates, distinguishing themselves has been tough. One candidate, Dr. Branko Radulovacki, a Democrat and Atlanta psychiatrist, is doing his best to emerge from the fray. Dr. Rad -- as he prefers to be called -- has been appearing everywhere, commenting on the issues in online videos, town hall meetings and through campaign emails. One such email, titled "Walking the Talk," highlights Dr. Rad’s actions. The email includes several "only" statements, touting the Atlanta doctor as being the only candidate to participate in the 50th anniversary March on Washington, the "Si se puede" immigration reform march in Atlanta and to march in Atlanta’s Pride parade. But it was his "only" statements about two controversial political topics -- Syria and the Affordable Care Act -- that intrigued us. Here are the key statements from Dr. Rad’s campaign email, emphasis his: "I’m the only one who spoke out against bombing Syria. And the only one who took on Governor Deal and Insurance Commissioner Hudgens over their efforts to ‘obstruct’ the Affordable Care Act in Georgia." With more than a dozen announced candidates in that U.S. Senate race, we were curious whether Dr. Rad’s statements were correct. Did he actually hold the "only" title on these two issues? We decided to investigate. A few months ago, international relations were strained as President Barack Obama considered taking military action against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons. Dr. Rad released a statement opposing the strikes. And at the time, many of Georgia’s leading Republicans, including those running for Senate, also denounced Obama’s plans, saying the president failed to make his case for attacking the country. PolitiFact Georgia’s research found that Peach State congressmen and Senate candidates Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey spoke out against the proposed attacks, and U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston was leaning no. And former Secretary of State Karen Handel even made a radio ad out of her opposition, and used it as an attack ad against leading Democratic challenger Michelle Nunn. On the Democratic side, former state Sen. Steen Miles also publicly opposed strikes on Syria. From our research of major announced candidates, only Nunn supported Obama’s plans. There was less political chatter surrounding Dr. Rad’s Affordable Care Act claim. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal and Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens were early opponents of Obama’s health care plan. Hudgens even bragged during the summer about being an "obstructionist" to the law. Last week, when asked about the health care plan rollout, Hudgens said he hopes the plan "implodes." Georgia chose not to expand Medicaid for low-income residents, and not to offer a state-based health care marketplace for its residents seeking health insurance coverage under the new law. Dr. Rad released a statement and video about the leaders’ "obstructionism," saying it was hurting the state. "We call on Gov. Deal and Insurance Commissioner Hudgens to STEP UP and lead, or STEP ASIDE," Rad’s statement and petition said. Last week, he applauded Hudgens for putting some helpful information about the law and insurance marketplaces on the insurance commissioner’s website. Along with Dr. Rad’s statements, we found comments from Nunn about Deal’s rejection of the Medicaid expansion and the impact on war veterans. (Nunn received a True rating from PolitiFact Georgia for her statements.) When contacted by PolitiFact Georgia, Dr. Rad reviewed the statements and admitted that his campaign email was incorrect. The doctor said that a campaign staffer in charge of composing the email unintentionally misrepresented one of Dr. Rad’s Facebook posts. That post, an open letter dated Oct. 11, detailed the ways the physician was different from the other Senate candidates. "The buck stops with me," Dr. Rad told us. "It was a mistake and I take full responsibility for that mistake. I will set the record straight." Dr. Rad promised to send out another campaign statement correcting the errors. So where does this leave us? The Atlanta physician released a campaign email that said he was the only Senate candidate to speak out against bombing Syria, and to challenge Georgia’s governor and insurance commissioner about obstructing the federal health care law. Dr. Rad is incorrect on the first point: Several Republican candidates, including current congressmen, spoke against proposed attacks on Syria. And another candidate produced a radio ad about her opposition. On the health care front, one other Democratic Senate candidate spoke out against the state’s decision not to expand Medicaid to poor residents, which was a large part of the Affordable Care Act. Dr. Rad admitted that the campaign email was incorrect and promised to correct the error. Corrections are always a good thing. But on the initial claim, the doctor gets a False.

pomt-03551	Says only 25 percent of Texas high school students graduate prepared for college or careers.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/may/24/bill-hammond/bill-hammond-says-only-25-percent-texas-high-schoo/	As the Texas Senate approved a bill to reduce state-mandated exams in public schools, business leader Bill Hammond decried the measure. Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, said, "We already graduate only 25 percent of students who are career- or college-ready. I don’t understand why many of our lawmakers are dead set on running away from strong requirements meant to increase that number and put in place standards that will do just the opposite," according to a May 6, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. Are all but a quarter of Texas high school graduates unprepared for jobs or college? Association spokesman Robert Wood emailed us an Aug. 22, 2012, report from ACT, a nonprofit organization that administers a nationwide college admissions and placement test, about Texas’ graduating class of 2012. Among the 110,180 high schoolers in Texas who took the ACT that year -- accounting for 39 percent of the graduating class, according to the report -- 24 percent met the group’s "College Readiness Benchmarks" in all four subjects tested (English, reading, math and science), compared to 25 percent nationally. Thirty-two percent of Texas test-takers hit none of the benchmarks -- or, put another way, 68 percent of the students hit at least one. ACT’s report said its benchmarks indicate preparedness for careers as well as college. Wood emailed us a March 21, 2013, Dallas Morning News interview with state higher education commissioner Raymund Paredes in which Paredes is quoted as saying ACT data show 25 percent are college-ready "across the board." The benchmarks, according to an ACT press release accompanying the report, are "based on actual grades earned in college by ACT-tested students." ACT calculates, for each subject, the minimum ACT score that indicates a student has a 75 percent chance of earning a C or a 50 percent chance of earning a B in a first-year college course in that subject, the release said. Via email, ACT spokesman Ed Colby noted that Hammond was citing the percentage of Texas graduates who missed the benchmarks in four subjects. Colby offered a less stringent measure. In ACT’s view, he said, students who hit three out of four benchmarks "still have a good chance of succeeding in college." So a student could miss one of the benchmarks without being considered by ACT "at risk of not succeeding in college and career," he said. "Last year, 40 percent of ACT-tested graduates nationally (39 percent in Texas) met at least three of our four benchmarks," Colby said. "We would argue that is a fairer figure to quote when talking about overall college and career readiness, but that is open to interpretation." Texas’ ACT benchmark results have stayed relatively steady in recent years, rising or falling by no more than four percentage points from 2008 through 2012, according to ACT. As in 2012, for instance, 24 percent of Texas’ 2011 graduates taking the ACT met all four subject-matter benchmarks and 39 percent met three or more. The College Board, a nonprofit organization that administers the SAT college admissions tests, also sets a benchmark for "college and career readiness": a score of 1550, which the board’s website says "is associated with a 65 percent probability of obtaining a first year (grade point average) of a B- or higher." Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson emailed us College Board reports for Texas showing that among students who took the SAT tests, 33 percent in the class of 2011 and 32 percent in the class of 2012 hit the benchmark. Like the ACT, SAT tests are taken not by all high school graduates but typically by students who already intend to enroll in college; 54 percent of Texas’ 2011 grads and 58 percent of 2012 grads took SATs. The state agency cites its own indicator of how well high-school graduates are prepared for college. Spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us by email, "Based on the state 2012 Academic Excellence Indicator System report, 52 percent of the class of 2011 graduates met the college-ready criteria in both ELA (English language arts) and mathematics." Time for some unpacking: In that report, Ratcliffe said, students were considered "college-ready" if they met or exceeded college criteria on one or more of three standardized tests: the ACT, the SAT or the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills exit-level test. Specifically, Ratcliffe said, the 52 percent figure represents graduates who made or exceeded certain English and math scores on the TAKS, SAT or ACT. So three varied ways of calculating suggest that 32 percent, 39 percent and 52 percent of students in recent years were prepared for college. By telephone, Hammond agreed there are other ways of measuring college readiness. Even ACT’s own data "is saying two different things," he said, referring to the four-part ACT measurement he initially cited and the three-of-four approach offered to us by the ACT spokesman. Hammond offered for perspective a statistic from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board indicating that about 30 percent of Texas high school graduates who went straight into a Texas college or university in fall 2011 needed catch-up classes in math, reading or writing. Our ruling Hammond said only 25 percent of Texas high school graduates are college- or career-ready. While there is a method behind his conclusion, even the purveyor of that figure, ACT, says it prefers a lower threshold for gauging whether students are college- or career-ready. Besides, there are at least two other indicators, one from the company that runs the SAT and the other from the state of Texas, suggesting that up to half of the state’s high-school graduates are ready for college. Hammond’s claim fails to reflect the variety of college-readiness indicators. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Bill Hammond	None	None	None	2013-05-24T06:00:00	2013-05-06	['Texas']
pomt-10971	"Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/18/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-wrong-several-counts-abou/	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist and former organizer for Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, attracted national attention after her upset primary victory over Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in a Queens- and Bronx-based district. But critics pounced on some of her remarks during an interview on the PBS show Firing Line with Margaret Hoover. During the interview, Ocasio-Cortez said, "Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family." (It’s at about 5:45 in this video.) This comment drew criticism from a number of right-leaning outlets, including the National Review, Hot Air, TownHall.com and Reason. In our review, we found many reasons why unemployment is low, and not for the overwork that Ocasio-Cortez cited. The biggest factors include strong economic confidence and the long-running economic recovery. (Her campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) "Everyone has two jobs" The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps track of how many people work two jobs rather than just one. Over the past 12 months, the number of multiple job holders has ranged between 6 million and 7 million. That compares to more than 148 million Americans who are employed in a single job. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So by the official statistics, multiple job holders account for a tiny fraction of American workers. And this percentage isn’t high by historical standards. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The percentage has moved in a pretty narrow band — 4.7 percent to 5.2 percent — during the recovery from the Great Recession. That range is actually below where it was between 1994 and the Great Recession. In fact, the percentage was at its highest (as high as 6.5 percent) during the peak of the 1990s boom. "People are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week" This assertion is equally dubious. The Bureau of Labor Statistics breaks down its count of people with multiple jobs into three categories: people working one full-time job and one part-time job; people with two part-time jobs; and people working two full-time jobs. A worker with two full-time jobs is the smallest category of the three. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Since the entire pie chart is equivalent to the small red column in the previous graph, the people who might be working 70 or 80 hours a week amount to a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage — 310,000 people at most in a pool of employed Americans totaling more than 150 million. It’s also worth noting that on average, Americans aren’t working more today than they have been in the recent past. The average number of hours worked in the private sector has hugged tightly to about 34.5 hours a week since 2006, except for a dip during the Great Recession. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com So why is unemployment low? When the BLS determines the unemployment rate, a person is counted as employed as long as they have at least one job. They don’t get counted twice if they have two jobs. So Ocasio-Cortez is wrong in saying multiple job holding and long hours affect the unemployment rate. It’s worth remembering that both of the factors Ocasio-Cortez cited — people working multiple jobs and long hours — are actually good things for the labor market, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "Increases in the number of multiple job holders and longer average work hours almost always accompany a strengthening labor market — that is, a job market in which it is easier to find work, in which spells of unemployment are heading downwards, and in which the ranks of the unemployed are shrinking," Burtless said. Our ruling Ocasio-Cortez said, "Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family." Even taking into account rhetorical excess, her statement is off in multiple ways. Fewer than one in 20 employed Americans holds a second job of any type, and the people who might be working as much as 70 or 80 hours a week represent a tiny fraction of that tiny fraction. The rates for either statistic are not high by historical standards. In any case, the BLS does not use either of those factors in determining the official unemployment rate.

pomt-02342	"Medicare has spent $172 million on penis pumps in the last five years at $360 a pop."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/24/ilyse-hogue/look-medicares-grossly-excessive-spending-penis-pu/	Distinguished legal minds of the U.S. Supreme Court will soon hear oral arguments over whether the federal government can compel businesses to cover contraceptives at no cost to women through the Affordable Care Act. It’s a serious issue. And Comedy Central’s The Daily Show is all over it. Correspondent Samantha Bee took viewers into the debate in a segment host Jon Stewart described as the rare intersection of health care, the economy, aging and penises -- "the issues of greatest consequence to you, the American people." Some conservatives and Catholics argue the contraceptives mandate violates the religious rights of business owners who would have to provide coverage for a medication they do not agree with, and that women who want it should get it on their own. Bee sat down with Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group that supports birth control and the morning-after pill being made available to everyone. Hogue said women use birth control for a number of reasons, including avoiding unintended pregnancies, regulating menstrual cycles and treating endometriosis. The contraception mandate addresses a disparity with the federal government paying for men’s sexual health treatments, she argued. "The existing system is absolutely a double-standard," Hogue said. "Medicare has spent $172 million on penis pumps in the last five years at $360 a pop." Bee considered the information. "Wait, Medicare funds penis pumps?" Truth be told, we were curious too. Can Hogue’s numbers be right, or are they inflated? "Vacuum erection systems" (that’s a more technical term) are one of several ways a man might treat erectile dysfunction, which affects 30 million men, according to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse. We found an inspector general report from the Department of Health and Human Services detailing the issue. (A spokeswoman for NARAL Pro-Choice America later pointed us in the same direction.) The December 2013 report didn’t weigh in on whether it was inappropriate for Medicare to pay for penis pumps. The crux of the review was to find out if Medicare was paying exorbitant rates for them. The devices are among medical supplies eligible for Medicare Part B, which offers supplementary health insurance for medically necessary and preventive services for seniors. The cost of a device like a penis pump is subtracted from a beneficiary’s deductible, and Medicare picks up 80 percent of the cost after that. The auditors’ findings: Medicare payments for vacuum erection systems are more than twice the average payment rate for non-Medicare payers. The difference is "grossly excessive," the report says. From 2006 to 2011, Medicare paid a total of $172.4 million for 473,629 claims for pumps, or about $364 a pump. That’s almost exactly what Hogue said (though spending was measured over a six-year period ending in 2011, not the last five, as she said). Over those six years, annual claims payouts almost doubled, jumping from $20.6 million in 2006 to $38.6 million in 2011, the report says. Medicare would save $18 million a year, and its beneficiaries would pocket $4.5 million, if the program retooled its fee schedule rate to be more in line with other programs and the private market. The report suggests the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services either establish a payment limit or to seek authority from Congress to include the products in its competitive bidding program. Our ruling Hogue said, "Medicare has spent $172 million on penis pumps in the last five years at $360 a pop." We’ll stay out of saying whether it’s legitimate for Medicare to cover vacuum erection systems for older men, and whether it’s unfair that many health plans would have to cover contraception. The Daily Show was trying to make a humorous point about tax money paying for some male sexual health products, which hasn’t been a source of controversy. As for Hogue’s statement, she gets the dollars right but misses on the timeframe. An inspector general’s report measured six years ending in 2011, not the most recent five years. That’s a minor point in judging her overall claim. We rate Hogue’s statement Mostly True.	None	Ilyse Hogue	None	None	None	2014-03-24T14:09:21	2014-03-12	['None']
pomt-14417	Common Core is "education through Washington D.C."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/donald-trump/common-core-education-through-washington-dc-trump-/	Billionaire Donald Trump repeated an often-used conservative attack that Common Core is a federal program, but it looks like he needs a refresher course on the origins of the education standards. The subject came up during a March 10, 2016, primary debate in Miami when CNN moderator Jake Tapper noted Trump had called the standards a disaster. "What are your specific objections to Common Core?" Tapper asked. "Education through Washington, D.C., I don’t want that," Trump replied. "I want local education, I want the parents and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great." When Tapper pointed out to Trump that states developed and adopted the standards willingly, Trump countered that Common Core used to be that way, but has "been taken over by the bureaucrats in Washington." Other candidates have said similar things, pledging to end Common Core when they take office. But Tapper was right, adopting and implementing Common Core is a state choice, not a federal one. Let’s review, shall we? (There won’t be a quiz, we promise.) History lesson The Common Core State Standards are a set of benchmarks for English and math developed after years of discussion between state education departments and private, nonprofit groups. The aim was simple: Prepare pupils for college-level work and careers, and to make sure children in different states across the country were all learning the same things in school. This goes back to 2007, when the state education officials in the Council of Chief State School Officers discussed creating standards everyone could use. The idea was that kids in, say, California schools would have the same academic goals as children in Alabama. Two years later, in 2009, the council and the National Governors Association agreed to create Common Core with input from teachers, parents and education experts. The final guidelines were released in 2010, and states were free to implement them or not. So far, 42 states have agreed to use them, with varying degrees of actual support. Minnesota only chose to use the English standards. South Carolina, Indiana and Oklahoma initially agreed to use Common Core, but have since withdrawn. In the 2016 presidential race, several GOP candidates have vilified the standards as Trump has, accusing the federal government of overreach in trying to unify school boards under the U.S. Education Department. Washington has done a bit to encourage states to adopt the standards. President Barack Obama’s signature education program, Race to the Top, gave states that have adopted a set of standards extra points (40 of a possible 500) when competing for grants. But the federal government didn’t help create the standards, and has no control over how they’re implemented. Even states that have adopted the standards are still free to set their own curricula. In short, it doesn’t matter who the president is, because there’s not much the federal government can do about Common Core. Our ruling Trump said Common Core is "education through Washington D.C." The education standards for English and math were unveiled in 2010 after state school officials, nonprofits, teachers, parents and experts settled on broad education goals. Washington was not a player in that game, although Obama has given states that have education standards a leg up when applying for grant money. We rate Trump’s statement False.

pomt-05731	"When (Marcy) Kaptur fought for the Democrats' prescription drug benefit for seniors, (Dennis) Kucinich voted no."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/05/marcy-kaptur/marcy-kaptur-claims-dennis-kucinich-opposed-senior/	Congressional redistricting in Ohio has turned two veteran incumbents from the same side of the aisle, Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich, into Democratic primary opponents in the new 9th District. Each has a long record to boast, or defend, in what amounts to a fight for survival -- as shown by a 30-second TV ad for Kaptur that Kucinich says misrepresented his voting record on job creation, veterans' care and prescription drug benefits for seniors. PolitiFact Ohio previously looked at two of the claims -- "When Marcy Kaptur brought home $42 million for new manufacturing jobs, Dennis Kucinich voted no" and "When Kaptur helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted no." We rated both Half True. Now we'll look at a third statement: "When Kaptur fought for the Democrats' prescription drug benefit for seniors, Kucinich voted no." The ad cites as its source the role call vote on the Stenholm Amendment to Congressional Resolution 290 of March 23, 2000. Yes, that is 2000. Bill Clinton was in the White House, John McCain had just ceded the race for the Republican presidential nomination to George W. Bush, anxiety over Y2K had passed, unemployment was at 4 percent and the federal budget showed a surplus. Much credit for the latter was claimed by a Republican congressman named John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee. Now Ohio's governor, he was bringing his last budget resolution to the floor -- and, touching on a topic raised frequently in more than 14 hours of debate, promising a prescription drug plan for seniors by the end of the year. According to the Kaptur campaign, Kucinich voted against the prescription drug plan offered by conservative Democrats in their alternative budget proposal, the Stenholm Amendment, at a time "when there was no alternative with a chance." Kucinich voted for another Democratic plan that failed. He would have considered the Stenholm plan a "halfway measure," Kaptur's campaign spokesman said -- "He wanted the perfect, not the good." Kucinich's campaign answered that he voted against the Stenholm Amendment advanced by "Blue Dog" Democrats "because it it also included about $4 billion more in military spending than even the Republicans had proposed. "He supported and voted for the budget plan advanced by the Democratic leadership of the House, which included $40 billion over fiscal years 2001 through 2005 and $155 billion through fiscal year 2010 for a Medicare prescription drug benefit and premium and cost-sharing protections," Kucinich's campaign spokesman added. Kaptur, incidently, also voted for that plan. In fact, the House considered and rejected five budget proposals before passing the resolution offered by Kasich, according to the Congressional Record's account of floor proceedings and the Congressional Research Service: The Owens Amendment, advanced by the Congressional Black Caucus, was defeated by a vote of 70-348. The DeFazio Amendment, offered by the Progressive Caucus, was defeated 61-351. The Sununu Amendment, representing the Republican Conservative Action Team, was defeated 78-339. The Stenholm Amendment, from "Blue Dog" Democrats, "sought to retire the public debt by 2012; provide investments in education, veterans, health care and defense; and establish a $40 billion Medicare reserve fund that can be used for Medicare reform and a prescription drug benefit," according to the CRS summary. It was defeated 171-243. Kaptur voted yes; Kucinich voted no. The Spratt Amendment, advanced by party leadership, "sought to pay down the public debt, provide targeted tax relief to working families, retain 100 percent of the Social Security surplus, and provide funding for a Medicare prescription drug coverage," according to the CRS. It was defeated 184-233. Both Kucinich and Kaptur voted yes. Both voted against the budget resolution advanced by Kasich, which passed 211-207. That brings us back to the claim in the ad: "When Kaptur fought for the Democrats' prescription drug benefit for seniors, Kucinich voted no." We think that claim isn’t accurate on a number of counts. Kucinich did in fact vote no when Kaptur voted yes on one budget proposal. But labeling that proposal as "the Democrats’ prescription drug benefit for seniors" is inaccurate. It was one of four Democratic proposals and not leadership’s plan (which Kucinich and Kaptor both supported. It is misleading to imply that Kucinich’s no vote was a vote against a prescription benefit. His vote came on a resolution encompassing the entire $1.8 trillion federal budget that contained, among many things, the prescription benefit Kaptur’s ad cites.. Ultimately, a dozen years later, the question of whether the plan Kaptur’s ad touts was better is moot. The Spratt Amendment supported by both Kucinich and Kaptur actually won more votes than the Blue Dog proposal that Kaptur backed but Kucinich opposed, but neither was going to win passage from the House's Republican majority.

"Breaking: Breitbart leaks names of four Dems being charged in Mueller’s Russia probe," read the headline on an Oct. 27, 2017, post on FreedomJunkshun.com. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb the spread of fake news. The post came the same day that news broke of a grand jury approving criminal charges in Mueller’s probe. The Special Counsel’s Office did not immediately announce who was being indicted. The FreedomJunkshun.com post said conservative outlet Breitbart broke the news, posting a fake quote that read: "While we won’t go to press ourselves until Monday, we can say with some certainty that Senators Hal Lindsay and Mel Shearer along with Representatives Kurt Mishtain and Bob Newfork will face charges of collusionm with the Russian governement to change the outcome of the 2016 election." (sic) This didn’t happen, of course, and not just because the alleged Breitbart story to which FreedomJunkshun.com linked actually directed readers to a July performance of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at a theater in Berea, Ky. There are no members of Congress in either the House or Senate by those names, either. (The fake Hal Lindsay was previously caught up in a fake news saga involving a drug bust, as chronicled by a site related to FreedomJunkshun.com.) On Oct. 30, the real indictments came down, with President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates pleading not guilty to 12 counts of making false statements, money laundering and more.

pomt-04092	"Gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administration’s projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/17/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-current-fiscal-year-income-tax/	Gov. Chris Christie made some ambitious financial predictions in 2012, generating both praise and controversy. Perhaps the boldest claim? New Jersey’s revenues would rise 8.4 percent for the current fiscal year that began July 1, a forecast criticized by Wall Street analysts and New Jersey Democrats. But Christie has held firm on his forecast and discussed what he said is the state’s improving economic news during his Jan. 8 State of the State address in Trenton. "Gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administration’s projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy," Christie said, citing other accomplishments such as job growth and increases in both consumer spending and industrial production. Looking strictly at numbers, the governor’s claim is accurate. New Jersey operates on a fiscal year that starts July 1 and ends June 30. Since Christie’s comment references the current fiscal year and the months before Hurricane Sandy, which hit the state on Oct. 29, 2012, we’re looking at gross income tax revenue for July through October, and comparing it with the same months in 2011. For the current fiscal year, there was no growth in income tax revenue through August, with receipts falling nearly 1 percent to $780 million from $786 million the year before, according to a monthly report produced by the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services to track growth and decline in state revenue. Things changed in September, when fiscal year-to-date income tax receipts climbed to $1.8 billion from $1.7 billion the year before. "Income tax collections remain strong as the State’s economy continues to grow," state Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said in a September news release about the revenue growth. Fiscal year-to-date revenue through October jumped 9.8 percent to $2.69 billion from $2.45 billion for the same period a year ago, thanks to an extra payday that month and delayed tax payments. Here’s why October’s revenue jump was so high. Employers in New Jersey pay withholding taxes to the state every Wednesday, generating between $100 million to $150 million, said David Rosen, chief budget officer for the OLS. October happened to have five Wednesdays, meaning an extra $100 million or so in revenue for the state. Another accounting shift resulted in a $60 million increase because of Tropical Storm Irene. When Irene hit in late August 2011, taxpayers were given until Oct. 30 to make their quarterly tax payment normally due in September. That payment was to generate $60 million for the state. As a result of the deadline extension, the money didn’t show up in the state accounting system until November. So, the October ledger was minus $60 million. The October 2012 ledger, however, shows $60 million because the usual Sept. 15 tax payment deadline applied this year and the money ended up in state coffers on time. "Combined, these two effects artificially boost the current cash flow by about $160 million compared to last year’s baseline," the October 2012 OLS revenue report states. So technically, there was growth in income tax receipts -- with some help from bookkeeping measures. "The statement is literally true," Rosen said of Christie’s claim. Treasury data showed similar growth in gross income tax receipts, but other revenue accounts aren’t doing as well, according to numbers from both the Treasury and OLS. Overall, New Jersey faces a shortfall of $425.9 million for the first six months of the fiscal year. Adding in money left over from last year, the total shortall is $549 million. Christie spokesmen Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling During his State of the State address last week, Christie said, "Gross income tax receipts are exceeding the Administration’s projections for this fiscal year prior to Sandy." Looking at the current fiscal year, year-to-date gross income tax revenue increased year-over-year in September and October -- even though October’s significant growth resulted primarily because of an extra payday that month and an accounting measure. We rate his statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1b929584-ab6d-4ac6-8053-5a4b979762eb To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-15103	"Jeb's policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/sep/15/donald-trump/trump-blames-bush-recession-florida/	Billionaire businessman Donald Trump blamed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for the Sunshine State’s recession woes, saying Bush’s policies were the catalyst for financial disaster. "Jeb’s policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse," Trump tweeted on Sept. 8, 2015. "Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers — wow!" For this fact-check, we wanted to look at Trump’s claim that Bush’s policies as governor led to financial ruin in the Sunshine State. (For more on Bush's work after he left office, read this Tampa Bay Times story.) Let’s see if Trump truly can blame Florida’s experience of the Great Recession on his GOP rival. Boom and bust There’s no question that Bush oversaw a booming economic climate in Florida while he was governor. Between January 1999 and January 2007, the state’s population grew by 3.5 million people, a legacy that is now a cornerstone of Bush’s presidential campaign. He has made repeated boasts about spikes in job growth and cuts in taxation and spending. But he also was fortunate to leave office just as the economy was starting to falter. The state’s housing market, which had skyrocketed even more than the rest of the nation, cratered in the aftermath. Florida eventually lost 1 million of the 1.33 million new jobs that were created during Bush’s tenure. Many critics, like Trump, have said Bush can’t take credit for the party without accepting the blame for the hangover. So what caused the financial crisis? It was a mix of factors, leading to a perfect storm as home sales peaked in 2005 and 2006. The combination included untested financial regulations, lax lending, overzealous bankers and traders, poor risk assessment, greedy investors, compliant governments on all levels and a global economy looking for easy money. When the bubble burst, Florida was among the hardest-hit because it had gained so much during the boom. But observers told us that it is foolhardy to pin the meltdown on any single state official, let alone Bush. The downturn was a nationwide phenomenon, not just a problem in Florida. "During a time when the global financial system was pumping cheap money into housing, mortgage credit rationally flowed to the fastest growing states," said Kwame Donaldson, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. "This system inflated prices in these states to unsustainable levels, and created the boom-and-bust cycle that seems so obvious in retrospect. None of this is Jeb Bush’s fault." That’s not to say Bush escapes all culpability. Some economists and experts told us that Bush’s actions surely encouraged overbuilding during the boom, and state officials became addicted to the increase in tax revenue it brought, especially for schools. Many of those results were based on Florida’s growth management policies, however, which had been in place long before Bush took office. Under Bush, the state did loosen construction regulations by weakening the Department of Community Affairs, said University of Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research economist David Denslow, but easing rules on building happened at all levels of government. It also was a combination of what Bush didn’t do that helped fuel the bubble. "With hindsight, Bush could have discouraged excessive development through more regulation of the mortgage industry, … with speeches saying house prices were too high, and by strongly fighting for higher impact fees," Denslow wrote in an email. "That said, there were similar housing booms in other places that had pretty much avoided them since the early 1970s." Some states managed to avoid the worst of the recession with policies that controlled growth and borrowing. Texas, for example, did not suffer as badly because the state restricted how much equity homeowners could pull out of their homes. But other states like Arizona and Nevada joined Florida in disproportionately enjoying the boom and suffering more during the bust. Florida State University economics professor Randall Holcombe added that Florida had the double whammy of losing tourists during the recession, weakening another cornerstone of the state economy. But none of this nuance is apparent in Trump’s accusation, Holcombe said, because the billionaire doesn’t give any specifics. (We asked Trump's campaign for evidence but didn't hear back.) "Only somebody who is very uninformed would blame that downturn on Jeb, or on economic policy at the state level in Florida," Holcombe said. Our ruling Trump said, "Jeb's policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse." Economists told us the Great Recession was precipitated by a housing bubble that grew out of multiple factors, including policies on all levels of government. While Bush’s actions as governor may not have done anything to prevent the financial crisis — some experts said he could have worked to throttle down the overbuilding — all agreed he did not cause the recession.

pomt-06700	"Mayor Fung wants to punish our children's education by removing 12 million dollars from current funding to pay for his private charter school. Your taxes would increase by between 6 and 8 percent per year."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/sep/04/richard-tomlins/robocall-says-cranston-mayoral-academy-would-incre/	Last month, many residents of Cranston received an anonymous recorded call with a message delivered by an authoritative-sounding male voice warning: "Parents, teachers, students and taxpayers. On Wednesday, Aug. 24, at 5 p.m. in front of the Cranston City Hall there will be a rally to save Cranston's award-winning school district. Mayor Fung wants to punish our children's education by removing $12 million from current funding to pay for his private charter school. Your taxes would increase by between 6 and 8 percent per year. This will be your last chance to deny the mayor from making our district second class. Be there." Pulling $12 million out the Cranston school system sounded bad enough, but the prospect of a tax increase of 6 percent to 8 percent was even more frightening. But we were skeptical because, in the first place, state law limits property tax increases (the limit is currently 4.25 percent) unless a city or town gets a special exception from the General Assembly. So we decided to investigate. THE BACKGROUND Charter schools are financed by local tax dollars but are free from many of the requirements that apply to traditional public schools. Supporters say such flexibility allows charters to have longer days and longer school years, and to experiment with alternative teaching methods. The students are usually chosen by lotteries and most schools are not unionized. Cranston Mayor Allan Fung had proposed a public charter school, known as a mayoral academy, for Cranston and Providence. A similar school is operating for residents of Cumberland, Lincoln, Central Falls and Pawtucket. Under Fung’s proposal, the school would have been run by Achievement First, a nonprofit group that operates 19 similar charter schools in Connecticut and New York City. A board of directors headed by the mayor would have overseen the school. The proposal was rejected by the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education on Sept. 1, 2011, after intervention by Gov. Lincoln Chafee, who recommended an alternative: studying the possibility of creating an Achievement First mayoral academy in Providence, drawing students from that city, Cranston, and other communities. In his letter, Chafee urged the regents to take the opposition in Cranston -- and there was a lot of it -- seriously. Opponents say such schools are a threat to traditional public schools because they siphon away the most-promising students (those whose parents are involved enough to apply for the lottery) and drain the resources needed to make public schools better. The robocall was reflecting that concern. The calls were financed by Richard Tomlins, a Democrat who ran against Fung for mayor in 2010. He wrote the script for the calls. We asked Tomlins why he referred to the academy as a "private" school when accountability would lie with the mayor, any Cranston child could apply for the lottery and parents wouldn't have to pay tuition. Tomlins said it was because the nonprofit company that runs it, Achievement First, accepts corporate donations. He said the $12-million figure came from multiplying the amount spent on teaching a child in Cranston (about $13,000 per pupil) by the number of pupils who would be leaving the system (950). He said the robocall predicted an annual 6 percent to 8 percent tax increase because that's what it would take to raise the $12 million from property taxes. THE ACTUAL NUMBERS To check, we turned to an analysis by the Rhode Island Department of Education, which developed a list of the costs to Cranston of the proposed charter school. First we looked whether the mayoral academy, if approved, would draw $12 million from "current funding." The fact is, the project would not have removed a dime from the budget for the current fiscal year because the school would not have begun operations until a year from now. So right off the bat, we were smelling lighter fluid. Then, we examined whether the $12 million would be true for subsequent years. According to the Rhode Island Department of Education, in the first year of operation, the school would have had 88 Cranston kindergartners, not 950 students as Tomlins had said. The state said the cost to the city that first year would have been $664,670, a price tag that would continue to grow as the school added more grades. By the time those kindergartners had become fifth graders and the academy had evolved into a full-fledged elementary school in the fall of 2017, the annual loss to Cranston's school department was projected to be $6.2 million. At that point, it would have had 460 students, nearly half of what Tomlins said. Thus, the amount of "current funding" being diverted to the academy this year, or six years from now, would not have come close to the $12 million mentioned in the robocall. THE TAX QUESTION How much would taxes go up if there had been a mayoral academy in Cranston? For most PolitiFact items, we don't look at predictions. After all, things can change and predictions can only be fact-checked in retrospect. But the debate over taxes offers some insight into one reason the academy was so controversial. Fung’s proposal came at a time when Cranston is getting a big infusion of state education money -- the amount goes up by an extra $2.3 million per year every year through 2018 -- thanks to the state's new financing formula that benefits some communities over others. The bad news for the School Department: It doesn't necessarily get to keep that money; it follows the student wherever that student goes. Thus, if pupils get diverted to a mayoral academy that the School Department doesn't control, the department loses revenue. Fung said that should not have mattered. The School Department may lose some financing, but it would also be losing students and the costs associated with teaching them. The cumulative projected cost of Cranston's share of the academy over six years was $20.3 million. Extra aid from the state financing formula over the same period will be $63.4 million. "The funding formula is a per-pupil allocation and schools have to live within that," said Fung, whose Aug. 9 financial analysis of the proposal asserted that any fears that the mayoral academy "would necessitate new tax dollars, or may add an additional tax burden on Cranston residents are unfounded." But opponents of the academy said it's not so simple. Losing 4 percent of your students may immediately take away 4 percent of your revenue, but it doesn't automatically cut 4 percent of your costs. Steven Bloom, the unofficial budget expert on the School Committee and the man Tomlins himself suggested we consult, said that if the academy had been approved, it would have plunged the School Department's budget into the red by $20 million after five years and necessitated an annual tax increase of 2 percent to 3 percent per year. (One reason: The department is trying to pay the city back for the $6 million it overspent in the previous years. Bloom said that without the academy, the department should be in the black by the 2016-17 fiscal year, thanks in part to the extra state money.) ROBOCALL DOES NOT COMPUTE But we're checking the facts behind Tomlins' robocall, a call that may have galvanized some of the local opposition Chafee was talking about. It is also a call that Bloom, an opponent of the mayoral academy, characterized as "infuriating" and misinformed. So let's summarize. Tomlins characterized the mayoral academy as Fung's "private charter school," said it would have removed "$12 million from current funding," and would have increased taxes "between 6 and 8 percent per year." It would not have been Fung's private school -- he would not have been able to take it with him when he left office. It would not have been a private school at all. It would not have drained any money from the current school budget. It would not have drained $12 million from the city in any annual budget projected through 2018. The projected cumulative cost over six years would have been $20.3 million at a time when the city would be getting a $63.4 million infusion in additional state aid. Even if you bought Bloom's argument that the academy would ultimately have sent the School Department $20 million into the red, that still would have left Cranston with $23.1 million more in its coffers to help improve the city's public schools. And to threaten that the mayoral academy would have increased taxes by 6 percent to 8 percent each year when state law makes it difficult to impose such big tax hikes is ridiculous. There were legitimate reasons to support or oppose Cranston's mayoral academy, but this robocall didn't correctly cite any of them. And because the false, inflammatory statements were made anonymously, we're going to do a little inflaming of our own. We rate Tomlin's ridiculous robocall Pants On Fire!

pomt-09723	A "fairly limited number of people, 25 million to 30 million," will be allowed to access a national health insurance exchange.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/26/claire-mccaskill/who-is-allowed-health-insurance-exchange/	Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., appeared on This Week with George Stephanopoulos to discuss health care reform and the concerns of moderate Democrats that it not add to the deficit. McCaskill said she supported a public option for health insurance and believed that it would end up as part of the final plan. The public option would be one plan among many private plans available on a health insurance exchange, she said. "Keep in mind, not everybody can even go to this exchange and buy insurance with any kind of subsidy. This is going to be a fairly limited number of people — 25 million to 30 million are the estimates — that would even be on this insurance exchange. By and large, most of this country is going to continue to get their health insurance through their employer." We were interested in McCaskill's statement because we've been following the legislation to see who would be allowed onto the exchange. To go over a few health care reform basics: The Democratic plans would leave in place the current system of private insurance, which covers a majority of Americans. The plans would also increase regulation for insurance companies, require everyone to buy health insurance and provide more subsidies for low-income people. People who are uninsured or work for a small business would be able to buy coverage on the exchange, which would offer a variety of plans. One aspect still up in the air is the public option, a plan on the exchange that would be run by the government. People could choose whether to enroll in the public option. McCaskill said that only a limited number of people would be eligible to shop on the exchange, and that is the case with the proposal approved by the Senate Finance Committee. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed the committee bill and found that between 23 million and 27 million would buy insurance from the exchange by 2019. The CBO said that most of the people using the exchange would be people who buy insurance on their own in the individual market, and employees who work for small businesses. The CBO also looked at the House bill, a slightly different plan, and found that 30 million would use the exchange in 2019. (We should note that the Senate Finance Committee proposal did not include a public option, but it's expected that the full Senate will consider a public option of some type.) Not everybody likes the limitation on who can shop on the exchange. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., for example, has been promoting an amendment that would open the exchange to people who get insurance from a large employer. "Under the nation's current employer-based system, most people have little if any choice about where they get their insurance," Wyden wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times. "They just have to accept the plan that comes with their job. That insurance company, in turn, is provided a captive group of customers, so it has no incentive to earn their loyalty." We should also note that President Barack Obama was fond of saying on the campaign trail that people could buy insurance on a new exchange "if you don't have insurance, or don't like your insurance." He mentioned it as recently as June in remarks to the American Medical Association: "Now, if you don't like your health coverage or you don't have any insurance at all, you'll have a chance under what we've proposed to take part in what we're calling a health insurance exchange," Obama said to the AMA on June 15, 2009. But that wouldn't be the case under the terms of the Senate Finance proposal, which was unveiled in September. Keep in mind that health care legislation has yet to be finalized, so we'll be keeping an eye on this provision. Getting back to McCaskill's remark, she said that it would be "a fairly limited number of people — 25 million to 30 million are the estimates — that would even be on this insurance exchange. By and large, most of this country is going to continue to get their health insurance through their employer." The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the Senate bill and pegged it at 23 million to 27 million by 2019, slightly less than the 30 million the CBO estimated under the House bill. Roughly speaking, that's less than 10 percent of the U.S. population. McCaskill is off by just a little bit on the Senate version and on the money for the House bill. So we rate her statement True.

pomt-09563	"I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jan/29/charlie-crist/florida-gov-crist-says-he-has-suspended-37-public-/	Some of Florida's public officials have been bad boys and girls, Gov. Charlie Crist says. "You know, I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months," Crist told reporters gathered in Tallahassee on Jan. 27, 2010. "It's pretty stunning, and it's pretty disappointing." The Florida Constitution enables Crist, as governor, to suspend any elected public official indicted for a crime and remove public officials from office who are convicted. The governor also can suspend state or county officials -- anyone from people appointed to state or local boards or even public notaries -- for misconduct. Is Crist really on a suspension-a-month pace? We asked the governor's office for a list of people suspended by the governor since he took office in January 2007. Officials provided a seven-page document listing 38 names and titles of people they say the governor has suspended or removed from public office. Each entry includes a corresponding charge and points to an executive order codifying the action. (You can read the governor's document for yourself.) The list includes some familiar names: *No. 28 -- James "Bob" Richburg, the former Northwest Florida State College president. Richburg was suspended from the board of directors of Workforce Florida in April 2009 after being indicted in the case involving former House Speaker Ray Sansom. Sansom has been accused of falsely securing $6 million in taxpayer money to construct a college building that would double as an aircraft hangar for a friend and major Republican donor. * No. 35 -- Scott Rothstein. Rothstein was suspended from a judicial nominating committee after agreeing to be permanently disbarred. A major political fundraiser, Rothstein pleaded guilty on Jan. 27, 2010, to five counts of racketeering, fraud and money laundering as part of a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme. * No. 34 and No. 38 -- Miami City Commissioner Michelle Spence-Jones. Spence-Jones was suspended by Crist in November 2009 after being arrested on charges that she redirected $50,000 in county funds to a now-defunct family business. She won her seat back in a special election in January 2010. She was immediately suspended again. The list also includes people probably unfamiliar to most, including eight notary publics. The notary publics, who are considered state officers under Florida law, were suspended in most cases for notarizing signatures and documents improperly. Examining the full list, we found some problems: * Beverly Gallagher, a member of the Broward County School Board, is listed wrongly both as No. 30 and 32. Her entries point to two different executive orders -- one that removes her from office, and one that removes someone else. Gallagher and Broward County Commissioner Josephus Eggelletion (No. 31 on the governor's list) were arrested in September on federal corruption charges, accused of taking bribes. * Gregory Burke is both No. 7 and No. 25. Burke, a commissioner of the South Walton County Mosquito Control District, was first suspended from office Dec. 13, 2007, then removed by Crist on Dec. 24, 2008 -- hence the two separate entries. * Two officials -- Miami City Commissioner Johnny Lee Winton and Hollywood City Commissioner Kenneth Wasserstrom -- were removed from office by Crist but actually suspended by Gov. Jeb Bush. * Another official, Miramar City Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman, appears on the list twice. The first entry was from March 2007, when he was reinstated into office by Crist (he had been suspended by Bush). Salesman was then suspended by Crist in December 2007 after being arrested. * No. 20, Johnny Green, was suspended from the Cross City water board after being charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, according to the governor's office. Green's entry appears to note that the suspension was dissolved by Executive Order 08-235, but that order actually acknowledges a judicial vacancy in the 17th Judicial Circuit. The governor's list also includes one person who has returned to office and appears to overlook another person the governor suspended in 2008. John Scanlon, a commissioner with the Fort Myers Beach Fire Control District, was suspended after drug charges, but reinstated after completion of a pretrial diversion program. And James Roy Paul, superintendent of the Escambia County School District, was suspended from office by the governor in June 2008 after being charged with driving under the influence. But he was not on the governor's list. Where does all of that bring us in the accounting? First, we excluded the double reference to Gallagher and the entry reinstating Salesman. That drops us to 36. We then added Paul, who was not on the governor's list. Back to 37. We then double-checked that everyone on that list had been in fact suspended. We relied on the governor's online repository of executive orders, and when that didn't help, news accounts. When both options failed, as it did in one case, we asked the governor's office for the executive order directly. Then there was the case of three officials (Winton, Wasserstrom, Burke) whom Crist removed from office. You can make an argument that reduces the number of suspensions to 34. Crist told reporters he has had to "suspend no less than 37 public officials" since taking office in 2007. He's just about right on. The number actually includes people Crist removed from office, a more severe punishment than suspension. And the final number includes the suspensions of eight public notaries -- not what most people think of when they hear "public official." Crist gets points off for both, and from PolitiFact, a rating of Mostly True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-01-29T18:21:11	2010-01-27	['None']
pomt-07472	Says Gov. Rick Scott's approval ratings are up.	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/15/brian-kilmeade/fox-and-friends-host-says-gov-rick-scotts-approval/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott appeared on Fox News Channel's popular Fox and Friends morning show on April 15, 2011, to make the case that it's possible for Washington to solve its debt crisis without raising taxes. Look at Florida, he said. Speaking via satellite, Scott noted that he has proposed a balanced budget for Florida (as he's obligated to do by the state Constitution) that cuts spending and reduces taxes. He left out, we should note, that the key parts of his budget proposal -- a cut to the corporate tax rate and cuts to school property taxes -- are currently not part of the plans being considered by either the House or Senate. Regardless, Scott told Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade that President Barack Obama needs to extend the Bush-era tax cuts. If the tax cuts expire, businesses will move elsewhere, where the tax climate is more friendly, Scott said. The message worked on Kilmeade -- who at the end of a four-minute interview said Scott's message and proposals are resonating with Florida voters. His proof? Scott's approval ratings. "The states that have to balance the budget are making the tough decisions, and getting appreciation for it. Your approval ratings are up," said Kilmeade, who went on to say that approval numbers are also up for governors in similar positions -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat from New York, and Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican from New Jersey. We don't know much about Cuomo or Christie, but we know Scott's positions have been pretty polarizing on some issues. So we were curious if Kilmeade had it right. We found two different polls that have tracked Scott's approval rating since taken office -- Public Policy Polling, a firm associated with Democratic candidates, and polling from Quinnipiac University, a group generally considered independent. We found an isolated third poll from Viewpoint Florida, a polling firm run by longtime consultants with ties to Florida Republicans. We'll start with Public Policy Polling. A PPP poll from December, before Scott took office, found that 33 percent of Florida voters liked Scott compared with 43 percent who disliked him. A follow-up poll released March 29, 2011, revealed that Scott's negative numbers had gotten worse -- not better -- since taking office. In the March poll, 32 percent of voters approved of Scott's job performance, while 55 percent disapproved. "You could say Rick Scott's honeymoon is over ... but that would suggest he had one in the first place," Tom Jensen, a Public Policy Polling analyst wrote last week. The Quinnipiac polls also show Scott's negatives climbing, not falling. The number of Florida voters who disapprove of Scott has more than doubled since February, the polling group found. Scott had a positive 35-22 percent job approval in a poll released Feb. 2. In a follow-up poll April 6, 35 percent approved of Scott's performance, but 48 disapproved. "Today, Scott is a four-letter word to many Florida voters, but political popularity can change with time," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "The experience of Scott's predecessor, Charlie Crist, who had 70 percent approval ratings at this point in his tenure, shows how fickle public opinion can be." The third poll, from Viewpoint Florida, paints a slightly better picture for Scott. Forty-seven respondents surveyed March 29-30 approved of Scott's performance, while 48 percent disapproved. Pollster Randy Nielsen said the polling group didn't have previous approval numbers to compare it to. Scott acknowledged his poor poll numbers in an Associated Press article on April 6. "I didn't run to be the most popular governor. I ran to make sure this state is most likely to succeed," he said. Kilmeade, on Fox and Friends, said Scott's approval numbers are going up.

pomt-03310	President Barack Obama has "announced that he would not sign ANY spending bills this year unless sequestration spending cuts are eliminated."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/29/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-barack-obama-has-promised-veto-u/	As the nation hurtles toward another possible fiscal showdown, both President Barack Obama and House Republicans are engaging in a pre-emptive blame game. "Last month, through a series of Statements of Administration Policy, the president announced that he would not sign ANY spending bills this year unless sequestration spending cuts are eliminated – and replaced with his plan for higher, job-destroying taxes," wrote House Speaker John Boehner in a statement on his website on July 22, 2013. (Sequestration refers to the mandatory, across-the-board cuts in every federal agency that took effect earlier this year.) The Ohio Republican was citing a pair of messages Obama released in June called Statements of Administration Policy. SAPs, as they are known, are used to officially convey whether an administration will support or oppose a particular bill pending in Congress. We located the two statements in question, both of which addressed annual bills to fund parts of the federal government: H.R. 2216 (the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2014) and H.R. 2217 (the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2014). Both SAPs were released on June 3, and they had nearly identical language in an underlined section, the usual signal of the document’s main point. "Unless this bill passes the Congress in the context of an overall budget framework that supports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national security for our economy to compete in the future, the President’s senior advisors would recommend that he veto (the bill) and any other legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework." We decided to check two elements of Boehner’s claim. Did Obama really say he "would not sign" the bills? And did Obama’s potential veto hinge on "sequestration spending cuts (being) eliminated"? Veto threat kabuki An almost Talmudic hierarchy of veto-threat language has developed over the years, remaining much the same regardless of who is in the White House. Keith Hennessey, who spent several years as a senior aide to President George W. Bush and is now a lecturer at Stanford University, has developed a handy primer for the linguistic nuances of SAPs. The first three of his examples involve gradations of approval for pending bills. From there, the language proceeds, with increasing degrees of opposition, to: • The administration opposes the bill. • The administration strongly opposes the bill. • If the president were presented this bill for signature, a particular administration official would recommend that he veto it. • If the president were presented this bill for signature, the president’s senior advisers would recommend he veto it. • If the president were presented this bill for signature, he would veto it. • If the president is presented this bill for signature, he will veto it. • If this bill makes it to my desk, I will veto it. (This one is more commonly used in a public appearance than in a Statement of Administration Policy.) So the statements that Boehner referred to used language that was about half-way up the hierarchy of presidential opposition. We asked several experts in the back-and-forth between the White House and Congress whether they thought it was reasonable for Boehner to call Obama’s language a sign that he "would not sign" the bills in question. Most took a middle ground, saying Boehner was right to suggest strong opposition by Obama but wrong to imply that Obama had closed the door to negotiation. Obama’s wording "is customary for a veto threat communicated through OMB -- they always leave enough wiggle room for compromise," said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist and budget expert at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, agreed, saying that Obama’s wording is usually "meant as a strong ‘no’ … but a ‘no’ that is meant to say he is firm in his position and that it's time to negotiate." Does Obama’s threat hinge on sequestration? Obama’s SAPs don’t explicitly say the restoration of sequestration cuts would trigger a veto, mentioning instead "legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework." In his statement, then, Boehner makes a reasonable point: Obama opposes the House Republican budget framework, which doesn’t envision restoration of past sequestration cuts. In fact, it would make even deeper cuts. The White House has "made very clear that their idea of a budget framework does away with sequestration," said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner. "So he’s saying he won’t sign these bills absent a plan to do away with sequestration." However, budget experts say Boehner went too far by suggesting that sequestration is Obama’s specific line in the sand. The experts say that while Obama strongly opposes the current design of the House Republicans’ budget, he left vague exactly what provisions he would agree to. Obama didn’t say that restoration of sequestration cuts was non-negotiable. "The president said only that he would veto bills unless it was part of a budget agreement, but he absolutely did not say what that agreement should be," said Stan Collender, a former Democratic staff member of the House and Senate Budget Committees who is now a partner at the lobbying and consulting firm Qorvis. "He did not insist that sequestration not happen or that taxes be raised." Our ruling Boehner said that Obama has "announced that he would not sign ANY spending bills this year unless sequestration spending cuts are eliminated." Obama did issue a strongly worded statement opposing two spending bills backed by House Republicans, but Boehner exaggerated how firm a veto threat it was and underplayed the president’s openness to negotiation. Meanwhile, Obama did say he opposed bills enacting the House Republican budget, but he didn’t make restoration of sequestration cuts a non-negotiable demand in any negotiated deal. On balance, we rate Boehner’s claim Half True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2013-07-29T11:15:22	2013-07-22	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-11429	"A quarter of our guns are sold outside of the background checks."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/16/steve-bullock/what-percentage-gun-sales-are-done-without-backgro/	Reacting to the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. that killed 17 people, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin spoke out for universal background checks -- that is, requiring them for every gun sale. The Wisconsin Democrat said universal checks are supported by 97 percent of gun owners, a claim we rated Mostly True, based on the latest national polling of households that have guns. Clearly, the checks -- the potential buyer shows identification, completes a federal form and goes through an instant criminal background check -- are not required for all gun sales. Indeed, under federal law, only federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run the checks. So, what percentage of guns are sold without a background check? Possible White House hopeful’s claim On March 7, 2018, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock -- a possible Democratic contender for president in 2020 -- visited Milwaukee to raise money for Wisconsin Democrats. Interviewed by WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee, he touched briefly on guns, voicing support for universal background checks and saying: "It makes no sense that a quarter of our guns are sold outside of the background checks." So, Bullock’s claim is 25 percent. ‘Zombie’ claim After the Florida school shooting, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on NBC’s "Meet the Press" that "40 percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks." But that was wrong. PolitiFact Florida rated his statement False. So did the Washington Post Fact Checker and FactCheck.org. All three agreed, and Sanders’ staff essentially acknowledged, he was using an outdated statistic from a 1994 study. Recent study The fact checks, and experts we contacted, instead cited a study authored by researchers from Northeastern and Harvard universities that was published in January 2017. They did an online survey, in 2015, of 1,613 adult gun owners. Among gun owners who said they obtained their most recent gun within the two previous years: 22 percent overall said they obtained the guns without a background check. But that includes guns that were purchased or received in another way, such as through a gift or an inheritance. 13 percent who purchased firearms -- for example, from a friend or online -- said they had done so without a background check. The lower figure applies here, given that Bullock’s claim is about gun sales. Our rating Bullock says: "A quarter of our guns are sold outside of the background checks." The latest study that surveyed gun owners on the topic found that, among gun owners who had acquired a gun in some way within the previous two years, 22 percent had done so without a background check. That’s close to Bullock’s figure. But it takes into account people who acquired guns either by purchasing them, or by simply receiving them, for example as a gift. Among those surveyed who had purchased a gun within the previous two years, only 13 percent said they had done so without a background check. We rate Bullock’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-04715	Says opponents of the health care law "prevailed on our two main arguments" to the U.S. Supreme Court.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/01/sam-olens/olens-says-states-prevailed-obamacare-arguments/	Most Republicans were fuming after the U.S. Supreme Court announced its highly anticipated ruling on the federal government’s controversial health care law in June, which was widely seen as a win for President Barack Obama, who pushed it through Congress. And so we found it surprising when Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens declared a victory of sorts in the case during his remarks at the Republican National Convention. "We prevailed on our two main arguments," Olens said. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was alongside Olens, explained. "The court agreed that the commerce clause of the Constitution does not allow the federal government to force you to purchase a product you don’t want," she said. "The court agreed that the Constitution does not allow the federal government to force states to adopt a budget-busting expansion of Medicaid." The two attorney generals then led the convention hall in a call-and-response that voiced their displeasure with the law they derisively call "Obamacare." We decided to weigh the evidence of this claim about victory on the two main arguments and put its accuracy on trial in our PolitiFact courtroom. Did Olens and Co. win on the commerce clause argument and their point about Medicaid? The health care bill was signed into law by Obama in March 2010. The National Federation of Independent Business, 26 states, including Florida and Georgia, and some individuals joined forces to file a lawsuit to have the new law overturned. They argued it violated the U.S. Constitution on several fronts. The original complaint was filed in a federal court in Florida, led by Bill McCollum, who was then the state’s attorney general; Bondi was his successor. Olens was elected as Georgia’s attorney general in November 2010 and took office the following January. Let’s first deal with the Medicaid claim. The law expands the number of people eligible for insurance. The law provides that the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these individuals through 2016. In the following years, the federal payment level gradually decreases, to a minimum of 90 percent. The states that sued said the eligibility expansion would be a burdensome cost. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. "As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening existing Medicaid funding," Chief Justice John G. Roberts wrote. "Congress has no authority to order the States to regulate according to its instructions. Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer." Now, about the other part of Olens’ claim. Nels Peterson, Georgia’s solicitor general, said Olens was correct because the court agreed with the states’ argument that the individual mandate is not a valid exercise of Congress’ power under the commerce clause in the U.S. Constitution. "Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not do," Roberts wrote. "The Framers knew the difference between doing something and doing nothing. They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it. Ignoring that distinction would undermine the principle that the Federal Government is a government of limited and enumerated powers. The individual mandate thus cannot be sustained under Congress’s power to ‘regulate Commerce.‘ " Peterson said the court found another rationale to rule in favor of the individual mandate. Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that the individual mandate could stand, instead, because it may "reasonably" be characterized as a tax. "Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness," Roberts wrote. Peterson described Olens’ argument about the legal arguments a "sophisticated, subtle point." "We won on our two main arguments," Peterson said, "but lost anyway." Kathleen Burch, who teaches constitutional law at Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School, said the argument made at the convention was somewhat misleading because the federal government had argued in the lower courts that it had the power to apply an individual mandate under the Constitution’s taxing and spending clause. "It is true that the primary, meaning leading argument, made by the states was that the individual mandate violates the commerce clause, but the federal government came back and said that it had the power under the taxing and spending clause," Burch said. The plaintiff’s original complaint in Florida argued that the federal government could not impose an individual mandate "under Article I of the Constitution of the United States, and cannot be upheld under the Commerce Clause … the Taxing and Spending Clause, id.; or any other provision of the Constitution." "In some ways [Olens’] argument was a little disingenuous because of its omissions," Burch said. Again, Olens said the states prevailed on their two main arguments. The attorney general was correct that they won their arguments on the commerce clause and about Medicaid. But a part of the states’ original argument was also that the government couldn’t use the taxing and spending clause to make individuals buy health insurance. We believe that additional information is necessary to examine this claim. Our verdict: Mostly True.	None	Sam Olens	None	None	None	2012-09-01T06:00:00	2012-08-29	['None']
pomt-13850	"We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jul/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-set-record-most-gop-primary-votes-eve/	They say the third time’s the charm. For Donald Trump, his third claim about a historic showing in the GOP primary finally hit the mark. First, he jumped the gun. Next, he exaggerated his margin of victory. But in a speech in Raleigh on July 5, Trump accurately described his historic accomplishment. "We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party," he said, speaking just of the primary elections – since, of course, the general election hasn’t happened yet. How did Trump avoid some of the pitfalls he has made in the past with this unexpectedly tricky claim? In April, he claimed he had received the most votes of any Republican nominee ever. PolitiFact rated that False, because he had not received the most votes ever. However, as the article noted, Trump did have the chance to reach that milestone with strong showings in some upcoming primaries. Then on June 1, Trump said he had broken the record by millions of votes. PolitiFact rated that statement False as well. Trump had finally broken the record, but only by a small amount. "Had Trump made a correct claim in one breath only to mangle the truth in the next?" we asked. Yes, he had. But he finally got it right by avoiding any embellishment, and just sticking to the claim of a record-breaking victory. According to Real Clear Politics, Trump received about 13.3 million votes during the primary. That’s about 1.8 million votes more than the previous record, held by George W. Bush. Basking in the record On Tuesday, Trump spoke about winning in face of a crowded primary field and a "rigged system," then name-dropped some GOP elders whose vote totals he eclipsed. "Not only did the Republican party go way up from what it was four years ago – way, way up – but Donald Trump, in the history of the primary system, Republican Party, with 17 people running – a lot of people don’t understand, when you say 17 people – I got almost 14 million votes," Trump said. "More than anybody in the history of the Republican Party. More than Ronald Reagan. More than the Bushes. More than Richard Nixon. More than Dwight D. Eisenhower, who did win the second World War; it certainly helped a heck of a lot." "We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party," he continued. "It was such a big thing for me. We won 37 states. We got stronger and stronger and stronger." A less dubious record But does his record mean that Trump is the most popular Republican candidate ever? No. What Trump didn’t mention was that during this primary, most Republican voters cast a ballot for someone other than him. More than 16 million people cast votes for another candidate, according to a Washington Post analysis. To be fair, Trump was facing a crowded primary field, which he mentioned in his speech. But 13 of his 16 challengers didn’t make much of a splash. The top three challengers, however – Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio, in that order – combined to receive more than 15 million votes. So Trump now holds two GOP primary records: most votes for, and most votes against. Previously, John McCain was the holder of the most-votes-against record. As the national convention approaches, it’s also worth noting that Trump isn’t the only GOP frontrunner to have received less than half of his party’s votes in the primary, but he is one of just a few. The nomination results in past cases have been a mixed bag. McCain won the nomination in 2008 despite receiving less than half the votes, as did Barry Goldwater in 1964. But the frontrunners in 1968 (Ronald Reagan) and 1952 (Robert Taft) went into the convention with less than 50 percent of the primary votes and ended up losing the nomination. Finally, it’s worth noting that some historical comparisons of vote totals and percentages are hardly apples-to-apples. The current primary system is a relatively new process. As one political scientist previously told PolitiFact, "Before the 1970s, candidates often did not run in many primaries and caucuses to win delegates" because party leaders had more influence than they do now, and national conventions were typically contested no matter what. Our ruling Trump said he got the most votes in the history of the Republican Party primary system. That’s accurate. He received 13.3 million votes, beating George W. Bush’s record of 11.5 million votes. Yet what Trump failed to mention is that he also holds the record for the most votes cast against a primary candidate, and that he’s one of only a few Republican frontrunners in modern history to have been supported by less than half of the party’s primary voters. Because Trump’s claim was accurate but missing that context, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/be10f613-3754-43fd-9d02-e89f00619253	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-08T19:18:23	2016-07-05	['None']
pomt-10669	When Obama was sworn into office, "he DID NOT use the Holy Bible, but instead the Kuran (Their equivalency to our Bible, but very different beliefs)."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/20/chain-email/obama-sworn-in-on-his-bible/	An anonymous e-mail says Barack Obama took the oath of office for the U.S. Senate on a Koran, the holy book of Islam. We thought it would be odd if that were true, since Obama is a Christian. In fact, it is wrong. The e-mail also spells the book's name "Kuran," though usually it is spelled Koran or Quran. Two press reports from Obama's swearing-in ceremony in January 2005 mention specifically that Obama took the oath of office by placing his hand on his own copy of the Bible. The Barack Obama campaign also confirmed that it was a Bible and that the book belonged to Obama. Vice President Dick Cheney, in his role as president of the Senate, administered the oath. After being raised outside of any particular faith tradition, Obama became a Christian in his mid 20s and is a member of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. (Obama gave what are arguably his most extended remarks on his faith at the "Call to Renewal" religious conference in 2006; read the speech here .) We suspect this false claim was inspired by the 2007 swearing-in of Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., an American convert to Islam and the first Muslim elected to Congress. Ellison used a Koran that once belonged to Thomas Jefferson, borrowing the rare book from the Library of Congress. It goes without saying that Ellison is not Obama. And with its intent to inflame, we find the e-mail's allegation not only false, but Pants-on-Fire wrong. UPDATE: Barack Obama resigned from Trinity United Church of Christ on May 31, 2008, after church pastor Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. made controversial remarks about U.S. foreign policy and other matters.

pomt-00018	Starbucks executive "believes white men are the root of all evil."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/08/blog-posting/no-starbucks-coo-never-said-men-are-root-all-evil/	Rosalind Brewer is the first woman and the first black American to hold the position of chief operating officer at Starbucks. Recent Facebook posts claim she’s also wary of the people who often serve in that role: white men. "Starbucks COO Rosalind Brewer has shocked shareholders after it was revealed she believes white men are the root of all evil," reads one post that appeared in Facebook groups like "The Liborants," "The Deplorables" and "LARGEST GROUP EVER! We need to 10000000 members to Make America Great Again!" on Nov. 5. The claim stems from an old story on News Punch, a website with the tagline "where mainstream fears to tread." The story, published Feb. 17, 2018, has this headline: "Starbucks COO: White Men Are Root Of All Evil." "Starbucks COO Rosalind Brewer has shocked shareholders after it was revealed she believes white men are the root of all evil," the story says. "According to a recently surfaced 2015 CNN interview, Brewer says she is extremely ‘triggered’ by the sight of white men in business." This story has also been shared on Facebook in recent days, and it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Sean Adl-Tabatabai, is listed at the bottom of the story as editor-in-chief of Your News Wire (that website, YourNewsWire.com, redirects to News Punch’s home page). In response to an email seeking more information about the claim, Adl-Tabatabai said: "That was an old story from YourNewsWire.com. I’m not sure why it has been appearing on social media again, but we have unpublished it now that it has been brought to our attention as its (sic) not something we now stand by." The story, which was pulled after PolitiFact’s query, linked to a Washington Post story from December 2015 with the headline: "Sam’s Club CEO called ‘racist’ for remarks on diversity." Before she moved to Starbucks, Brewer was at the helm of the Walmart chain. The Post story concerns comments she made in an interview with CNN that month that prompted the allegations of racism. During the interview, CNN anchor Poppy Harlow notes that Brewer is a rarity in "the corner office" as a minority, female CEO. "Where do you fall on who has to make the change and how it is going to happen so that there are more women like you represented in the top echelons of corporate America?" Harlow then asks. Brewer says it has to start with the top leadership at a company. "My executive team is very diverse, and I make that a priority. I demand it of my team and within the structure. And then, every now and then, you have to nudge your partners, and you have to speak up and speak out. And I try to use my platform for that. … I try to set an example. I mentor many women inside my company and outside the company because I think it’s important." Brewer then agrees with Harlow that diversity is important in hiring for top positions at a company. "And I talk to my suppliers about it. Just today I met with a supplier, and the entire other side of the table was all Caucasian males. That was interesting," Brewer says. "I decided not to talk about it directly with the folks in the room because there were actually no females, like, levels down. So I’m going to place a call to him." Her remarks led to hashtags like #boycottsamsclub and #boycottracistsamsclub, according to the Post. But while the comments may have been controversial, they don’t indicate that she thinks white men are "evil" or "the root of all evil." We rate this post Pants on Fire!

pomt-14822	Since he took office as Milwaukee County executive, "we have never raised" bus fares and "this year there’ll be a million route-miles more than there were five years ago."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/23/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-he-took-office-county-hasnt-raise/	With Democratic state Sen. Chris Larson entering the 2016 race for Milwaukee County Executive, incumbent Chris Abele is trying to show residents he has been -- per his campaign tagline -- "working for us for a change." In an Oct. 29, 2015 interview on WisconsinEye, Abele was asked about the impact borrowing $200 million for state highway funding would have in Milwaukee County. At the time, Scott Walker had just asked the Legislature to approve the borrowing to keep road projects on track. "Decisions like that necessitate related decisions that lead to the county right now, for instance, getting less in transit funding still than we did five years ago," Abele said. "But what I can tell you (public transit is) a priority to me." Then Abele shared this accomplishment: "This year there’ll be a million route miles more than there were five years ago and we have never raised fares." He echoed the claim in a TV ad released Nov. 17, 2015 by his re-election campaign, which declared: "Chris Abele expanded the (bus) lines without increasing the fares." Is Abele right that, thanks to his actions, fares have been kept flat and route miles increased since he took office? Background on fares and routes Abele was elected in April 2011 and is up for reelection in April 2016. It’s the county executive’s job to propose the transit budget. In the 10 years before Abele took office, a period that includes Gov. Scott Walker’s time in the job and the last of Tom Ament’s tenure, fares increased and routes were cut nearly every year. Fares rose from $1.50 in 2001 to $2.25 by 2011. The total number of miles traveled by county buses fell from nearly 22 million in 2001 to about 17.1 million in 2011, a drop of 22 percent. In 2011, soon after Abele took office, the state made a 10 percent cut in transit aid. Abele obtained federal funds to keep fares flat and routes running Where do things stand now? His team sent us budget documents from the Milwaukee County Transit System that showed fares at $2.25 in 2011 and the proposed fare for 2016 still at $2.25. We double checked and fares did not go up and then back down in that time frame. So, fares stayed the same for the last five years. The same documents backed up Abele’s route miles claim. In 2015, Milwaukee County buses are projected to travel 18,313,725 miles, that’s over a million more than five years ago. The 2016 budget estimates route miles will increase again, to 18,416,499. The transit system calculates the route miles by multiplying the length of each route by the number of times the route runs in a day, multiplied by the days in the year, taking into account weekends and other days when busses run fewer trips. Most of the additional miles were added in the last year: Year Route miles Mile increase from 2011 2011 17,107,116 2012 17,369,736 262,620 2013 17,244,868 137,752 2014 17,457,798 350,682 2015 18,313,725 1,206,609 The large increase mostly attributed to the addition of three new routes that go from the central city to the suburbs. But they were not Abele’s doing. These routes were created as part of a 2014 settlement between the state and the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin, Inc. and Milwaukee Inner-city Congregations Allied for Hope. The lawsuit originally sought to block reconstruction of the Zoo Interchange, saying transportation officials discriminated against urban minorities by not including improvements to public transit in $1.7 billion project. Route miles are expected to increase another 100,000 miles in 2016, due to increased funds in the transit budget from Abele and the Milwaukee County Board. Our rating Abele said since he has been Milwaukee County executive, "we have never raised" bus fares and "this year there’ll be a million route-miles more than there were five years ago." He backed up the claim with transit system budget reports that showed constant fare prices and a million mile increase in route miles. But in stating the claim, he gives himself too much credit for the new routes that largely generated the extra miles. Those were the result of a lawsuit against the state.

pomt-03885	A "legacy of taxing and borrowing … crippled the economy we inherited two years ago."	false	/florida/statements/2013/mar/05/rick-scott/rick-scott-blames-legacy-taxing-and-borrowing-poor/	During his 2013 State of the State speech, Florida Gov. Rick Scott defended his record on the economy and the state’s fiscal condition during his first two years in office. "Our Florida Families First budget" represents "responsible stewardship of taxpayer money," Scott, a Republican, said in the address. "Washington, D.C., could learn a few budget lessons from Florida. The contrast between our state and the nation’s capital is remarkable. Now is not the time to turn back to the legacy of taxing and borrowing that crippled the economy we inherited two years ago. We must stay the course for economic growth and job creation." We wondered whether Scott was justified in saying that a "legacy of taxing and borrowing … crippled the economy" he inherited in 2010. We should note that we are analyzing this claim using the assumption that Scott is referring to the state’s economy when he talks about the "legacy of taxing and borrowing." His office confirmed that he was referring to Florida's economy as the one he "inherited" in January 2011, not the nation’s. As evidence, they pointed us to statistics showing Florida's debt levels increased through 2010 but then declined. To check Scott's claim, we contacted a half dozen experts on the Florida economy, primarily academic economists and analysts with financial firms. These experts were unanimous: Problems of taxing and borrowing weren’t the major causes of the severe recession the Sunshine State is still struggling out of. Real estate was, exacerbated by the reach of the national recession. Florida real estate values appreciated by 4.1 percent annually from 1995 to 2000, and then by 11.3 percent annually between 2000 and 2003. But when the bust came, it hit hard. By 2010, nearly 14 percent of Florida home loans were in foreclosure, edging out Nevada for the highest in the nation. The serious delinquency rate for home loans in Florida peaked in the third quarter of 2010 at nearly 20 percent -- almost twice the rate of Arizona and California, two of the other hardest-hit states. "Most economists -- maybe all economists -- think that the bursting of the housing bubble and the global financial crisis were far and away the largest factors crippling the Florida economy," said Bill Seyfried, professor of economics at Rollins College in Winter Park. "State economic policy played a minimal role." Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, agreed. "Florida’s severe housing collapse, the seeds of which were sown during Jeb Bush’s governorship, combined with the national recession to deliver the Florida economy a devastating one-two punch from 2007 to 2009," he said. "Tax revenues obviously fell during the recession, which you would expect to happen in any state, but there was not a substantial erosion in the state’s fiscal position sufficient to cause a downgrade in the state’s credit rating." Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness, said the combination of the severe national recession, a housing bust and a financial crisis amounted to a perfect storm for the state. "As 401(k)s turned into 201(k)s," fewer retirees could move to Florida, Snaith said. This, in turn, dealt a body blow to the construction and real estate sectors. "This tied the Florida economy’s hands behind its back," Snaith said. "Those factors, more than anything, made the recession harder to recover from. … The source of the state’s woes certainly was not borrowing and spending." Meanwhile, tourism, a backbone of Florida’s economy, couldn’t last for long in this economic environment, said Paul M. Mason, an economist at the University of North Florida. The decline in housing values -- exacerbated by investors shifting money from housing to oil funds when petroleum prices surged in the summer of 2008 -- "made people feel less wealthy, putting a major damper on tourism from both inside and outside the state," he said. One lesson of the last recession is that the Florida economy is deeply intertwined with the national economy, experts say. "Whatever factors contributed to the last national recession and its aftermath also contributed to the state’s recession and its aftermath," said Joseph DeSalvo, an economist at the University of South Florida. As for tax rates, they would be "an extremely low-rated cause of economic decline," said Elizabeth Strom, an urban and regional planning professor at the University of South Florida. "For Florida, the national recession coupled with our economic dependence on real estate development and the huge speculative bubble that popped alongside national economic recession would have far stronger explanatory power." There may be one silver lining for Florida, said Scott J. Brown, senior vice president and chief economist at Raymond James Financial, based in St. Petersburg. "Areas of the country that had larger housing bubbles, such as Florida, were going to have larger corrections," Brown said. "However, with housing recovering in most areas of the country, Florida has more room for improvement in housing than most other states. Bigger bubble, bigger bust, bigger (eventual) recovery." Our ruling Scott blamed a "legacy of taxing and borrowing" for the poor state economy he inherited. But the experts we contacted said that fiscal matters were a small factor, if at all. Real estate, the national recession, and their impacts on such key sectors as construction and tourism were the overwhelming causes. We rate Scott’s claim False. Update: Shortly after we published this fact-check, we received a response from Scott's office. We included it here, but it did not change our rating.

pomt-03579	Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev is buried "not far" from President Kennedy’s grave.	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/17/john-depetro/talk-radio-host-john-depetro-says-boston-marathon-/	The announcement on May 9, 2013, that a burial site had been found for the body of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev led to speculation about the location of the grave. The next day, after media outlets confirmed that Tsarnaev had been interred in a Muslim cemetery 15 miles from Richmond, Va., WPRO talk show host John DePetro weighed in. DePetro, at first, seemed to ask his talk-show audience if the site was near John F. Kennedy's grave. But then he simply declared to his listeners that it was. "You know, in a way, think of who else is there. That is, President Kennedy is buried not far from there, in Virginia," he said. Kennedy is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. So was Tsarnaev really interred nearby? When we contacted DePetro, he said he wasn't sure what the distance was. We used the Google Maps Distance Calculator to find the actual span between Kennedy's grave at Arlington and the Al-Barzakh Cemetery on Sadie Lane in Doswell, Virginia. Driving distance: 87 miles. Bee-line distance: 74 miles. That's about 55,817 casket lengths. When we informed DePetro of the distance and asked if he was still bothered, he wrote in an e-mail, "Yes. Insult to bury him so close to JFK. Johnston landfill was my choice or out to sea." Our ruling Saying that Kennedy is buried "not far" from Tsarnaev is like saying Newport is not far from the eastern tip of Cape Cod, that Rhode Island's State House is not far from Derry, N.H., or that the site of the Boston Marathon bombing is "not far" from the the southernmost tip of Narragansett, R.I. And to say that such a distance should somehow spark offense strikes us as mildly ridiculous, so we rate his statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-07105	The ACLU didn't call for an investigation (of the Newark police department), they called for an immediate federal monitor.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/22/cory-booker/newark-mayor-cory-booker-says-aclu-sought-monitor-/	Newark Mayor Cory Booker says he’s "relieved and enthusiastic" about working with the U.S. Department of Justice as it probes allegations made by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey against the city police department. That wasn’t always the case. Nine months ago, Booker and Newark Police Director Garry McCarthy criticized an ACLU petition to the Justice Department calling for outside intervention to deal with more than 400 allegations of excessive force, brutality and other claims against Newark police. Booker now says that what he was really resistant to in September 2010 was that "the ACLU didn’t call for an investigation, they called for an immediate federal monitor," according to his May 10 interview with Jami Floyd on the Brian Lehrer radio show at WNYC-FM. WNYC’s Floyd called Booker on his apparent change of opinion as she segued from a discussion about the city’s weekend peace summit into the Department of Justice petition: "You know I’ve got to ask, the DOJ yesterday announcing its investigation into the Newark Police Department back in September when the NJCLU Civil Liberties Union requested intervention, I think it’s fair to say you and your police chief were resistant to that idea, and yesterday you sounded like you thought it it was a good thing," Floyd said to Booker. Booker responded: "Well, actually, what we were specifically resistant to is the ACLU didn’t call for an investigation, they called for an immediate federal monitor, which was almost to the point of being ridiculous, so we immediately reached out to the DOJ and asked them to help us to get this cloud off of our police department, but more importantly, when I started talking to Tom Perez’s team we realized very quickly that the DOJ had worked with many police departments around the country helping them to improve their practices." Perez is the assistant attorney general for Civil Rights. Really? PolitiFact New Jersey has found legal documents that say otherwise. The ACLU on Sept. 9, 2010, filed a petition with the Justice Department. The document’s first sentence reads "The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey of New Jersey ("ACLU-NJ" or "Petitioner") respectfully requests that the Special Litigation Section, acting pursuant to its authority under 42 U.S.C. § 14141, commence an investigation into the Newark, New Jersey Police Department ("NPD")." After seven paragraphs summarizing alleged abuses by the Newark Police Department, the petition then states "On behalf of the people who live in, work in, and visit the City of Newark, New Jersey, we implore the Civil Rights Division to investigate the NPD." Use of a federal monitor is mentioned as an option in addition to an investigation, in the final pages of the petition: "For all of the foregoing reasons, the Petitioners respectfully ask the United States Department of Justice, Special Litigation Section, to forthwith commence an investigation into the Newark, New Jersey Police Department. Thereafter, DOJ should impose remedial steps upon the NPD, including but not limited to: (a) alterations to the citizen complaints and internal affairs processes; (b) an enhanced risk management system; (c) enhanced training; (d) alterations to the disciplinary process; and (e) an independent monitor to oversee compliance." PolitiFact New Jersey asked the ACLU about Booker’s comments on the radio broadcast. "It’s simply not true," said Alexander Shalom, the ACLU’s policy counsel. "The petition is pretty clear in its language. The first page of the petition requests the Special Litigation Section commence an investigation into the police department." So what does Booker have to say about this? He declined to comment to PolitiFact New Jersey, according to spokeswoman Anne Torres. To review: The mayor tried to downplay the controversy by saying the ACLU called for a federal monitor of the Newark Police Department instead of requesting an investigation. Yet the first sentence of the ACLU’s petition to the Department of Justice requests an investigation. We rate Booker's statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06049	"More than a quarter of mortgage borrowers are underwater, and 11 percent of all homes are vacant."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/12/marcia-fudge/marcia-fudge-says-25-mortgage-borrowers-are-under-/	Mortgage foreclosure problems have been a top concern the past several years for many politicians including, Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge. Fudge, of Warrensville Heights in suburban Cleveland, took to the House of Representatives floor on Dec. 15 to call for legislation to revitalize neighborhoods plagued by vacant and abandoned homes. "Remnants of the foreclosure crisis linger everywhere," said Fudge, citing home values pummeled by the plague of blighted and abandoned houses. "More than a quarter of mortgage borrowers are underwater and 11 percent of all homes are vacant." Fudge’s statistics on underwater mortgages and home vacancies certainly sounded alarming so we asked Fudge’s office where she got them. According to spokeswoman Laura Allen, Fudge got her data on underwater mortgages from the Zillow real estate information and sales service. The group’s number crunchers found that in the third quarter of 2011, 28.6 of the nation’s mortgage borrowers owed more money on their houses than their property was worth. Borrowers can end up underwater on their mortgages if their homes decline in value or if their mortgage debt increases. Sometimes the two factors combine. Negative equity makes borrowers more vulnerable to foreclosure because it makes it harder to sell or refinance their houses if they can’t keep current on their mortgage payments. Underwater borrowers who can still afford their mortgage payments sometimes walk away from the loss and allow their homes to enter foreclosure. Such "strategic defaults" add to the glut of vacancies and further drag down home prices. Statistics that Zillow provided to Fudge’s office indicated 41.5 percent of single-family homes with mortgages in the Cleveland metropolitan area were underwater during the third quarter of 2011. To compute its statistics, Zillow looks at the total amount of loans taken out by a homeowner at the time of purchase and compares it to the current value of the home. It obtains its raw data from county recorders’ offices around the nation. But those statistics only look at the borrowed amounts and the property valuations. A Zillow spokeswoman acknowledged the statistics don’t reflect equity that a longer-term homeowner could build up over years of making payments. We also checked with another organization, CoreLogic, which incorporates the extra home equity accrued by longer-term homeowners into the negative equity statistics it compiles. CoreLogic’s latest study found that 22.1 percent of all mortgaged residential properties were underwater during the last quarter of 2011. Fudge obtained her home vacancy numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau. Its data on the nation’s housing showed an 11.4 percent vacancy rate in 2010: 14,988,438 empty residences out of a total of 131,704,730. But further examination of that national data reveals that 31 percent of those empty homes were "for seasonal, recreational or occasional use," 27.6 percent were for vacant rental properties, and 12.7 percent were unoccupied homes for sale. In hard-hit Cuyahoga County, Fudge’s home county and Ohio’s most populous, 2010 Census figures showed a vacancy rate of 12.3 percent, with 42 percent of those vacancies for rent and 12.6 percent for sale. A mere 3.2 percent of Cuyahoga County’s vacancies consisted of seasonal or recreational property. So while the 11 percent figure for vacancies is on point, it appears there are many reasons homes can be unoccupied. So has the foreclosure crises has had a lasting impact? In her floor speech, she mentions it as she discussed "remnants of the foreclosure crisis." To examine whether the foreclosure crisis actually boosted the vacancy rate, we looked at national data from the 2000 Census, which was taken long before the foreclosure tsunami hit. It showed a 9 percent vacancy rate that year - or 10,424,540 vacancies out of a total 115,904,641 units. A comparison of data from the two Censuses shows a the proportions of vacant units for sale and for rent both increased slightly since 2000. Over that 10-year period, the ratio of vacant homes that were for sale rose from 11.6 percent to 12.7 percent. The ratio of rental vacancies rose from 25.1 to 27.6 percent. A higher proportion of the vacant homes in 2000 were categorized as being for "seasonal, recreational or occasional use" - 34.3 percent. U.S. Census Bureau statistician Melisa Kresin said the Census Bureau does not measure foreclosures, and its survey of vacant homes would not accurately measure them. She noted that homes can be vacant for numerous reasons, and that many people continue to occupy their homes while the foreclosure process is underway. She attributed some of the increased vacancies to the rise in multigenerational households. "Once a child graduates, there is a greater chance now that it will move in with parents instead of getting an apartment," said Kresin. "There are lots of factors that go into these rates." Fudge’s claim is partially accurate. The Zillow number she used for mortgage borrowers who are underwater does exceed 25 percent, although that data doesn’t consider payment history that could affect the results. CoreLogic’s negative equity analysis produced a smaller number by using a different methodology. That number was less than 25 percent, but in the ballpark. Her statement that 11 percent of the nation’s homes are vacant is technically accurate. But there are many reasons that those homes are unoccupied and a researcher for the source of her figure, the U.S. Census Bureau, cautioned that its survey of vacant homes would not accurately measure foreclosures. And, the fact that 9 percent of homes were unoccupied in the 2000 survey, long before the foreclosure crisis took hold, indicates a large proportion of the vacancies Fudge cites are not foreclosure-related. That’s important information that puts her claim into context. On the Truth-O-Meter, Fudge’s statement rates Half True.	None	Marcia Fudge	None	None	None	2012-01-12T06:00:00	2011-12-15	['None']
pomt-12373	"At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’ "	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/04/donald-trump/donald-trumps-tweet-misleads-about-london-mayors-r/	Saturday night, President Donald Trump responded to the London Bridge and market attacks with solidarity for London and the United Kingdom. Sunday morning, Trump had harsh words for the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. "At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’ " Trump wrote June 4. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The London mayor did use those words in a morning-after news conference about the van and stabbing rampage. But in no way, shape or form did Khan say them about the terrorist attack. When Khan said there was "no reason to be alarmed," he was talking about the increased police presence around the city that residents and tourists would notice. Khan condemned the attacks at London Bridge and Borough Market. "I am appalled and furious that these cowardly terrorists would deliberately target innocent Londoners and bystanders enjoying their Saturday night," Khan said June 4. "There can be no justification for the acts of these terrorists. And I’m quite clear that we will never let them win nor will we allow them to cower our city or Londoners." Khan talked about the stepped-up police presence three different times in the news conference, and twice he said people should not be alarmed by it. Here's one of the comments in context, via the BBC: "Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. "No reason to be alarmed. One of the things the police and all of us need to do is make sure we're as safe as we possibly can be. "I'm reassured that we are one of the safest global cities in the world, if not the safest global city in the world, but we always evolve and review ways to make sure that we remain as safe as we possibly can." The comment came up again when Khan was asked to give his message to Londoners and visitors (go to the 6:50 mark). In addition to saying they should remain calm and vigilant, he said, "You will see an increased police presence today, including armed officers, uniformed officers. There's no reason to be alarmed by this. We are the safest global city in the world." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com At another point in the news conference, Khan said he did not want the general elections Thursday postponed as a result of the attacks, and the threat level remained "severe." The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It’s probable that Trump fired off his tweets after watching Fox & Friends, where pundits discussed Khan’s comments in the same manner around the same time. Asked about Trump’s tweet, a spokesperson for Khan told NBC News, "The mayor is busy working with the police, emergency services, and the government to coordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack and provide leadership and reassurance to Londoners and visitors to our city. He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police — including armed officers — on the streets." Our ruling Trump tweeted, "At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’ " Trump portrayed Khan as an official with his head in the sand about the attacks that disrupted his city. The reality is the president plucked five words from the mayor’s longer message that condemned the terrorist acts and explained why Londoners would see an increased police presence in the coming days. Khan was not saying there is "no reason to be alarmed," period, by the attack -- he was pre-empting concerns about what law enforcement presence might mean in the days to come.

pomt-06916	Says Ronald Reagan "repeatedly talked about how irresponsible it would be to allow the full faith and credit of the United States to be impaired in any kind of way."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/22/barack-obama/ronald-reagan-talks-about-debt-ceiling/	With much glee, Democrats have seized on old audio recordings of President Ronald Reagan talking about the debt limit. House Democrats have even posted a snippet on YouTube. Here's what the Gipper had to say on the matter back in 1986: "Unfortunately, Congress consistently brings the government to the edge of default before facing its responsibility. This brinkmanship threatens the holders of government bonds and those who rely on Social Security and veterans benefits. Interest rates would skyrocket, instability would occur in financial markets, and the federal deficit would soar. The United States has a special responsibility to itself and the world to meet its obligations. It means we have a well-earned reputation for reliability and credibility -- two things that set us apart from much of the world." President Barack Obama, meanwhile, invoked Reagan when he answered a question from NPR on why negotiations to increase the debt ceiling have taken so long. Obama said it was more than just one thing. "You've got some members of the Republican Party who've been downplaying the consequences of default. The irony is, you know, Ronald Reagan, I think, when he was president, repeatedly talked about how irresponsible it would be to allow the full faith and credit of the United States to be impaired in any kind of way. I think that there is some politics. And compromising with me, among some Republican leaders, is bad politics for them," he said on July 21, 2011. Intrigued by the audio files going around the Internet, we decided to fact-check Obama's statement that Reagan repeatedly talked about avoiding debt limit showdowns. Reagan made the comments quoted above in a radio address to the nation on Sept. 26, 1987. But Reagan also laid out other principles for Congress in that address: cut spending, leave the defense budget alone, don't raise taxes. (Read the entire address via the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.) "For those who say further responsible spending reductions are not possible, they are wrong. For those who say the only choice is undermining our national security at a time when the United States is close to an agreement with the Soviet Union on reducing nuclear weapons, they are wrong. For those who say more taxes will solve our deficit problem, they are wrong. Every time Congress increases taxes, the deficit does not decrease, spending increases. It's time for a clear and consistent policy to reduce the federal budget deficit," he said. Looking for more examples of Reagan "repeatedly" warning about the debt ceiling,we also ran across a letter Reagan wrote in 1983 to then-Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, R-Tenn., asking for help. (The Washington Post posted the letter to its website.) "This country now possesses the strongest credit in the world," Reagan wrote. "The full consequences of a default – or even the serious prospect of default – by the United States are impossible to predict and awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United States would have substantial effects on the domestic financial markets and the value of the dollar in exchange markets. The Nation can ill afford to allow such a result. The risks, the costs, the disruptions, and the incalculable damage lead me to but one conclusion: the Senate must pass this legislation before the Congress adjourns." Interestingly, we also found statements from Reagan supporting changes to the tax code that increased revenues. That's a major sticking point in today's negotiations between Obama and Republicans. In a lengthy 1982 speech, he noted that some people called the bill he favored "the largest tax increase in history." But Reagan said it was tax reform, not a tax increase. "Of the entire $99 billion (in new tax revenue), $32 billion is collection of tax presently owed under the present laws and which is not being paid," Reagan said. "Now, to all of you who are paying your tax, simple fairness says we should collect from those who are freeloading. Roughly $48 billion of the $99 billion represents closing off special-interest loopholes which have resulted in unintended tax advantages for some -- not all -- taxpayers, some who are financially well able to pay their share. Now, this is also a matter of simple fairness. So, more than 80 percent of the tax bill is not new tax at all, but is better collecting and correcting of flaws in the system." We reached Reagan biographer Lou Cannon and asked him about Reagan's comments on raising the debt ceiling and avoiding default. He noted the historical trend that, regardless of party, presidents have traditionally raised the debt ceiling, while members of Congress -- like Sen. Barack Obama back in 2006 -- balked at raising it. But Reagan also had a strong sense that the country's creditworthiness was important, Cannon said. "On matters like extending the full faith and credit of the government, on paying its bills, Reagan was a real conservative, in the old sense. Most of the true conservatives in those days wouldn't have considered defaulting on their debts." He also noted that Reagan wasn't opposed to legislative compromises, getting spending cuts when he could. "He was a practical person," Cannon said. "He would say, let's take some this year and come back next year and take some more." Obama said that Reagan "repeatedly talked about how irresponsible it would be to allow the full faith and credit of the United States to be impaired in any kind of way." We found two examples and a Reagan expert said they typified his approach to the federal debt. Reagan talked about other things more, like keeping taxes low and funding defense. But his remarks on the debt ceiling are real and apparently heartfelt. We rate Obama's statement Mostly True.

pomt-09656	Under the Democratic health plan, families "will be forced to spend an additional $2,100 a year to keep their current health care."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/01/mike-pence/rep-mike-pence-says-democratic-health-plan-would-/	One of the big questions for health care reform has been how the legislation would affect insurance premiums for consumers. On Nov. 30, the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, released a detailed analysis on how health insurance premiums might be affected by the Senate Democrats' health care bill. The CBO is a nonpartisan budget agency that calculates how much bills in Congress will cost the government. Their budget projections often make for solid political ammunition from proponents and opponents of various bills. So Republican Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana cited the report as evidence that the Democrats' plan would drive up family premiums. "The CBO has confirmed what every American already knows, the Democrats' plan for a government takeover of health care will dramatically raise health care costs on working families," Pence said in a Nov. 30 press release. "This latest CBO study reveals that the health care bill before the U.S. Senate will raise individual insurance premiums by up to 13 percent. That means every family that refuses the government's one-size-fits-all plan, will be forced to spend an additional $2,100 a year to keep their current health care." The key qualifier in there -- likely missed by many not versed in insurance parlance -- is "individual" insurance premiums. The CBO broke its analysis of effects on premiums into three categories: • those in the small group market (generally people who get their insurance through businesses with up to 50 employees), which would make up about 13 percent of the total insurance market; • those in the large group market, which would account for about 70 percent of people; • those in the nongroup market, who would purchase their insurance as an individual through the government's health insurance "exchange," which may or may not include a public option. Pence is talking about that last group of people, the nongroup market, which is expected to grow to about 17 percent of the insurance market in 2016. According to the report, the CBO estimates that the average premium per person in new nongroup policies would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the average premium for nongroup coverage under current law. More specifically, the average premiums per policy in the nongroup market in 2016 would be roughly $5,800 for single policies (up from $5,500 under current law) and $15,200 for family policies (up from $13,100 under current law). In other words, Pence is right that for some of this subset of Americans, their premiums could rise as much as 13 percent. But Pence fails to mention two key qualifiers. First, as the CBO report notes, the majority of nongroup enrollees (about 57 percent) would receive federal insurance subsidies, which on average would cover about two-thirds of the total premium. So for nongroup people getting subsidies, the amount they'd pay in premiums would be about 57 percent lower, on average, than what they would pay for nongroup coverage under current law. There's another flaw in Pence's statement. He says families would pay $2,100 more to keep "their current health care." In fact, much of what is driving up the cost of premiums in the nongroup market is that the government would require insurance companies in the exchange to offer a broader scope of benefits than most individual plans now include, an "essential health benefits" package that would match the benefits provided in most employer plans. So new nongroup policies would be required to cover a lot of things they don't currently cover -- things like maternity care, prescription drugs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment. Bottom line, it may cost more, but those people will be getting more insurance, and their out-of-pocket expense for medical needs should be smaller. According to the CBO report, an "apples to apples" comparison of the average price of equivalent insurance under the Democrats' plan would translate to an average premium of about 7 to 10 percent less than under current law. But our bigger problem with the Pence statement is the implication that the 13 percent rise in family health insurance premiums would apply to a larger group of people than it actually would. He says it would dramatically raise healthcare costs on working families. For the vast majority of people -- the five out of six nonelderly people who get their insurance through their employer -- the Democrats' plan would have a much smaller effect on premiums, the CBO concluded. In the small group market, employers with 50 or fewer workers, the CBO estimates the change in premiums would range from an increase of 1 percent to a decrease of 2 percent in 2016. In the large group market, premiums are projected to be zero to 3 percent lower in 2016 (relative to current law). In his press release, Pence takes a poke at President Barack Obama for failing to stick to his campaign promise to lower family premiums by $2,500. And on that front, Pence is accurate. The CBO analysis of the Senate Democrats' plan shows no such savings. We dealt with that claim separately on our Obameter, which tracks the progress of Obama's campaign promises. And we ruled it Stalled. But in this item, we're focused on Pence's claim that under the Democratic health plan, families "will be forced to spend an additional $2,100 a year to keep their current health care." That's only true for the roughly 8 percent of the market that purchases nongroup plans through the exchange and who don't receive a federal health insurance subsidy. According to the CBO, the vast majorty of working families -- who get their insurance through a large employer -- would actually see a slight decrease in premiums. It also does not account for the fact that the government would require individual policies to include better (more) coverage. And so we rule Pence's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f1db323b-6621-4343-a2e4-27037bc8f860	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-12-01T17:29:29	2009-11-30	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

Here are the seven planks listed in the meme, which to today’s ear sound more like Democratic talking points: 1. Provide federal assistance to low-income communities; 2. Protect Social Security; 3. Provide asylum for refugees; 4. Extend minimum wage; 5. Improve unemployment benefit system so it covers more people; 6. Strengthen labor laws so workers can more easily join a union; 7. Assure equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. We wondered whether the meme accurately describes these elements of the 1956 platform, and if so, whether the 1956 document contrasts sharply with the most recent party platform in 2012. So we took a closer look. What the 1956 platform said We located a copy of the official party platform from 1956, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was running (successfully, as it turned out) for his second term as president. All told, the meme is generally accurate in portraying these seven elements of the 1956 platform, with some caveats. On federal assistance to low-income communities, the 1956 platform said the party would "promote fully the Republican-sponsored Rural Development Program to broaden the operation and increase the income of low income farm families and help tenant farmers." On protecting Social Security, the platform touted the Eisenhower administration’s extension of Social Security to 10 million more workers and benefits hikes for 6.5 million Americans. On refugees, the platform spotlighted the administration’s work in sponsoring the Refugee Relief Act "to provide asylum for thousands of refugees, expellees and displaced persons," promising its "wholehearted support" for additional efforts. M. Christine Anderson, a Xavier University historian, noted that many refugees were coming from communist countries in Eastern Europe, so this wasn't an especially controversial issue during the Cold War era. On the minimum wage, the platform notes that the Eisenhower administration raised the minimum wage for more than 2 million workers. It urged extending minimum-wage protections "to as many more workers as is possible and practicable." On improving the unemployment benefit system, the 1956 platform touted the administration’s actions to bring unemployment insurance to 4 million additional workers, and backed efforts to "improve the effectiveness of the unemployment insurance system." On strengthening unions, the platform says the "protection of the right of workers to organize into unions and to bargain collectively is the firm and permanent policy of the Eisenhower Administration." That’s full-throated rhetoric in support of unions -- but the policy reality is a bit more nuanced, said Jennifer Delton, a Skidmore College historian and author of Rethinking the 1950s. The platform did not support unions’ key agenda item that year -- a repeal of states’ ability to pass "right to work" laws that would ban compulsory union membership. On equal pay for equal work regardless of sex, the platform says the Eisenhower administration will "continue to fight … (to) assure equal pay for equal work regardless of sex." What the 2012 platform says The party’s 2012 platform is pretty different, both in tone and substance. On federal assistance to low-income communities, the 2012 platform takes a much more skeptical view. "The federal government’s entire system of public assistance should be reformed to ensure that it promotes work," the 2012 platform says, arguing that the system has become overly bureaucratized and discourages work. The 2012 platform also takes a shot at federal low-income housing policy, saying the government "has spent billions more on poorly designed and ineffective housing assistance programs." On Social Security, the platform says current retirees or those approaching retirement should continue to receive Social Security as currently configured. However, it goes on to say that demographic and financial challenges mean that the program is "long overdue for major change, not just another legislative stopgap that postpones a day of reckoning," including the possibility of "personal investment accounts as supplements to the system." The 2012 platform doesn’t address refugees specifically, but it does address immigration. It criticizes President Barack Obama for creating "a backdoor amnesty program unrecognized in law (and) granting worker authorization to illegal aliens." It also says that "granting amnesty only rewards and encourages more law-breaking," and it promises to "create humane procedures to encourage illegal aliens to return home voluntarily, while enforcing the law against those who overstay their visas." The 2012 platform doesn’t mention the minimum wage specifically, but it does place an emphasis on free-market business practices rather than government regulation of labor markets, laying the blame for the nation’s weak economic recovery on "unprecedented uncertainty in the American free enterprise system due to the overreaching policies of the current administration." Even accounting for the nuances of the 1956 platform, the clearest contrast between the two platforms may be in their approach to labor unions. The 2012 platform offers no rhetorical niceties, accusing the Obama administration of "clinging to antiquated notions of confrontation and concentrating power in the Washington offices of union elites" and of turning the National Labor Relations Board into "a partisan advocate for Big Labor, using threats and coercion outside the law to attack businesses." The 2012 platform doesn’t mention two of the meme’s seven items from 1956 -- unemployment benefits and equal pay for women. The bottom line, then, is that on most of these issues, the GOP moved to the right between 1956 and 2012, though the degree of that shift has varied somewhat issue by issue. What historians say We asked scholars whether the contrast between the two platforms is noteworthy, and they generally agreed that it was. Delton noted that the Republican Party in the 1950s was divided between moderates (including Eisenhower) and conservatives. She said the moderates controlled the process of platform-writing in 1956, but they threw a few bones to conservatives in certain portions of the document. For instance, the platform said the government wouldn’t sign a treaty or enter into an international agreement in violation of individual rights -- an issue that continues to energize conservatives decades later -- and there’s a plank about a balanced budget, which was seen as a conservative position. The seven items listed in the meme were supported by moderates, Delton said. At the time, she said, "conservatives would have focused, with horror, on the very items the meme highlights." Eisenhower was facing a Democratic Congress in 1956 and didn’t want to try to reverse the New Deal, Anderson said. "If the point is that Eisenhower was not as extreme as Republicans today, it is accurate." Our ruling The meme says the 1956 Republican Party platform supported equal pay, the minimum wage, asylum for refugees, protections for unions and more. That’s generally correct. However, it’s worth noting that other elements of the 1956 platform were considered conservative for that era. Also, some of the issues have changed considerably between 1956 and 2012, such as the shift from focusing on post-war refugees to focusing on illegal immigration. The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-10-28T16:40:01	2014-10-28	['None']
pomt-01248	Georgia has the country’s second highest number of fraudulent tax refund claims.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/nov/14/johnny-isakson/Isakson-off-about-income-tax-fraud-ranking/	Many of us wonder whether we’re exposing ourselves to identity theft with credit card and debit card purchases, especially after security breaches at some big-box retailers. Identity theft is generally considered the fastest-growing crime in America, so that’s probably not so far-fetched. But in reality, authorities say, identity thieves for the past several years have focused increasingly on income tax fraud. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it paid $5.2 billion in fraudulent refunds in 2013 and caught an additional $24.2 billion of such refunds, according to a September report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Last month, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators -- including Georgia’s Johnny Isakson -- called on IRS Commissioner John Koskinsen to update Congress on the agency’s efforts to stop tax refund fraud related to identity theft. "Tax frauds costs hardworking Americans billions of dollars and further undermines taxpayers’ confidence in our taxpayer system," said Isakson, a member of the Senate Finance Committee who is set to announce re-election plans next week. In a press release, Isakson said he has continually pressed the IRS on the issue, noting that "Georgia ranks second-highest in the country in the number of fraudulent tax refund claims." Could that be right? We decided to check. Amanda Maddox, Isakson’s spokeswoman, said the statement was based on data from the Federal Trade Commission and backed up with information from the IRS. The FTC report that Maddox supplied us is based on "unverified complaints reported by consumers" during 2013. The report shows Florida had the highest number of identity theft complaints per capita at 192.9 per 1,000 residents. Georgia was second with 134.1 per thousand, or 13,402, followed by California, Michigan and Nevada. But that includes all types of identity theft complaints. It also doesn’t include any individual state data on complaints about identity theft related to income tax fraud -- what Isakson’s talking about. Maddox told PolitiFact that information she’d just received from the IRS showed Georgia ranked third in per-capita tax-related identity theft (at 0.7 percent in both 2012 and 2014). Tax fraud from identity theft with Georgia connections has made headlines both inside and outside the state. In April, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced that 56 people had been charge or already pleaded guilty in a stolen ID and tax fraud scheme based out of Statesboro. Just last month, a Georgia man pleaded guilty to his role in a $2 million tax refund conspiracy that used state prison inmates’ identities to create bogus tax returns in 2010 and 2011. Three women – all from Georgia – had already pleaded guilty to wire fraud in the case. In January, the IRS announced that Georgia, Florida and the District of Columbia had been chosen for the pilot program because they see "the highest per-capita percentage of tax-related identity theft." Yet Mark Green, an IRS spokesman in Atlanta, said: "There is no ranking per se." The IRS does not have any state-level data that would show exactly how Georgia, or any state, fares in the overall problem, he said. Maddox provided a spreadsheet from April 2013, which she said the IRS gave to the Senate Special Committee on Aging. The spreadsheet, which the IRS confirmed was its data, showed that Georgia ranked No. 3 in enforcement action against identity theft, with 156 enforcement actions. But the data do not match up with other IRS data, including the presumptive top three problem spots targeted with the pilot program. The spreadsheet shows the top three, in order, are Florida (443), Puerto Rico (374) and then Georgia. The District of Columbia, part of the pilot program for supposedly having a serious problem, shows just one enforcement action. That ties it with five other jurisdictions for the least enforcement actions taken in fiscal 2013. Karen Barney, a spokeswoman for the Identity Resource Center in San Diego, said Georgia was second behind Florida for the past three years in complaints about identity theft involving government documents or benefits fraud. This category of identity fraud includes income tax fraud, she said. Our conclusion: Isakson’s claim that Georgia ranks second when it comes to fraudulent tax refund claims is based on at least one federal report. But that report examines complaints, not verifiable incidents. To be certain, Georgia has a serious problem. The senator would have been accurate if he had said as much, or said that Georgia shows near the top of states with such problems. But Isakson misreads that data to show a specific rank where none exists. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2014-11-14T00:00:00	2014-11-21	['None']
pomt-08397	"Fiorina's plan would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/22/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-carly-fiorina-would-penalize/	A new ad from California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer takes a broad-brush approach to painting Republican opponent Carly Fiorina as extreme. "Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons, and that's reckless and dangerous. She's for risky new oil drilling that could threaten our jobs. Fiorina's plan would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare, which would devastate seniors. And she'd make abortion a crime. No wonder Fiorina is endorsed by Sarah Palin. Carly Fiorina, just too extreme for California." The Fiorina campaign blasted the ad. "We demand that she immediately remove this ad from the airwaves and apologize to Carly, and California voters, for not only this deliberate and blatant distortion of reality, but also for her refusal to have an honest and serious debate about the issues during this crucial time for our nation," said campaign manager Marty Wilson in a written statement. The Boxer campaign said they're standing by the ad. Both campaigns invited us to fact-check it. Here, we wanted to look at whether "Fiorina's plan would mean slashing Social Security and Medicare, which would devastate seniors." To support the claim, the Boxer campaign points to several of Fiorina's public statements in which she said entitlement reform was necessary to rein in government spending. (Technically speaking, entitlements are any kind of government benefit program, but people usually mean Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.) As we reviewed Fiorina's position on entitlements, we couldn't help but notice one thing: Fiorina isn't terribly specific about what she thinks entitlement reform should include. She does say often that she does not want to cut benefits for current retirees or those nearing retirement. We should note here that most of the candidates from both parties say that entitlement reform is necessary, and pretty much all say we shouldn't cut benefits for current retirees or those nearing retirement. You might call these generic talking points. Perhaps the best discussion of Fiorina's specific views on entitlements came in an interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News on Oct. 17, 2010. Wallace asked her several times about how to cut Medicare or Social Security, with Fiorina dodging the questions. The last exchange went like this: Wallace: "I'm going to try one last time, and if you don't want to answer it, Ms. Fiorina, you don't have to." Fiorina: "It's not a question of not wanting to answer it." Wallace: "Then let me ask the question, if I may, please. You're not willing to put forward a single benefit -- I'm not even talking about the people that are 60, let alone 65 or 70. I'm talking about people under 55. You're not willing to say there's a single benefit eligibility for Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security that you're willing to say, yeah, I would cut that?" Fiorina: "What I think we need to do to engage the American people in a conversation about entitlement reform is to have a bipartisan group of people to come together and put every solution on the table, every alternative on the table. And then we ought to engage in a long conversation with the American people so they understand the choices, instead of rushing off into a closed room and having 100 senators figure it out for themselves. We need to engage the American people in the conversation and I'm willing to consider any alternative. But we cannot continue to just jump over the fact that our government is bloated, wasteful, inefficient, in many cases inept, and frankly, in many cases as well, corrupt." We would say that Fiorina doesn't really have a position on cutting entitlements, but the Boxer campaign pointed us to a few comments Fiorina has made praising plans promoted by the conservative think tanks The Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute. The Boxer campaign also points out that Fiorina says she wants to cap federal spending at 20 percent of the gross domestic product -- which Boxer's people said necessarily means "slashing Medicare and Social Security." Because Social Security and Medicare are such large parts of the federal budget, they say, it's impossible to achieve spending cuts of that magnitude without cutting the programs, which make up a significant part of the federal budget. Fiorina has said that entitlements need to be dealt with in a comprehensive manner. "I'm prepared to look at any and all ideas without stating at this point which I would favor and which I would not. We have to have a comprehensive look at entitlement reform, including Social Security reform," she told the Los Angeles Times. We certainly don't like it when candidates refuse to give specifics about their plans. Fiorina has indicated she would accept some form of cuts to Social Security and Medicare for younger workers, but time and again she has refused to be specific, and only speaks about curtailing future spending for the programs in vague generalities. Still, that does not give the Boxer campaign the right to fill in the blanks. We do know that Fiorina supports slowing the growth of such programs to rein in government spending, but we don't know what specific proposals would look like, and whether they would constitute "slashing." And for this reason, we rate Boxer's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Barbara Boxer	None	None	None	2010-10-22T16:39:20	2010-10-15	['Carly_Fiorina', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']
pomt-15094	Says Marco Rubio has "the worst voting record there is today."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/17/donald-trump/trump-says-marco-rubio-has-worst-voting-record-the/	In one of many heated exchanges during the second Republican primary debate, Donald Trump mocked Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s poor attendance record in the Senate after Rubio schooled Trump on his lack foreign policy knowledge. "The one thing that the federal government must do -- the one thing that only the federal government can do -- is keep us safe," Rubio said on Sept. 16. "And a president better be up-to-date on those issues on his first day in office, on her first day in office." "You have to understand, I am not sitting in the United States Senate with, by the way, the worst voting record there is today," Trump countered, referring to Rubio’s missed votes. "No. 1, I am not sitting in the United States Senate. I am a businessman doing business transactions." Rubio admitted that he didn’t have the best attendance record and suggested that’s because he’s focusing on something more important: the White House. We wondered if Rubio really has missed the most Senate votes in the GOP field. Neither the Rubio nor Trump campaigns got back to us. But we took a look at the roll calls and found that the "most truant" award goes to Rubio if we’re looking at this year only. If we examine career records, Republican rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas takes the crown. Votes missed this year From the start of the year to Sept. 9, Rubio had missed 77 of 263 roll call votes, USA Today reported, though he was present for the two additional votes that have taken place since that tally. Based USA Today’s and our own calculations, here’s how Rubio stacks up against the other senator-candidates right now: Senator Votes missed (Jan. 1 to Sept. 16) Absentee rate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 77 29.1 percent Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 62 23.4 percent Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) 60 22.6 percent Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 9 3.4 percent Rand Paul (R-Ky.) 4 1.5 percent Republican rival Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are close to Rubio’s truancy rate. In contrast, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who’s running for the Senate and the presidency, has the best attendance record. (The senators who are running for president tend to have the lowest vote participation rates.) The majority of the votes Rubio’s skipped came after April 13, when he announced his candidacy, the Tampa Bay Times noted. "It's not unusual for presidential candidates to miss Senate votes," Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon told the Tampa Bay Times. "Sen. Rubio remains fully engaged in the issues important to Florida and helping Floridians, and as he travels the country to talk about his agenda to help the middle class, there will be no doubt where he stands on any important issues before the Senate." Overall attendance If we look at career truancy, Cruz has a worse attendance record than Rubio, but it’s pretty close. Here’s how the presidential field compares, according to data from GovTrack. Senator Votes missed (career) Absentee rate Cruz 104 out of 922 11.3 percent Rubio 154 out of 1,408 10.9 percent Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y., 2001-2009) 249 out of 2,616 9.5 percent Graham 221 out of 4,081 5.4 percent Paul 43 out of 1,408 3.1 percent Sanders 83 out of 2,761 3.0 percent Jim Webb (D-Va., 2007-2012) 37 out of 1,839 2.0 percent Rick Santorum (R-Penn., 1995-2006 ) 79 out of 4,156 1.9 percent So Cruz has skipped out on more votes over his career than any other senator or former senator in the 2016 race. But beyond the field, neither Cruz or Rubio are the worst ever offenders -- in fact, they didn’t even crack the top 100, according to a May 2015 Washington Post analysis. President Barack Obama missed 24.2 percent of votes in his brief senate career. And that doesn’t even compare to the most truant senator of all time: Maryon Allen, D-Ala., who racked up a 43.5 percent absentee rate during her five-month stint in the Senate in 1978. Our ruling Trump said that Rubio has "the worst voting record there is today." He’s accurate if we look at the number of votes missed this year out of the five current senators running for president. Rubio has missed about a third of all votes. If we look at career truancy records, Rubio is a close second to Ted Cruz among the current field. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-13894	"Doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/29/david-clarke-jr/do-250000-americans-die-every-year-because-mistake/	Speaking to an anti-government group in New York, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. vowed to "do everything that I can" to get Donald Trump elected president. The pledge made news back home. But a claim Clarke made about doctors killing people is what caught our attention. The conservative firebrand, who has built a national profile with frequent appearances on the Fox News Channel, spoke June 13, 2016 in Albany to the New York Oath Keepers. The group, sometimes dubbed a citizens militia, says its aim is to educate people "on the true purpose of the Constitution, which is to preserve liberty for the people." It gave Clarke its annual leadership award. The 38-year law enforcement veteran spent much of his speech defending police agencies from criticism by outsiders. "I decided at one point that I'd had enough. I was not going to let somebody who had never done this job for one day in their life transform this profession," Clarke said. "That would be akin to me trying to transform the medical community after a botched surgery when I know nothing about the medical community. I'm not educated in it, I'm not trained in it. By the way, did you know that doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries? "Has anybody-- has President Obama or the attorney general or Black Lives Matter -- demanded that the medical community be transformed? No. The medical community will have to figure that out." There was a 250,000 figure in the news recently. But Clarke misstates it. Recent study Clarke refused to provide us information to back up his claim, saying through a spokeswoman that he "gets his data from the same sources that the anti-gun bigots get their data from." But it seems likely his statement was based on news reports about a study on medical errors that was published several weeks earlier in The BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal. It is an international peer-reviewed medical journal. The study, which was done by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, made news in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and in news outlets across the nation. Its major finding: An estimated 251,454 deaths per year, or 9.5 percent of all deaths in the United States, stem from a medical error. In publishing the study, The BMJ declared that medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the United States, behind heart disease and cancer. Those diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each cause about 600,000 deaths per year. Regarding Clarke's claim, there are two important things to note: 1. The study did not attempt to do a count of deaths attributed to medical errors -- rather it made estimates based on medical death rate data and hospitalizations. 2. More importantly, the 250,000 estimate was based on many types of medical errors, not just botched surgeries -- anything from bad doctors to communication breakdowns when patients are handed off from one department to another, to medicine dosage mistakes, diagnostic errors and more. "It boils down to people dying from the care that they receive rather than the disease for which they are seeking care," Johns Hopkins professor of surgery Martin Makary, the study’s lead author, told the Washington Post. Digging deeper Critics pointed out that the study did not take into account studies from 2008 and later, when improvements have been made, Modern Healthcare reported. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in December 2015 that from 2010 to 2014, hospital patients experienced 2.1 million fewer hospital-acquired conditions, resulting in about 87,000 fewer patients dying in hospitals. On other hand, we found that some studies have published estimates that were higher than the one from Johns Hopkins. A study published in 2013 in the Journal of Patient Safety estimated that more than 400,000 patients per year die in hospitals as a result of "preventable harm." And a 2014 report for the U.S. Senate estimated medical errors killed 325,000 people per year. Like the Johns Hopkins study, neither of those studies made an estimate of the number of deaths due specifically to errors in surgery. And Makary, the lead author of the Johns Hopkins study, told us he is not aware of any studies that count surgery deaths. Our rating Clarke said: "Doctors kill about 250,000 people a year in botched surgeries." A study released several weeks before Clarke made the statement estimates that 251,000 people per year in the United States die from any number of types of medical errors. But that figure is an estimate. Moreover, no estimate was made in the study on the number of deaths due to botched surgeries. We rate Clarke’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/720b6f29-2935-4a40-adbd-b43c972c33dc	None	David A. Clarke Jr.	None	None	None	2016-06-29T05:00:00	2016-06-13	['None']
pomt-07830	"In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/15/milele-coggs/milwaukee-ald-milele-coggs-says-bill-would-give-wi/	Republicans in Madison waited a decade for their chance to get a photo ID requirement in place for Wisconsin elections. Now in power, they have crafted a bill that critics say is so tight it will limit voter access. Opponents include some members of the Milwaukee Common Council. Ald. Milele Coggs issued a news release Feb. 3, 2011 criticizing the measure as toughest in the country. "In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation," Coggs said in a release commemorating passage of the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed voting rights regardless of race. "It will disproportionately impact people of color, students and the elderly." The arguments surrounding photo IDs are fierce, including claims about how much such a requirement would reduce voting. We’re not ruling on those projections here -- or GOP arguments that the bill is needed to curb fraud. We are simply testing Coggs’ contention that the bills is the toughest. Asked about her claim, Coggs pointed to data assembled by the National Conference of State Legislatures on the eight states that currently ask voters for photo ID: Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan and South Dakota. Another 18 states require an ID, but not necessarily a photo. Oklahoma will make 19 as of July 2011. For now, Wisconsin is among the remaining that require no ID. Coggs says the heart of the issue is which IDs are deemed acceptable. We think that makes sense, because the pending legislation is all about proof of identity. As a secondary test, we will touch on how states treat voters who forget to bring an ID to the polls. As things currently stand in the bill, Wisconsin would accept three sorts of identification: military ID, a driver’s license or a state-issued ID. That’s a much shorter list than in other photo ID states, based on our interviews with state elections officials and the study by the state legislatures group. In contrast, Florida takes 12 different forms, including employee badges, buyer’s club cards, retirement center IDs, entertainment cards and public assistance IDs. Hawaii is open-ended, requiring a signed picture ID but not limiting what is accepted. A key point in the debate over the measure is whether Wisconsin should accept student IDs. Many students lack Wisconsin driver’s licenses and critics question whether they will be motivated enough to go to a state office to get a state ID before voting. All the other photo ID states accept student IDs -- at least from public institutions of higher education. Michigan even takes a high school ID. Republicans in Wisconsin so far have resisted calls to allow student IDs, saying there is too much potential for fraud and administrative headaches. Passports are another difference. The Wisconsin bill would not allow them. All the other photo ID states accept them. Additionally, tribal IDs are allowed in several states but not in the Wisconsin proposal. What do others think? David Canon, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who has studied election administration nationally, said Coggs’ claim was right on target. Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin’s elections chief, also said the bill as proposed was the most restrictive in the country. And Michael Pyritz, considered a leading GOP staff expert on voter ID, agreed that Wisconsin’s proposed ID list is narrower than other states. At least it stands right now. Pyritz, an aide to Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale), predicted that GOP lawmakers will move to expand the list of IDs -- something Democratic critics and state elections officials have called for. Lawmaker almost certainly will allow the use of passports, Pyritz said. Similarly, he said, tribal IDs will "most likely" will be added in. Student IDs are under discussion, but Pyritz said the current conventional wisdom was that would not be added to the bill. The Wisconsin bill is comparable to -- though still more restrictive than -- a proposal moving swiftly through the Texas Legislature. That plan would allow five forms of ID -- including concealed handgun licenses, passports and state-issued IDs. That covers the IDs themselves. What about those who forget them on election day? The Wisconsin bill is as restrictive -- if not more so -- than the other photo ID states. The bill would allow a voter to cast a provisional ballot that will count if they show up at their clerk’s office within 24 hours of the election with proper ID. Georgia uses provisional balloting but gives the forgetful voters until the Friday after election day. Indiana allows 10 days. Some states, such as Michigan, allow voters to simply sign an affidavit and vote like any other voter. Pyritz said lawmakers are considering a change in the bill to give voters more time to make their provisional ballot count. This item is clear. As introduced, the Republican photo ID bill takes a tougher line than the other photo ID states. The number and type of IDs allowed is narrower and the deadlines for alternative voting procedure are tighter.

He's wrong on both counts. Gas prices have soared this year, and so have the profits of Exxon Mobil and other companies. But in saying they've "never been higher," Obama overstates the case. The price for a gallon of gas peaked in March 1981 at $1.42 a gallon, said Jonathan Cogan, a senior analyst for the Energy Information Administration. Sounds cheap, but factor in inflation and that's a whopping $3.38 per gallon. Two days before Obama gave his speech, the Energy Information Administration put the price of gas at $2.98 per gallon — 40 cents less than the inflation-adjusted 1981 price. Even without inflation, Obama had it wrong. In May 2007, prices hit $3.218 per gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration, which has tracked the average weekly price of gasoline for decades. PolitiFact will grant that gas prices are uncomfortably high for many of us. Does that mean Exxon Mobil is raking in more dough than ever? Not at the moment. The company did earn record annual profits of $39.5-billion in 2006. Their record-breaking streak continued through the first quarter of 2007, according to the company's quarterly statements. But the company's second quarter sales fell billions short of Wall Street expectations. Profits declined in the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2007, profit fell 1 percent from the same period in 2006. The Irving, Texas, company still posted healthy profits of nearly $29-billion, but Obama was wrong. Exxon Mobil's profits have been higher. Too bad Obama didn't give his speech in January 2007. It would have been half true. But this week, he's just plain wrong. UPDATE: On Feb. 1, 2008, Exxon Mobil announced a $40.6-billion net profit -- a record. But Obama made his statement more than a month earlier and, as we explain above, the company had not released record profits at that time -- nor were gas prices at record highs. So we're going to keep our False ruling, but we will acknowledge that Obama was prescient, at least as it relates to Exxon Mobil's financial performance.

pomt-04888	Medicare insurance premiums will be rising to "$120.20 per month in 2013 and $247.00 per month in 2014."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/07/chain-email/blue-cross-logo-gives-new-fuel-bogus-e-mail-claimi/	If you're a Medicare recipient, are you facing a massive increase in your monthly premium if you pay for Part B coverage? That’s what a chain e-mail that’s making the rounds says. We received a copy and we heard a caller cite it recently on WPRO’s "The Buddy Cianci Show," so we decided to check it out. The e-mail claims the increase was "purposely delayed so as not to confuse the 2012 Re-Election Campaigns." It says the $104.20 monthly fee for 2012 will be "$120.20 per month in 2013 and $247.00 per month in 2014." That's more than double in one year. Some other versions blame Obamacare for the sharp increase. "You probably haven't heard about it in the Mainstream News," the e-mail says. Well, there's a reason for that. The claim is as bogus as a $3 bill. Fact-checkers everywhere have debunked it, including PolitiFact National and our friends at FactCheck.org and Snopes.com. But the version that's making the rounds has a new twist: it comes from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama. More about that in a moment. First, we should update some numbers. The e-mail says the "current" monthly fee is $96.40. That was actually the premium in 2009. It gives a 2012 rate as $104.20; it's actually $99.90. The premium for 2013 will be set in the fall. But according to Page 229 of the 2012 report from the board of trustees on Medicare, the estimated standard monthly premium will be about $109.10 a month, not $120.20. In 2014 it will be about $3 more, not $127 more as the e-mail claims. After that, the report projects, annual increases through 2021 will likely range from 4.3 to 6.1 percent. It should be noted that higher-income seniors are charged more, a provision that was in place years before Obamacare was passed. Now back to Blue Cross. We suspect that the e-mail is getting additional credence because it carries the logo of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama and contact information for a worker there. When we called Alabama, Koko Mackin, a Blue Cross vice president, said the worker had simply received the e-mail and forwarded it without assessing whether it was true. "This e-mail was not created or approved for distribution by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama and is not reflective of the Company's position. It contains incorrect information received by an employee who redistributed it to six others," she said in a statement. Our ruling A chain e-mail says Medicare insurance premiums will be rising to "$120.20 per month in 2013 and $247.00 per month in 2014." The claim has been repeatedly debunked and although the truth can easily be found with a quick Google search, it continues to spread. Even newer estimates from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services show that the increases projected through 2021 will bring the premium to $161.20 -- not even close to the $247 premium that the e-mail says will take effect in 2014. So if you're feeling hot and bothered after reading and passing along this bit of e-mail twaddle, it's not because seniors will be facing a 105 percent premium increase from 2013 to 2014. It's because you've got Pants on Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-05007	"Eighty out of 82 counties in Ohio ... have an auto manufacturing facility."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/18/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-80-ohio-counties-hav/	Upcoming elections amid a tepid economic recovery have turned monthly employment reports from the U.S. Department of Labor into a regular theme for campaign rhetoric. June 2012 employment numbers released on July 6 showed a gain of 80,000 jobs and an 8.2 percent national unemployment rate unchanged from the previous month. Each side put their own political spin on the news. "Fox News Sunday" host John Roberts hashed over the subject two days later with the chairs of the Republican and Democratic national committees. DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from Florida, accentuated its positive aspects while repeatedly alluding to likely GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s 2008 advice that the auto industry in Detroit should be permitted to go bankrupt. "In Ohio," Wasserman Schultz noted, "80 out of 82 counties in Ohio actually have an auto manufacturing facility. So, if it was left to Mitt Romney, they essentially would have all gone out of business because he would have left those folks twisting in the wind." It’s widely recognized that the auto industry is a main driver of Ohio’s economy. But PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Wasserman Schultz’s statistics. To begin with, Ohio has 88 counties, not 82. The Democratic National Committee’s press office did not respond to PolitiFact Ohio’s request for background on her comments, although her claim that 80 of the state’s counties contain auto manufacturing facilities is echoed in a March 2012 report from Obama’s re-election campaign (which got the number of Ohio’s counties right). "Auto jobs are spread across the state," the Obama campaign statement says: "80 out of 88 counties have at least one auto industry establishment." The Obama campaign document cites a statistic from a February 2011 Ohio Department of Development report, which says motor vehicles are produced in 80 of Ohio’s counties. "The production of motor vehicles, bodies, trailers and parts is diffused across the state - 80 counties have at least one industry establishment," that report says. "One half the jobs were located in 10 counties: Cuyahoga, Hancock, Logan, Lorain, Lucas, Montgomery, Richland, Shelby, Trumbull and Union counties." But a June 2012 snapshot of Ohio’s motor vehicle industry produced by the same agency estimates that at least 12 of Ohio’s 88 counties have no motor vehicle industry employees: Adams, Athens, Coshocton, Guernsey, Harrison, Hocking, Jackson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe, Muskingum and Vinton counties. That would put motor vehicle industry workers in 76 of Ohio’s 88 counties. Ohio Department of Development spokeswoman Stephanie Mennecke told PolitiFact Ohio that the newer document used a more limited definition of the motor vehicle industry than the older report and that could help explain the change. For example, she said the newer report categorizes jobs produced by a Daimler diesel engine remanufacturing plant in Guernsey County are under a code for machinery workers, not motor vehicle industry workers. It excluded categories like tire manufacturing, tire retreading, and the manufacture of storage batteries that the previous report included in its "motor vehicle industry" classification. Mennecke said that different organizations use different definitions for "auto industry" when they produce their statistics, so it can be hard to compare numbers produced by different groups. Wasserman Schultz’s claim referred specifically to auto manufacturing. The 80 county statistic from the Ohio Department of Development’s 2011 report referred to "motor vehicle industry" workers. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics lumps all other motor vehicle makers into the automobile category when it tabulates its auto industry employment statistics. Even the Ohio Department of Development varies its definition of "motor vehicle industry" in the different reports it produces. Wasserman Schultz’s claim -- 80 of 82 counties in Ohio have an auto manufacturing facility -- is generally accurate. While she misstated the total number of counties in the state, she got right the number of counties that have at least one business related to production of motor vehicles, bodies, trailers and parts. A report from the Ohio Department of Development backs that figure. A more current report from the Department of Development sets that figure at 76 of Ohio’s 88 counties. But an expert told PolitiFact Ohio that changes in how the industry group is defined could be part of the reason for that change. That’s additional information that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim rates Mostly True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2012-07-18T06:00:00	2012-07-08	['Ohio']
pomt-01259	Every new Republican member of the U.S. Senate said they "will vote to repeal and replace Obamacare."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/10/sean-hannity/hannity-every-new-gop-senator-wants-repealreplace-/	Now that the Republicans have won control in the Senate, one of the biggest questions is what they will do on health care. Fox News host Sean Hannity hammered home one strategy in his post-election analysis Nov. 5. Talking to Republican Louisiana U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy, who is in a runoff with incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, Hannity said, "Every single candidate like yourself running for office said you will vote to repeal and replace Obamacare." Later, in an interview with Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, Hannity said, "Every candidate that won in the Senate promised to repeal and replace Obamacare," Hannity said. And he made the same point with Cory Gardner, who defeated incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado. "Every Republican that won elections last night, including yourself, you said repeal/replace Obamacare." All within the span of an hour. Here we're focusing on the 10 new Republicans joining the Senate. (The outcomes of races in Alaska and Louisiana are still pending.) By and large, Hannity has a point. The list David Perdue - Georgia: Posted on his campaign website, "We need to repeal Obamacare and replace it with more affordable free market solutions." Joni Ernst - Iowa: Posted on her campaign website, "Joni is staunchly opposed to the Obamacare law. Joni supports immediate action to repeal Obamacare and replace it with common sense, free-market alternatives." Thom Tillis - North Carolina: Posted on his campaign website, "As North Carolina’s U.S. senator, Tillis will push for repeal of Obamacare, a balanced budget, and conservative economic policy." In the most literal sense, Tillis fails to say he would replace the Affordable Care Act. The closest he comes is a vague promise "to work to implement private sector solutions to reduce health care costs for North Carolinians." Ben Sasse - Nebraska: In listing his agenda on his campaign website, Sasse included "repeal Obamacare." Sasse would replace it with a plan that creates a new tax deduction for individually-purchased insurance, allows people to buy insurance across state lines, makes health savings accounts more financially attractive, and reduces federal controls on state Medicaid programs. Notably, on Medicare, Sasse would raise the eligibility age and reduce benefits for the wealthy. Mike Rounds - South Dakota: Posted on his campaign website, "Mike opposes Obamacare and would work to repeal and replace it with market-based, patient-centered solutions." Tom Cotton - Arkansas: PolitiFact explored Cotton’s opposition to Obamacare and found several statements like this one on his congressional website, "I will fight to repeal and replace Obamacare with free-market reforms that empower patients and doctors to make health-care decisions. … Obamacare must be repealed entirely." James Lankford - Oklahoma: Posted to his Senate campaign website "More than 55 times in the past three years I have voted to repeal, replace or delay the Obamacare law." Further down on that page, Lankford wrote, "I am a co-sponsor of the conservative replacement for Obamacare HR 3590. I am also the author of the only alternative that completely returns the oversight of health care back to the states." Cory Gardner - Colorado: Posted a petition to repeal Obamacare on his campaign website. The section on that site that summarized Gardner’s record said, "He supports legislation that repeals this misguided law and replaces it with a solution that allows the purchase of insurance across state lines, bolsters state high-risk pools to provide for those with pre-existing conditions, and enacts badly needed tort reform to reduce medical costs, among other ideas." Shelley Moore Capito - West Virginia: During an October debate, Capito said, "What I would vote for is to repeal and replace. I voted for that 50 times but I also recognize that the ACA has some very good things about it." Capito went on to say she supported the ban on denying insurance for pre-existing conditions and giving parents the chance to keep kids on their plans until they turn 26. Steve Daines - Montana: When Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced her resignation, Daines said, "While Secretary Sebelius’ resignation is a good start, it’s not enough — we need to repeal Obamacare before further harm comes to Montana families, and replace it with Montana-driven reforms that put the patient and their doctor — not government bureaucrats — in charge of health care decisions." But during an October debate, when Daines was asked about repealing Obamacare, he gave a slightly nuanced response, "I did not vote against Obamacare 40 times. Should check my record. I voted against it once, to repeal Obamacare. That’s my voting record." During a June debate, Daines said he supports the law’s ban on denying insurance for pre-existing conditions and giving parents the chance to keep kids on their plans until they turn 26. Our ruling Hannity said that the new Republican senators campaigned on a platform to repeal and replace Obamacare. All 10 new Republican senators said during their campaigns either that Obamacare should be repealed or that they had voted to repeal it. The record on replacement is a little more nuanced. Republicans generally either explicitly say they want to replace Obamacare or more generally talk about health policy changes they support or parts of the Affordable Care Act that they’d like to keep. Bottom line, Hannity is clearly right on the trend line. We rate his claim Mostly True. UPDATE: After our fact-check published, Sasse's office pointed out additional details Sasse offered in his plan to replace Obamacare. Those comments are now included in this article. The rating remains Mostly True.	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2014-11-10T16:00:00	2014-11-05	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act', 'United_States']
pomt-11529	Says that as a judge, she has "presided over more than 10,000 cases."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/16/rebecca-dallet/supreme-court-candidate-rebecca-dallets-claim-she-/	Rebecca Dallet argues she is the most experienced candidate running in the Feb. 20, 2018, primary for Wisconsin Supreme Court. The liberal-leaning Milwaukee County circuit judge faces Madison attorney Tim Burns, a declared Democrat, and conservative Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock. The two with the most votes will square off April 3 to replace conservative Justice Michael Gableman, who is not seeking re-election. Dallet, in answering questions from the Wisconsin Justice Initiative about her qualifications, said that as a judge she has "presided over more than 10,000 cases." Her response, published online Jan. 19, 2018, essentially repeats a claim she has made a number of times, including in news releases and in interviews. "Presided over" suggests significant involvement in a case and 10,000 is a big number. Let’s take a look. Dallet’s caseload Dallet was elected judge in 2008. As one of 47 Milwaukee County judges, she currently serves in the civil division, which handles cases such as lawsuits, small claims and restraining orders. She previously was assigned homicide, felony drug, felony sexual assault and felony gun cases; general misdemeanor and domestic violence cases, and other matters. We contacted the Milwaukee County circuit clerk’s office, which provided a spreadsheet of cases in which Dallet is listed as the "responsible court official." The spreadsheet shows 11,808 cases assigned to Dallet. The major categories break down this way: Type of case Number of cases Percentage of cases Traffic 2,939 24.9% Misdemeanor 2,591 21.9% Civil 2,576 21.8% Felony 2,292 19.4% But there are some points worth noting. Amy Wochos, a senior administrator with the court clerk’s office, told us the list probably both overcounts and undercounts Dallet’s cases. For example, the list does not include cases where Dallet conducted some hearings, but then the case was transferred to another judge to conduct the remaining hearings. And the list includes cases in which another judge conducted all the hearings in a case, but then the case was technically transferred to Dallet before it was officially closed in the court system. An example of the latter: In the first case on Dallet’s list, a West Allis man was charged in 2008 with drug possession. The court record shows he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. The man’s initial court appearance and some other matters were handled by Circuit Court commissioners; an indigency hearing and a status conference were held by one Circuit Court judge and the sentencing was handled by another judge. For all practical purposes, the case was complete, but it was transferred to Dallet prior to a formal judgment of conviction being entered into the record. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved through a plea bargain, not by a trial. But trials can lead to lengthy proceedings. An example: In December 2008, a Milwaukee man was charged with second offense possession of marijuana, a felony, and misdemeanor bail jumping. Court commissioners handled the initial steps, including a hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence to put the man on trial. Starting in January 2009, Dallet handled the case the rest of the way, for a total of about six months. In-court proceedings included a motion hearing, a scheduling conference, a pretrial conference and several other hearings leading up to a two-day jury trial. The man was found guilty and was sentenced by Dallet on March 30, 2009. The case came before Dallet again three months later, when she had to rule on a request from the man regarding his sentencing. Before we wrap up, one more example: The first civil case on Dallet’s list was a foreclosure filed in March 2010. It remained on the court docket for more than seven years, until November 2017, though it was before Dallet only briefly. The case was transferred to her in March 2016 and she later issued two orders in the case. In sum, some cases handled by a judge can involve numerous actions and proceedings over a period of months, while others require less activity. And it’s important to note that in-court proceedings don’t take into account any research or other preparation a judge has to do outside of court. Like criminal cases, Dallet may have spent relatively little time on some civil cases and much more time on others. Our rating Dallet says that as a judge, she has "presided over more than 10,000 cases." The best-available count shows Dallet has handled some 11,800 cases, including criminal and civil matters. For a statement that is accurate, without any significant information missing, our rating is True. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.comOther fact checks in the race Screnock says Tim Burns and Rebecca Dallet "have openly criticized laws signed by Governor Walker that they disagree with and are campaigning as activists who will implement their policies from the bench."

pomt-13902	The United States "is the only major country that taxes its own exports."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/jun/28/kevin-brady/texas-republican-kevin-brady-errs-comparison-us-ta/	House Republicans announced last Thursday legislation that they say would simplify the tax code, lower taxes, boost job creation and improve international competitiveness. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, co-hosted the press conference — part of the GOP’s "Better Way" initiative — along with Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. During the announcement, Brady compared the United States tax code to other countries’ and made one notable claim about United States exporters. "No longer will we be the only major country that taxes its own exports," Brady said. He wrote something similar in a Wall Street Journal editorial. This caught our eye, given a clause in the Constitution — Article I, Section 9 — stating "No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State." So what was Brady referring to? A spokesperson for Brady referred us to the GOP’s "Our Better Way" tax plan. So we dug in. ‘Our Better Way’ The plan points to one aspect of the current tax code: the use of a federal corporate income tax rather than a federal consumption tax. Let’s explain. Many countries beside the United States use a "value-added" consumption tax in addition to an income tax. The VAT is complicated to explain, but in essence applies taxes throughout the production chain and not just at the end like a normal sales tax. One aspect of the VAT is "border adjustability," which means the country removes the "value-added" tax when it’s applied to exports, said Richard Schmalbeck, a professor of law at Duke University. "VATs are consumption taxes, and it wouldn't be appropriate for the French to tax consumption by residents of other countries," Schmalbeck said. "The border adjustments assure that the tax will be borne only by French consumers." Point being, other countries’ national consumption taxes (which the United States does not have) do not tax exports. But Brady is missing something in his comparison. Income taxes Other countries’ income taxes do capture exports under their umbrella, experts told us. Some of the income from exported goods is still made from domestic manufacturing, said H. David Rosenbloom, a professor of taxation at New York University, who called Brady’s claim "incomplete." "When BMW manufactures an automobile in Germany, I would doubt very much that the income attributable to the manufacturing activity is exempt from German income taxation," Rosenbloom said. Exempting foreign export sales from income tax is also not an easy task, said Peter Barnes, a senior lecturing fellow at Duke University. Companies would have to keep separate books on domestic and foreign sales. He added that some countries in the past, China and India notably, have done this. However, such exemptions are not standard practice, Barnes said. Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, agreed. He said other countries’ income taxes would impose some burden on exports, even if exports are exempted from their consumption taxes. "The ‘territorial’ corporate income taxes that most countries have are still origin-based taxes (i.e., not border adjusted)," Rosenberg said. "The base is essentially domestic production and those taxes apply to domestically produced goods whether they are sold at home or abroad." A new system Among other measures designed to promote international competitiveness, the GOP plan wants to transform the United States’ current corporate income tax system, which currently lacks border adjustments, into what is called a "destination, cash-flow based" income tax. This new system would tax net cash flow, deduct exported sales and impose the income tax on imports. Thus, the new tax protocol provides for income taxes on the "border adjustments" other countries use for VAT consumption taxes. To deduct exports, companies would subtract sales abroad from revenue otherwise taxed, Rosenberg said. However, Rosenberg and other economists are also not sold on how problematic the current state of affairs actually is. "Most economists would not expect any significant change in the terms of trade from this tax swap," he said. Barnes also suggested that the new tax system could compel other countries to move to a destination-based system, hurting U.S. businesses. "Imagine if Boeing owed income tax to every country where it sold a plane," Barnes said. "Or Apple." It is also unclear that border adjustments under the new approach would be allowed by current international tax law, Rosenberg said. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, also wrote the World Trade Organization might not approve this new plan. A few exceptions Even if you believe Brady broadly has something of a point comparing the U.S. system to VAT countries, he’s wrong on the specifics. Other countries do apply a direct export tax on goods. Most of these are in developing countries and are imposed only on select agricultural goods, according to a WTO report. But a few countries that impose export taxes are countries belonging to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (a typical benchmark for a major country). Norway, Turkey and Mexico have export taxes for a few select goods. Brazil has an export tax on all goods, up to 30 percent, although officials say these taxes are typically not applied. Our ruling Brady said that the United States is the only country that taxes its own exports, a problem the GOP tax plan intends to fix. Other countries do exempt exports from their consumption taxes using "border-adjustments." However, experts told us that Brady’s statement ignores the income taxes of other countries, which do end up taxing export income, at least in part. For that reason, we rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/232eaee9-6d5f-4e86-863e-162ba667e2af	None	Kevin Brady	None	None	None	2016-06-28T11:30:41	2016-06-24	['United_States']
pomt-04511	"While Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/04/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-ad-claims-josh-mandel-raised-campaig/	Although he didn’t formally announce his candidacy until early this year, within months of taking office as Ohio treasurer in 2011, it was apparent that Republican Josh Mandel was running for the U.S. Senate. An ad from the campaign of his opponent, incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, targets his performance in Columbus, making this claim: "While Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work." That made him sound like a no-show employee, which drew the interest of PolitiFact Ohio. We asked the Brown campaign to back up the claim. It cited an Associated Press story from Jan. 26, 2012, that reported Mandel was in Washington that day "to attend a $500-a-plate breakfast fundraiser for his U.S. Senate campaign, continuing his trend of skipping meetings of a board he chairs that handles billions of Ohio's deposits." That is the State Board of Deposit, which decides which banks get custody of the state's money. Chaired by the treasurer, the panel also includes the auditor and attorney general. It meets monthly. The board's minutes show Mandel missed 14 consecutive meetings after taking office before attending his first one on March 19. He was quoted at the time as saying that it was the first meeting in two years involving a major decision about state deposits. Mandel's office noted he is permitted by statute to send a representative in his place when he misses the meetings. Board records show that he sent his chief financial officer and general counsel, Seth Metcalf. Both Auditor Dave Yost and Attorney General Mike DeWine also have sent surrogates, the records show. Like Mandel, the meeting March 19 was the first either of them attended personally. Though sending a designee to meetings is not uncommon, the Associated Press found Mandel "unique among modern-era treasurers" by attending none in his first year. An AP report from Jan. 25, 2012, said that "Democrat Kevin Boyce and Republican Jennette Bradley both attended the board’s monthly meetings less than half the time. Democrat Richard Cordray almost always went. Earlier treasurers Ken Blackwell, Joe Deters and Mary Ellen Withrow all attended at least occasionally." The online magazine Salon published a story on Oct. 3, 2012 -- after the Brown ad was broadcast -- noting that the state treasurer also serves on an additional seven boards or commissions. Mandel sent representatives but did not attend any of their meetings until last March, Salon said, citing information it was provided by the liberal research group American Bridge through open records requests. Mandel's spokesman Seth Unger, who called the report a "red herring," said the treasurer "has appointed designees to represent him on these boards, commissions and authorities, as has been customary under prior administrations both Democrat and Republican alike. "Our designees have also confirmed that the other statewide officers currently on these boards send designees to represent their offices," he said. "It should be noted that while these bodies remain in statute, some meet only very sporadically, and one has not convened for years." The Brown campaign also provided a list of 225 out-of-office events which could be viewed as political, from late March 2011 to early July 2012 -- 44 of them out-of-state, with all but three of those on workdays, and including at least 64 fundraisers. Democrats have pointed to Mandel's calendar before, as an article in The Plain Dealer reported last January, to argue he was barely working or that he was not being forthcoming in how he spends his time. While the events show Mandel's political involvement, however, they do not provide evidence that he failed to perform his duties of office, as spelled out in Chapter 113 of the Ohio Revised Code. The treasurer of state is an elected administrator. He does not have specified hours or attendance requirements. It’s not like his office shuts down when he is not there. The treasurer has a staff that handles the daily operations of the office. When the Ohio Democratic Party made a public records request for Mandel's official schedule, the treasurer's officer delivered with it a copy of Mandel's "2011 Top-Bottom Review," listing what he considered his office's top accomplishments. The treasurer's Annual Report for fiscal 2012 listed more of what his office called steps "to cut waste, reduce spending and increase efficiency." The week of Sept. 28, 2012, the office touted the launch of a searchable online database of Ohio's state-owned properties and buildings. What does all this say about the claim in Brown's TV ad, that "while Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work"? The claim in the Brown ad is partially accurate. His campaign cited meetings of the Board of Deposit, on which Mandel sits, including at least one case where Mandel was fundraising in Washington on the day of a meeting. It also cited at least 44 out-of-state political events from March 2011 to July 2012 from Mandel’s schedule -- slightly less than three per month -- and more than 200 out-of-office events, of which at least 64 were fundraisers. But the ad leaves out important details needed to put the claim in context. Members of the Board of Deposit are permitted to send a representative in their place. Mandel has done that, as did both the auditor and attorney general, who also are on the board. In assessing a claim about the state investment pool’s credit rating, PolitiFact Ohio talked to a financial expert from Standard & Poors who noted that Mandel deserved credit for his performance as state treasurer, an administrative post whose responsibilities by law are to safeguard and invest the state’s money. During the time he has been state treasurer, the state’s credit rating for it’s STAR Ohio investment fund has remained at the top level. It is not uncommon for politicians to run for higher office while holding an elected seat, and the that can have an impact on the amount of time they are in their current jobs. But the implication of the claim in the Brown campaign ad is that Mandel has neglected his duties as state treasurer while he campaigns for Senate. While there is support for the claim that he has been out of the office, we don’t see evidence that the office is not functioning properly. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.

pomt-08826	Cap and trade legislation that Zack Space supported "would cost the average household approximately $1,761 per year in increased energy rates."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/13/bob-gibbs/state-sen-bob-gibbs-claims-cap-and-trade-passed-ho/	Even though cap-and-trade legislation is stalled in Congress, that hasn't cooled its use as a campaign weapon. Republicans are wielding it as an anti-job, anti-family energy tax pushed by Democrats. GOP Senate candidate Rob Portman warns in a campaign ad that it would cost Ohio "jobs we cannot afford to lose." House Minority Leader John Boehner this week blasted the legislation as part of Democrats' "job-killing agenda." And in congressional races, Democrats who supported the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill that passed the House last year are under fire for their votes. In the 18th Congressional District, Republican State Sen. Bob Gibbs has his sights trained on Rep. Zack Space, a Democrat. Space voted for the bill even though he knew it "would cost the average household approximately $1,761 per year in increased energy rates," Gibbs says on his campaign website. This is a claim we've heard before. We decided to once again run it through the Truth-O-Meter to set the record straight. At its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Presumably, the costs associated with that end up getting passed on to consumers. In a state like Ohio, a cap-and-trade bill could hurt, because there aren’t enough alternatives right now to coal-fired electricity. And there are fears that switching from coal to cleaner technologies could cost jobs. That's something that resonates in the 18th, which sprawls across much of Ohio's coal country in the Southeast part of the state. The $1,761 figure has been widely circulated among cap-and-trade critics. A Google search for the $1,761 and "cap and trade" yielded more than 3,100 references almost instantly. The Gibbs campaign cited blogger Declan McCullagh, who wrote about it Sept. 15 in his Taking Liberties blog at CBS News online. We looked into it after Sen. Lamar Alexander made a similar remark that also cited the McCullagh article as its source. Here's what we found. McCullagh wrote about Treasury Department documents acquired by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, through a Freedom of Information Act request. Some documents were from 2008, shortly after the election, according to the group. Others appear to be from early 2009. "The Obama administration has privately concluded that a cap and trade law would cost American taxpayers up to $200 billion a year, the equivalent of hiking personal income taxes by about 15 percent," McCullagh wrote. "A previously unreleased analysis prepared by the U.S. Department of Treasury says the total in new taxes would be between $100 billion to $200 billion a year. At the upper end of the administration's estimate, the cost per American household would be an extra $1,761 a year." The Treasury Department never cites the $1,761 figure. McCullagh told us via e-mail when we checked this figure in September 2009 that he came up with it on his own. He divided $200 billion by the number of households in the United States. According to the census, there are about 113.5 million households in the country at the time. People involved in the climate change debate told us then that McCullagh's methodology is flawed. Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said that the math is too simple and doesn't reflect the true impact of the cap and trade legislation. For example, the Treasury documents reflect the Obama administration's plan that every polluting permit would be sold, starting when the bill was enacted. Waxman-Markey scaled that back. It would give out about 85 percent of the permits for free early in the bill's implementation. Also, the cap-and-trade bill provides that as much as 40 percent of the revenue from sales of those permits would go back to electric utilities to be passed on to consumers to offset higher utility rates. The money would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. "What [Treasury] was looking at was a situation where 100 percent of the permits were auctioned, and ignored what would be done with revenue," Seidel said. "The bottom line is that it goes back to the consumers." And higher energy costs are not a sure thing. Regional cap-and-trade programs in Europe and in the northeast United States show that auctioning most or all credits have actually decreased the cost of energy, said Barry Rabe, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan. Meanwhile, the entire debate may be moot. The Senate wouldn't rubber-stamp the Waxman-Markey measure. Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, introduced a slightly watered-down version, and coal-state Democrats like Ohio's Sherrod Brown were pushing to get concessions added for places like the Buckeye State, but even that could not get traction. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tabled it in July. Regardless, what all of this illustrates is that there are various plans out there, in addition to Waxman-Markey itself, and different interest groups, economists and lawmakers use different analyses to project the potential job losses or gains from these proposals, and the different costs involved. Relying on the calculations of a blogger rather than computations from respected analysists might border on reckless. That takes us back to the annual family cost estimate that Gibbs is using and others have used. The claim that households will pay $1,761 a year in higher energy costs was based on calculations that were fundamentally flawed. The Treasury data that was used wasn't even prepared based on the legislation that was passed by the House. The data did not account for revenue that would be returned to consumers in the form of rebates and other efficiency measures. Furthermore, the Treasury figures were prepared under an assumption that that all permits would be sold, which, ultimately, was not the form that Waxman-Markey took. When Lamar Alexander used the number in a statement, we rated it False. Yet here it is again, still relying on the the same flawed data and just as wrong as when we said it was wrong then. Strike a match. We rate this statement about the costs of cap-and-trade worthy of Pants on Fire. Comment on this item.	None	Bob Gibbs	None	None	None	2010-08-13T08:00:00	2010-08-12	['None']
pomt-10410	"I think we came down here (to Florida) one time ... but we weren't actively fundraising here."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/30/barack-obama/maybe-not-a-lot-but-obama-held-fundraisers/	Due to a pledge not to campaign in Florida — as punishment for Florida holding an early primary on Jan. 29, 2008 — Sen. Barack Obama had been a no-show in the Sunshine State since last fall. Obama tried to make up for lost time with his first big campaign swing through Florida in mid May. On May 22, the day Obama drew a crowd of 15,000 for a speech in Tampa, St. Petersburg Times political editor Adam C. Smith asked Obama in a private interview if the no-campaign pledge might have consequences with Florida voters. "Do you see why some Floridians would be offended by that? Raising money but not willing to talk about issues?" Smith asked. Said Obama: "I think we came down here one time, I think for a day, after that rule was passed, because we already had a series of things that were scheduled. But we weren't actively fundraising here." That might come as news to some of the folks who attended a $1,000-per-person fundraiser Obama attended at the home of Tim and Donna Main in St. Petersburg on Sept. 30, or to the 200-plus guests who donated $1,000 apiece to hear Obama make a brief speech at the home of David and Lisa Grain in Sarasota on Nov. 5. According to press accounts, on Sept. 30, 2007, Obama appeared at private fundraisers at homes in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Miami. On Nov. 5, Obama stopped in for a fundraiser at the bayfront home of a supporter in Bird Key, Sarasota. According to the Sarasota Herald Tribune, more than 200 guests paid at least $1,000 each or committed to raise as much as $10,000 for Obama's campaign. And Michelle Obama attended three fundraisers at private homes in Florida — in Tampa, Sarasota and Coral Gables — on Dec. 13 and 14. Miami lawyer Kirk Wagar, Obama's Florida finance director, downplayed those fundraising efforts. The late September fundraisers were planned in August before the pledge and Obama was simply following through on a commitment, he said. And the November fundraiser was a quick stop-off on Obama's return from a campaign trip to Puerto Rico. Obama is on such a whirlwind campaign tour, he probably just forgot about that other brief fundraiser in November, Wagar said. And Wagar doesn't count the visits to Florida by Michelle Obama. "He'd have been specifically talking about himself," Wagar said. Frank Sanchez, a top Obama fundraiser and adviser in Tampa, said Obama's statement is "pretty accurate." "Three visits in nine months, from a fundraising perspective, is pretty dismal," Sanchez said. "He came down here twice, and Michelle came down once. That's fundraising? Not in my book." Even without Obama making visits, the campaign's money-raising machine chugged along quite nicely. One night earlier this year, the Obama campaign had fundraising events at 100 different house parties around the state. In all, the campaign raised more than $9-million for Obama in Florida by the end of March, Wagar said, with about $5.5-million coming from donations of $200 or more. They'd have raised a lot more, Sanchez said, if Obama had not signed the pledge against campaigning in Florida. "Nothing compares to when we have the candidate or their spouse," Sanchez said. Assuming that Obama was talking about the three Sept. 30 fundraising parties when he referred to the campaign's one visit to Florida, that still leaves out the Nov. 5 fundraiser in Sarasota. No, that's doesn't amount to a whole lot, and some may consider it nitpicking to say otherwise. But the fact is that after signing the "no campaigning" pledge, Obama came to Florida twice — a month apart — and held four private fundraising events. We call that active fundraising. And while Obama's Florida finance director doesn't think Michelle Obama's visit counts when Obama says "we" have only been to Florida one time, we think it does. We rate Obama's statement False.

pomt-01425	Job creation has gotten worse each year that Scott Walker has been governor.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/08/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-job-growth-has-gotten-worse-every-/	Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke wasted little time getting to Topic A -- Wisconsin job growth under Gov. Scott Walker -- during a Wisconsin Public Radio interview Sept. 29, 2014. Two and half minutes in, Burke ripped Walker for the number of jobs created in the three and a half years that he’s been in office. She then put a new spin on what is the central theme of her campaign. "Frankly, it’s not getting any better," Burke told host Joy Cardin. "The longer he’s in office, the worse it’s getting." She continued: "So, 2013 job creation was worse than 2012, which was worse than 2011. And 2014 is shaping up to be the worst year ever, with the loss of 4,300 jobs in August alone." Burke’s repeated this claim, most recently Oct. 6, 2014 in an interview on Postcrescent.com. In January 2014, we rated False a very similar claim by state Rep. Brett Hulsey (D-Madison), who failed in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. But that was months ago and numbers are prone to change. Does Burke’s claim fare any better? In a word: No. Burke’s evidence When asked for backup, Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki essentially repeated the candidate’s claim: "The longer he is in office the worse it gets -- 2013 was worse than 2011 and 2012. 2014 is on pace to be the worst year for job creation yet." But he didn’t repeat it exactly. Burke said every year has been lower than the previous year -- like walking down the stairs. Zepecki said only that 2013 was worse than both 2011 and 2012. As support, Zepecki cited numbers for only two of the years: 33,872 jobs in 2012 and 29,723 in 2013. That’s OK, we’ve done this math before, and here is what it showed in terms of jobs added for each year: 2011 (Walker’s first full year in office): 29,800 2012: 33,872 2013: 29,723 So, the results show 4,072 more jobs created in 2012 (when compared with 2011), and then 4,149 fewer jobs created in 2013 (when compared with 2012). That’s not a series of steps down, but a step up and then a step down. The figures are from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ quarterly jobs count. They come from surveys of nearly all state employers and are regarded as the most accurate way of counting jobs. Burke’s observation that 2014 is on track to be the worst of all is based on monthly BLS jobs numbers, which are prone to much wider swings. So far, through August 2014, those numbers show the state has added 8,800 jobs in 2014. That doesn’t seem very good. But the eight-month mark has not always corresponded with the annual total. In 2011, after eight months, the state had added a total of 900 jobs for the year, according to the monthly estimates. The final total for the year, based on the more accurate Census figures, was 29,800. In 2012, there was a similar pattern -- minus 500 jobs after eight months, but a year-end total of 33,872. In 2013, there was less growth. There were an estimated 26,210 jobs after eight months, and the year-end total was 29,723. We have tracked Walker’s 2010 promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his four-year term on the Walk-O-Meter. Based on lagging numbers, and dwindling time, we have rated the pledge Promise Broken. You can see an updated monthly graphic tracking the state’s jobs performance since Walker took office here. Our rating Burke said job creation has gotten worse each year that Scott Walker’s been governor. The data says that’s not the case -- it’s been an up and down performance. And employers have continued to add jobs, albeit not at a strong pace. We rate the claim False.

pomt-14681	Says Hillary Clinton "is under investigation with the FBI right now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/jeb-bush/heres-whats-wrong-jeb-bush-saying-hillary-clinton-/	Editor's note: Since this story published, more information has come to light about the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email setup. Read an updated article here. If Hillary Clinton becomes president, she might find herself preoccupied with an FBI investigation, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said at a Republican presidential debate in South Carolina. "She’s under investigation with the FBI right now," Bush said Jan. 14. "If she gets elected, her first 100 days — instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the court house." Actually, Clinton is not under FBI investigation. The inquiry to which Bush refers revolves around the private email server Clinton used while serving as secretary of state. And it is not a criminal investigation. Here are the facts. In July 2015, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community sent what is called a security referral to members of the executive branch. A security referral is essentially a notification that classified information might exist in a location outside of the government’s possession. In this case, the location was Clinton’s private email server. Soon after, the New York Times incorrectly reported that the inspectors general requested a criminal investigation into Clinton’s email use — as opposed to a security referral. But the newspaper later issued two corrections. The referral was in connection with Clinton’s account, not whether Clinton herself mishandled information, and did not allege criminal activity. Officials told reporters at the time that the FBI was not targeting Clinton specifically. As part of its inquiry, the FBI has looked into the security setup for Clinton’s home server and a thumb drive that has copies of Clinton’s work emails. But most details of the investigation have remained secret. It’s even unclear at this point whether the FBI probe is just a preliminary inquiry or if it has evolved into a true investigation, according to Politico. Describing the inquiry, FBI Director James Comey told Congress in October 2015, "The FBI is working on a referral given to us by inspectors general in connection with former Sec. Clinton’s use of a private email server." He declined to give any more specifics. Earlier this month, Fox News reported that the FBI was broadening its investigation to look into whether any connection between the State Department under Clinton and the nonprofit Clinton Foundation violated public corruption laws. Clinton denied that FBI was pursuing this line of inquiry. However, Fox bases its report on unnamed sources, so we cannot independently verify it, nor have any major media outlets. Bush’s campaign and the FBI did not respond to our requests for comment in time for publication. Our ruling Bush said Clinton is "under investigation with the FBI right now." Not quite. The FBI is conducting a general inquiry into the security of Clinton’s private email server. But law enforcement officials have said Clinton herself is not the target of the inquiry, and it is not a full-blown criminal investigation. Clinton’s actions are clearly front-and-center in an FBI investigation. But Bush goes too far to claim Clinton herself is under investigation. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-08430	Rick Scott "doesn't have any ties to a lobbyist."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/oct/18/jennifer-carroll/jennifer-carroll-says-rick-scott-has-no-ties-lobby/	Rick Scott, the millionaire Republican gubernatorial candidate, is a businessman who has never been elected to public office. He has promoted himself as someone outside of the political GOP establishment, which largely backed Bill McCollum, a former congressman and current attorney general, during the primary. Clearly, the lobbyist/insider GOP crowd had hoped McCollum would win. But since he won the primary Aug. 24, 2010, Scott has had to make nice with those involved in GOP politics in Florida -- and they with him -- in hopes of defeating Democrat Alex Sink. Generally, that would include lobbyists. In a Sept. 27 speech to the Broward Republican Executive Committee we attended -- the Broward County party's central group -- Scott's running mate Jennifer Carroll tried to reinforce that outsider image for Scott. Listen to Carroll around minute 5:30 on this video posted on the Sun-Sentinel Broward Politics blog: Rick Scott "doesn't have any ties to Tallahassee, he doesn't have any ties to a lobbyist,'' Carroll said. She continued but some of her comments were drowned out by cheers. For this Truth-O-Meter we will check, is Scott devoid of any ties to lobbyists? We e-mailed and called spokespersons with the Scott campaign for several days starting on the morning of Oct. 1 to ask what Carroll meant when she said Scott "doesn't have any ties to a lobbyist." We heard back Monday, Oct. 4, when Carroll spokeswoman Erin Isaac responded in a brief e-mail: "Clearly, Rep. Carroll was noting that Rick is not a career politician, but an outsider who risked his own money on a campaign to get this state back to work. As governor, Rick will be beholden to no one except the citizens of Florida." We agree that Scott is not a career politician and spent his own money on his campaign. But note that Isaac did not address the claim Carroll made about him lacking ties to lobbyists. We would define a tie to a lobbyist as receiving campaign donations from lobbyists, attending fundraisers hosted by lobbyists on his behalf, or employing lobbyists in Scott's Florida companies. Fundraisers hosted by lobbyists Let's start with the post-primary fundraisers. An item in the Miami Herald's Naked Politics blog Sept. 3 stated that Scott had a fundraiser at the offices of lobbyists. "After his morning fundraiser at Associated Industries of Florida, Republican Rick Scott continues the rounds in Tallahassee today with a $10,000 a person fundraiser at the offices of health care lobbyists Jon Johnson and Travis Blanton at 3:30 p.m. today. Question to ponder: what is the definition of 'insider?' " On Aug. 28, The Buzz blog of the St. Petersburg Times published an e-mail from lobbyist Marty Fiorentino inviting others to a reception with Scott in Jacksonville "so we can get to know Rick better" and asked that participants bring five checks or $2,500. So, Scott has attended fundraisers hosted by lobbyists. Donations by lobbyists Next we wanted to check whether any lobbyists had donated to Scott's campaign. First we went to the Florida Division of Elections website to search Scott's contributions from anyone who identified themselves as lobbyists for reports through Sept. 17 -- the most recent report posted by the time Carroll made her claim. Note that it's possible that some contributors were listed as attorneys, consultants or by other titles who are also registered lobbyists. But here are contributors in the order the Scott campaign listed them who were identified on Scott's own fundraising reports as lobbyists. All but one were after the primary and many on the same day. • Stephen S. Dick. June 25. $500 • David I. Bitner. Sept. 2. $500 • Henry Dean & Associates. Sept. 7. $500 • Paul R. Bradshaw. Sept. 8. $500 (Sally S. Bradshaw, listed as a consultant at the same address, also gave $500 the same day. She was a chief of staff to former Gov. Jeb Bush.) • Jefferson Monroe Consulting. Sept. 8. $500 • Johnson & Blanton. Sept. 8. $500 • Steven J. Madden. Sept. 8. $500 • David A. Rancourt. Sept. 8. $500 • Stacey S. Webb. Sept. 8. $500 • Brian D. Ballard. Sept. 13. $500. (Kathryn Ballard, listed as a homemaker at the same address, gave $500 the same day.) • John M. Stipanovich. Sept. 14. $500 • Hunt-Watters. Sept. 15. $500 A few of those lobbyists -- Paul Bradshaw, Madden, Rancourt, and Webb work at Southern Strategy Group. Those listed as lobbyists in the campaign reports add up to about $6,000 (add another $1,000 if you include the two donors at the same address as the lobbyists) out of $807,582.45 in monetary donations by Sept. 17. Scott's campaign is largely bankrolled on his own money. So he also accepts money from lobbyists. But wait, we're not done yet. Still more donations by lobbyists We also checked the donors to Scott's electioneering communication organization Let's Get to Work. That campaign finance report identified two as lobbyists: • Susan Goldstein Consulting. Aug. 13. $1,000 • Larry J. Overton & Associates. Aug. 19. $5,000 But we recognized a couple others who work as lobbyists including: • Ronald Book. Aug. 17. $25,000. Attorney • Brewton Plante. Aug. 13 and Sept. 20. $7,500. Attorney. We feared we could have missed many lobbyists who were listed on campaign finance reports by other occupations such as "consultant" or "attorney." With the help of St. Petersburg Times Tallahassee bureau chief Steve Bousquet and Miami Herald bureau chief Mary Ellen Klas, we found several other lobbyists who gave directly to Scott's campaign account. We verified that these donors were 2010 registered lobbyists on the state's legislative lobbyist database and/or the executive branch lobbyist database. Here are a sample of the some of the well-known lobbyist donors to Scott's campaign we found: • Akerman Senterfitt: Sept. 14. $500. Has several clients including Miccosukee Tribe of Indians and City of Miami. • Thomas Arnold: Sept. 8. $500. Southern Strategy Group whose principals include the state's agency for health care administration and several companies. (He was Medicaid director under Bush and, under Gov. Charlie Crist, served as secretary of the Agency for Health Care Administration.) • Peter Antonacci: Sept. 8. $500. Works for Gray Robinson. Clients include cities of Hollywood, Key West and several other entities. • Wilbur Brewton: Sept. 14. $500. Brewton Plante firm. Calder Race Course in Opa-Locka is among the clients. • Colleen Castille: July 15 and Sept. 8, total of $600. Go Green Strategies. Several different clients including environmental-related entities. Castille was a former secretary for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection from 2004-2007. • Jorge Chamizo: Sept. 16. $500. Floridian Partners. Clients include Cuban-American Bar Association, North Broward Hospital District, Florida Power & Light. • Dutko Poole McKinley: Dutko Worldwide's clients include Comcast, Florida Power & Light, Miami Dade County. (Dutko Poole McKinley is a subsidiary of Dutko Worldwide.) The company's website states that managing partner Van B. Poole is a former state House minority whip and a state Republican Party chair (he is actually a past chair.) • John French. June 17 and Sept. 8, total of $1,000. (On June 17, The Buzz described French as the records custodian for Scott's Let's Get to Work political committee and as an election law specialist and paid consultant to Scott's campaign.) • Fowler White Boggs: Sept. 14. $500. Clients include U.S. Sugar Corp. • Beth Gosnell: June 4. $500. BG & Associates International in Tallahassee. Clients include AT&T and Florida Power & Light. • The Rubin Group. May 21. $500. Note we could have kept going but stopped around the letter "G" after we had made the point. Lobbyist donors to Scott's campaign include those with high-placed ties within state government and represent some major companies in Florida as well as public entities with interests ranging from gambling to the environment. To put it bluntly, these are some hot-shot lobbyists with influence in a range of state government areas. Employing lobbyists What about Scott the businessman himself? We wanted to know if he had employed lobbyists. We checked Solantic, the company of urgent care centers Scott co-founded. The 2010 legislative lobbyist database for principals did not include Solantic but the 2009 legislative lobbyist database and the 2009 executive branch lobbyist database included three for Solantic: Melissa Akeson, William Rubin and Heather Turnbull, who all work for The Rubin Group, according to that company's website. We sent most of our findings to Isaac, Carroll's spokeswoman, and she did not dispute them in her Oct. 4 e-mail reply to us and did not respond when we contacted her again with our findings on Oct. 18. Our ruling Carroll told the Broward GOP in September that Scott "doesn't have any ties to a lobbyist." Scott wasn't the go-to preferred pick among the lobbyist crowd during the primary. But he has taken multiple donations from lobbyists and, since the primary, lobbyists organized at least two fundraisers for him. And in 2009, Scott's Solantic employed Florida lobbyists. It would be extremely unusual for any statewide candidate who won the primary to be completely devoid of lobbyist ties. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, appeared on Fox News to discuss the gridlock in Washington over spending and debt. Fox host Megyn Kelly asked Gohmert whether he thought the effort to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law -- even to the point of closing the government and risking a default -- was "nonetheless worth pushing for." Gohmert answered by referencing a group of children who had appeared at an earlier event with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. "We have stolen from those children," Gohmert said in the Oct. 15, 2013, interview. "We went from $160 billion deficit spending in (President George W.) Bush's last year to $1.6 trillion the following year." When we checked Gohmert’s math, we found some problems. (His office did not respond to an inquiry.) • Using the historical federal budget figures provided by the Office of Management and Budget, we found a year in which the deficit was a little over $160 billion -- but it was fiscal year 2007, which ran from Oct. 1, 2006, to Sept. 30, 2007. That was a year and four months before Bush left office, so it’s not correct to call this the deficit from "Bush’s last year." Using the 2007 figure makes Bush’s record less profligate, since 2008 was the first full year of the Great Recession, and the weak economy helped push the deficit for fiscal year 2008 quite a bit higher, to $459 billion. • The annual deficit never actually hit the $1.6 trillion level Gohmert cited. It topped out at $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009. Responsibility for that fiscal year was split between Bush and Obama, though the exact parceling of responsibility is knotty due to a number of unusual expenditures that were made to combat the financial crisis and which owe a portion of their existence to actions by both presidents. (See a full discussion of this debate here and here.) • Gohmert was also incorrect when he said the big increase in the deficit occurred within the span of one year. The rise from $160 billion to $1.4 trillion took place over two years -- fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2009. This is not to say Gohmert doesn’t have a point. The deficit did go up significantly between the end of Bush’s tenure and the beginning of Obama’s. However, it’s worth remembering that the increase had a lot to do with the timing of when the Great Recession hit, and the contrast in "blame" for the deficit isn’t as clear. It’s a stretch to suggest Bush had little role and give all the responsibility all to Obama. In addition, the scale of the increase isn’t as big as Gohmert said it was. His claim on Fox News suggested that the deficit had increased tenfold in the space of just one year. The actual increase was about threefold over the course of one year -- a major bump, but one-third of what Gohmert suggested. Our ruling Gohmert said, "We went from $160 billion deficit spending in (President George W.) Bush's last year to $1.6 trillion the following year." It’s true that the deficit did go up significantly between the end of Bush’s presidency and Obama’s, but Gohmert erred in most of the key numbers of his talking point, and he oversimplified the question of which president is at fault for the rising deficits. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Louie Gohmert	None	None	None	2013-10-18T17:55:58	2013-10-15	['None']
pomt-01314	Democrats give "Newports to the homeless to get them to the polls."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/28/tucker-carlson/carlson-democrats-use-newports-get-out-homeless-vo/	Lost in the spectacular turmoil over who took Florida in the 2000 presidential election was a kerfuffle in Milwaukee, Wis., over 10 packs of cigarettes and some homeless voters. Though it was never proven, the story goes that a few days before the polls opened, a New York Democratic activist gave men from the Milwaukee Rescue Mission cigarettes in exchange for their votes. Conservative pundit Tucker Carlson alluded to this episode during the banter on Fox News’ noontime show Outnumbered Oct. 2. "I don't think as a general matter you should be encouraging people who don't know anything about what they're voting for to vote," Carlson said. "That's what the Democrats do, giving Newports to the homeless to get them to the polls. That's literally true. Republicans shouldn't follow suit on that. You shouldn't pander to people." A reader asked us to check whether there was any substance to Carlson’s dig at Democrats. The basic events in Milwaukee On the Saturday before the election on Nov. 7, 2000, Connie Milstein, a long-time Democratic donor from New York, was in Milwaukee. Milstein and some colleagues went to the mission and offered to give anyone who was interested a ride to City Hall to pick up an absentee ballot. About two dozen men took up the offer and at some point, 10 of them were given a pack of cigarettes each. We don’t know, however, if they were promised the cigarettes in advance or asked for a smoke afterwards and were treated to a full pack. And we don’t know if the promise of cigarettes was in exchange for a vote. In Wisconsin, it’s illegal to give a person anything worth more than $1 to induce them to vote. The cigarettes cost about $3.25 a pack. Republicans cried foul and pressed local prosecutors to file charges against Milstein. The Milwaukee County District Attorney’s office was reluctant, if only because it might have cost thousands of dollars to bring the case to trial. Months later, after an investigation, Assistant District Attorney Kurt Benkley said he didn’t think the evidence proved anyone was guilty. In May 2001, Milstein agreed to pay $5,000 in a civil forfeiture, a legal term that admitted no guilt and closed the case. Milstein’s lawyer Stephen Glynn told PunditFact that there was no evidence of a quid pro quo (a smoke for a vote). "No one said that, ‘If I went to vote, I would receive cigarettes,’ " Glynn said. Nonetheless, the campaign for Al Gore distanced itself from Milstein and released a statement right after the event happened saying her efforts were "not the kind of help we ask for and it’s the kind of help we flat out reject." We emailed Carlson and asked for any background he could provide for his statement. We did not hear back. We could find no other example of cigarettes being offered to voters. Why Newports? The oddest feature in Carlson’s statement is he specifically named Newport cigarettes. Benkley, the assistant district attorney, said he has no idea where that came from because the brand of cigarette had nothing to do with the case. "Those facts would never have come into the public domain," Benkley said. And he added, "I don’t recall the brand." Bottom line: The Newport brand appears to be an invention. Our ruling Carlson said that Democrats give Newports to the homeless to get them to the polls. Based on the evidence, Carlson is citing an isolated case where authorities were unable to prove that votes were traded for cigarettes, or that the cigarettes were an enticement. On one occasion in Milwaukee, as many as three Democrats gave rides to homeless men to City Hall to cast absentee ballots. At some point, they gave some of the men cigarettes. There is no evidence that the cigarettes were Newports, and investigators did not find that the cigarettes were offered as an inducement to vote. Calson emphasized that his account was "literally true," but by that standard, it is inaccurate on several points. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-13697	Says Donald Trump "claimed our armed forces are 'a disaster.'"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-has-called-us-mi/	National defense was one of the themes Hillary Clinton touched on when accepting the Democratic nomination for president, and she used it to criticize her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. She pledged to use United States military power to strike the terrorist group ISIS and to block online efforts to radicalize young people, promising to prevail even if "it won't be easy or quick." "Now Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, 'I know more about ISIS than the generals do.' No, Donald, you don't," Clinton said. "He thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are 'a disaster.'" "Well, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee and I know how wrong he is," she continued. "Our military is a national treasure." For this fact check, we'll see it Trump actually characterized the United States military as a disaster. When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Tim Hogan said it came during the sixth GOP primary debate, on Jan. 14, 2016. We checked the context. Trump used the line in the midst of a response to a question from Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network, who asked about South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s reference to Trump as one of "the angriest voices." Trump responded by saying, "I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry." That assertion came at a time when other GOP candidates were expressing concern that the military had become too weak, a concern shared by some Democrats as well.. We couldn't find any other comments from Trump characterizing the military as a disaster, but he recently and repeatedly has said it is "depleted." For example, during a July 12 campaign rally in Indiana, Trump said, "You know, the United States they said had never lost a war. Now we never win. We don't win on trade. We don't win with our military. Our military is so depleted. Our military has fighter jets that are in use, flown by great, great American people that are so old and they can't get parts for the fighter jets. These are people flying these jets now in combat. They can't get parts. So they go to the plane graveyards, in the deserts." The Clinton campaign pointed to an interview from July 11, 2016, on WAVY-TV in Virginia. In the interview, Trump said, "Right now we have a military that’s depleted and in horrible shape." Other Democrats have picked up on the "disaster" statement in their attacks against Trump. We contacted several people at the Trump campaign seeking reaction. They didn't offer a response. Our ruling Clinton said Donald Trump "claimed our armed forces are 'a disaster,’" a comment that suggests mismanagement and incompetence. Trump did, in fact, use that characterization once during a debate in January. More recently, he has called it "depleted" and focused more on what he suggests is a lack of resources. His comments have been slightly unclear, but recent ones have not been as broadly critical as his comment in the CNBC debate. So we rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d969506-aff2-493d-813a-af0c939fb75b	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-07-29T01:03:27	2016-07-28	['None']
pomt-13153	"There are Justice Department policies against" FBI Director James Comey discussing details of a federal investigation "so close to an election."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/30/robby-mook/clinton-campaign-says-comey-letter-violates-justic/	Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager criticized FBI Director James Comey for sending a bombshell letter to Congress that the bureau is looking to examine new evidence relevant to Clinton’s email case. Comey’s letter, sent less than two weeks before the election on Oct. 28, informed committee chairmen and ranking members that the FBI is pursuing options to review newly discovered emails that may be "pertinent" to the case. But given that Comey can't provide more details about the emails, according to reports, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook called the move "very curious." "Let’s just get all the information out there so that the rumors and the hypotheticals can be put to rest. And again, we’re hearing a lot of criticism now from former Justice Department officials, from former Clinton administration, former Bush administration, pointing out this is unprecedented," Mook said Oct. 30 on Meet the Press. "There are Justice Department policies against doing something like this so close to an election." Mook is right that the Justice Department — which oversees the FBI — not only explicitly prohibits employees from interfering with elections but urges employees avoid the appearance of interfering with elections. In August 2008, President George W. Bush’s attorney general, Michael Mukasey, sent an internal memo entitled "election year sensitivities" to employees on the department’s policies on political activities. Part of it reads: "Simply put, politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations or criminal charges. Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party. Such a purpose is inconsistent with the Department's mission and with the Principles of Federal Prosecution." Attorney General Eric Holder resent the memo in March 2012. While the memos don’t discuss limitation of timing specifically, former U.S. attorneys have alluded to an unwritten guideline about not filing cases or commenting on investigations in the 60 days before an election. Citing the policy, several former prosecutors and department employees have aired concerns and criticisms. Two former deputy attorney generals under the Clinton and Bush administrations called Comey’s actions a departure from the department’s traditions and "real-time, raw-take transparency taken to its illogical limit." Conservative Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a former prosecutor and New York county court judge, said Comey’s letter "disgraces and politicizes" the bureau. "You know I support Donald Trump and want him to win, but whether it's Hillary Clinton or anyone else, Comey's actions violate not only longstanding Justice Department policy … but the most fundamental rules of fairness and impartiality," Pirro said. Daniel Richman, a former prosecutor and current Columbia Law School professor, noted that while the Justice Department’s election sensitivities policy does stand, Comey also had different obligations to consider. Department policies "are subject to judgments by the highest officials in extraordinary circumstances," Richman said. "Less flexible is the FBI’s directors duty of absolute candor to Congress, requiring the correction of statements when new facts arise." Others experts we reached questioned Comey’s action. It was "premature to say anything before he knew more facts," said Peter Zeidenberg, a former prosecutor at the department’s Public Integrity sector who supports Clinton. Even if Comey had turned up new evidence — for example, more classified emails — Zeidenberg told PolitiFact he doesn’t believe director should have prioritized transparency over the election sensitivity policy if the evidence didn’t change his analysis that there’s no case against Clinton. Our ruling Mook said, "There are Justice Department policies against doing something like this so close to an election." The department prohibits its employees from interfering with elections. That policy generally has included being sensitive about what information is released about pending or active investigations in the days and weeks leading up to the election. However, there is no hard and fast rule, and an expert said Comey has the ability to exercise his judgment based on the facts as he knows them. Mook’s claim is accurate but needs that additional information. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6d484835-85f1-4ba4-999e-8405d52337e6	None	Robby Mook	None	None	None	2016-10-30T16:14:27	2016-10-30	['Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation', 'United_States_Department_of_Justice']
pomt-00707	Rhode Island "charter schools are nationally recognized as outperforming their counterparts across the country."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/apr/30/rose-mary-grant/rose-mary-grant-says-ri-charter-schools-outperform/	The subject of charter schools — the state money they get and the regulations they operate under — has been at the center of legislative debate among state lawmakers and educators through much of the General Assembly’s 2015 session. On March 29, the head of school at Highlander Charter School in Providence wrote an opinion column in The Providence Journal that framed the debate around the academic growth of students enrolled in the state’s 25 charter schools. "All of Rhode Island loses if we cut funding to the very schools that are nationally recognized as outperforming their counterparts across the country," Rose Mary Grant wrote. We can’t fact-check whether "all Rhode Island loses." That’s an opinion. We were, however, intrigued by Grant’s statement that Rhode Island’s charter schools "are nationally recognized as outperforming their counterparts." By "outperforming," Grant did not claim that charter schools here are producing students who are more proficient than students elsewhere in the country. Rather, Grant wrote that charter schools in Rhode Island had more impact on their students than charter schools in other states. "Rhode Island is moving students at a higher rate," Grant said in an interview. "They are outperforming the pack at moving the students who need to move the most." The basis for her claim is a 2013 study that developed a particular metric — tied to test scores and the performance of both charter school students and traditional public school students — for measuring the improvement of learning of each state’s charter school students. Based on this measure, the learning gains of Rhode Island charter students exceeded those of their peers in traditional Rhode Island schools, according to the National Charter School Study, a 95-page research report from the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University. Students in traditional Rhode Island schools would need 86 days of additional instruction to show the degree of reading improvement seen in the charter schools students. In math, they would need an extra 108 days of instruction. Also, the total difference in learning gains was greater in Rhode Island than the 27 other states studied, according to the report. The Stanford researchers listed Rhode Island among nine states that "deserve mention" for charter school performance that "outpaced" traditional school performance in both reading and math. In contrast, the report shows that charter school students in 10 of the 27 states fell behind their peers in traditional schools. The study covered 2005 to 2011 and reviewed the records of 1.5 million charter students in 27 of 42 states with charter schools, representing 95 percent of the nation’s charter students. Here’s how the research was done: The center logged charter school students’ math and reading scores on tests taken prior to their enrollment in charter schools. This allowed the researchers to establish a starting point. The researchers identified a student in the traditional school system whose scores put him or her at the same starting point as the particular charter school student. They also matched traditional and charter students on demographic factors including gender, race and eligibility for free or reduced-price lunches. The researchers say they found a "virtual twin" for each of the charter school students. But one critic, Andrew Maul, a statistician and assistant professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, has a problem with the methodology. Maul suggests that families who select charter schools might be different from those who do not. Such a difference can affect a student’s performance, he says. We reached out to the project director, Margaret E. Raymond, for a response. She argued that the matching process did sufficiently account for factors such as family background. A student’s past school performance, which governed the matching, is a function of family background, Raymond said. One point emphasized by the report’s authors, but not mentioned by Rose Mary Grant, is the importance of overall proficiency, not just improvements over peers. "To measure how much they [charter schools] contribute to student academic growth is clearly essential," says the report. And although the researchers compared gains posted by charter schools, they did not present data that would allow one to compare the proficiency of Rhode Island charter school students with their counterparts in other states. In other words, the study details how much charter school students in Rhode Island are gaining. It does not describe how proficient they ended up being in math and reading. "It is true," Raymond wrote in an email, "that the effect in Rhode Island of attending charter school was shown to be larger than other states included in the study." "But, ultimately," according to the report, "students need to be prepared for ‘what comes next,’ be it the next grade span or post secondary education or career advancement, so absolute achievement is also important." Our ruling The study that Grant cited in her column did show that the learning gains of the state’s charter school students surpassed the learning gains of their Rhode Island peers and that these gains were greater than gains in the other states that participated in the study by Stanford’s Center for Research on Education Outcomes. But the writers of the study cautioned educators not to lose sight of the importance of proficiency. Grant did not reflect this concern in her column. Further, while she boasts that Rhode Island charter schools were "nationally recognized," the study cites Rhode Island as one of nine states that "deserve mention." For these reasons, we rule the statement Mostly True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-05706	After President Barack Obama’s health care law takes full effect, "100 percent" of Americans will "depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/08/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-after-obamacare-all-americans-w/	In a speech to supporters at the end of the Super Tuesday primaries on March 6, 2012, Rick Santorum offered a set of statistics designed to highlight what he sees as the growing dependence of Americans on the federal government. "In a very short period of time, the next two years, a little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them," Santorum said. "After Obamacare, it will not be less than 50 percent; it will be 100 percent." We will take up the two parts of this statement in separate items. In this item, we’ll look at whether it’s correct that after President Barack Obama’s health care law takes full effect, "100 percent" of Americans will "depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them." To analyze this claim, we will first have to review what we wrote about the first half of the claim, so that we can provide a baseline for how many Americans currently receive federal benefits. We used a table produced by the U.S. Census Bureau that offers data for the average number of Americans who received benefits from selected government programs during a three-month period between January and March 2010. As we noted, the table includes such non-means-tested programs as Social Security, Medicare, unemployment compensation, veterans' compensation, workers' compensation, railroad retirement and veterans' educational assistance. It also includes such means-tested programs as Medicaid, food stamps, the Women, Infants, and Children program, federal Supplemental Security Income, public or subsidized rental housing, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, free or reduced-price school breakfasts and lunches, energy assistance and other cash assistance. The Census Bureau found that in the first quarter of 2010, 48.5 percent of Americans lived in a household where at least one member received one or more federal cash or cash-like benefits -- close to what Santorum said. (Counting such items as amounts refunded from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies would push that number higher, but we won’t do so here.) We can think of two provisions of Obama’s health care law that are equivalent to the items included in the Census Bureau calculation: increases in Medicaid enrollment, and subsidies to participants in the health care "exchanges." The exchanges are marketplaces created by the law that offer insurance coverage to Americans who aren’t already provided an option for affordable, employer-provided health insurance. Before we calculate the impact of these two provisions of the law, let’s set a few guidelines. We will use estimates for 2019, the latest year projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in order to judge the law’s fullest projected impact. We’ll calculate the percentage of the projected U.S. population in 2020 (the closest year we could find an estimate for) that receives one of these two federal benefits from the health law. CBO estimates that the number of Americans added to Medicaid through the health care law by 2019, above and beyond what would have occurred without it, will be 16 million. The number of participants in the exchange by then will be 24 million. Combined, that adds up to 40 million Americans receiving one of those two benefits by 2019. When you divide that by the population by 2020, which is projected to be 341 million, that works out to be a bit under 12 percent. In reality, this percentage could be higher or lower than 12 percent for various reasons, including the likelihood that many people in that category will already be receiving other federal benefits or will have too much income to qualify for the means-tested exchange subsidies. If you add the 12 percentage point increase due to the health care law to the 48.5 percent of the population already determined by the Census Bureau to be receiving federal benefits, you’d get a bit over 60 percent of Americans relying on federal benefits, well short of the 100 percent Santorum cited. In addition, no matter what, by 2019, 162 million Americans are projected to be receiving employer-based health insurance, and that means they won’t be newly added to either the Medicaid rolls or the exchange subsidy population. Even a skeptic about the health care law, Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute, thinks Santorum is off base. The law "will likely increase these numbers, especially since subsidies can extend to families of four with incomes of $88,000 per year," he said. "But I can’t see any way you get to 100 percent. Santorum may be suggesting that eventually Obamacare leads to a single-payer system. I think that’s a reasonable conjecture. But it’s not the law as is." The Santorum campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Our rating It’s likely that the new health care law will increase the number of Americans receiving benefits from the federal government, but it’s highly unlikely that it will push the percentage beyond 60 percent -- far from the 100 percent Santorum claims. We rate his claim False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-08T12:30:37	2012-03-06	['United_States']
pomt-00718	"About half of the presidents have been governors; half of them, senators."	false	/texas/statements/2015/apr/27/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-half-presidents-were-previously-gove/	Texan Rick Perry, the former governor who might bid again for president, has indicated he expects Americans in 2016 to prefer a governor for president over, say, a member of Congress. "If you’re in the Senate or if you’re in the House, you can give a speech and then go home," Perry said in November 2014. "Governors can’t. We have to govern." Texan Ted Cruz, the first-term U.S. senator who declared his candidacy for president in March 2015, recently countered that senators have often been president, David Weigel of Bloomberg Politics reported. According to Weigel’s recap, Cruz was addressing young Republicans in New Hampshire April 18, 2015, when someone asked what executive chops he could bring. Cruz responded by lambasting the "graybeards" in Washington, D.C. for coming up with the "senator versus governor" framework for president in the first place. And the idea that a governor makes for a better president than a senator, Cruz said, hasn’t been reflected in voter choices. "Here’s what history teaches us," Cruz said. "About half of the presidents have been governors; half of them, senators. There have been good and bad presidents who were both." Cruz closed out: "I think the test we ought to apply is not what job title a person had. I think the test we ought to have is: Who has stood up and fought?" Our test: Checking if Cruz was right about a 50-50 split between presidents who were governors and those who warmed up in the Senate. Counting presidents To sort the presidents, we leaned on the White House’s website presenting biographical sketches of the presidents and separately asked experts from the Institute for Presidential Studies at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, and the Washington, D.C.-based Center for the Study of the Presidency & Congress to run the numbers. Barbara Perry, the institute’s director, emailed us its initial sorting of the presidents; the center’s Alice Farrell emailed us its analysis. Statistically, Barbara Perry followed up by phone, Cruz’s statement was wrong in that around a third of presidents were previously governors, a third were senators and about a third were neither. Counting presidents Our own sort is here, showing: --NOT A GOVERNOR OR A SENATOR (14 PRESIDENTS): Three of the first four presidents--the exception being former Virginia Gov. Thomas Jefferson--were neither former governors or senators; the nation was young. Another 11 presidents also had neither distinction including Abraham Lincoln, Dwight Eisenhower, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush; --A GOVERNOR ONLY (13 PRESIDENTS): These include Grover Cleveland of New York, the sole president to win non-consecutive terms, Theodore Roosevelt (New York), Woodrow Wilson (New Jersey), Franklin Delano Roosevelt (New York)--and four of the six latest presidents: Jimmy Carter (Georgia), Ronald Reagan (California), Bill Clinton (Arkansas) and George W. Bush (Texas). --A SENATOR ONLY (11 PRESIDENTS): The first senator to be president was James Monroe of Virginia, who led the country from 1817 to 1825. And the next three presidents, including John Quincy Adams (Massachusetts) and Andrew Jackson (Tennessee), had been senators. Modern-era senators who moved up include Harry Truman (Missouri), John F. Kennedy (Massachusetts), Lyndon B. Johnson (Texas), Richard Nixon (California) and Obama. To our inquiry, University of Virginia researcher Bryan Craig placed James Garfield in this group. Garfield, a longtime House member, was elected to the Senate by Ohio lawmakers early in 1880 before winning for president in the fall. We placed Garfield on our "neither" list because he never served in the Senate. (Worse, he was shot in July 1881, dying that September.) --A GOVERNOR AND A SENATOR (5 PRESIDENTS): These were Virginian James Monroe; William Henry Harrison, who was governor of the Indiana Territory and then, years later, won election to the Senate seat from Ohio; New Yorker Martin Van Buren, who resigned his governorship after two months to become U.S. secretary of state; Andrew Johnson of Tennessee and John Tyler of Virginia. Upshot: Of the 43 men who have been president, 16 were former senators, 18 were former governors, 14 were neither. That is, 37 percent were senators, 42 percent were governors--and 33 percent didn’t serve as a governor or a senator. To reach these totals, we double-counted the five presidents who were both, giving credit where credit was due. Cruz’s point We shared slightly different preliminary counts with Cruz aides. By email, his campaign spokesman, Rick Tyler, responded: "What the senator was conveying to counter the false ‘executive experience’ narrative is there have been roughly an equal number of senators and governors who have served as president." Governors ascendant of late Of late, though, more governors than senators have advanced to the presidency including two--Clinton and Bush--elected to the job while serving as governor. Perhaps significantly, Obama in 2008 was the first senator to capture the presidency directly from a Senate seat since Kennedy in 1960, nearly 50 years earlier. Nixon and Lyndon Johnson, both former senators, each won election to the highest office after serving as vice president. Barbara Perry suggested governors have dominated in recent decades due to national upheavals--going as far back as the Vietnam conflict and the Watergate scandal-- leading voters to distrust candidates with records rooted in Congress. "The more candidates could separate themselves" from Washington, she said, the better, giving governors an edge. Our ruling Cruz said about half of the presidents have been governors; half of them, senators.

pomt-12212	"We now have about one-third of New York’s population on Medicaid."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/jul/21/john-faso/one-three-people-new-york-are-medicaid/	Rep. John Faso, R-Kinderhook, says Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo could do a better job managing the state’s Medicaid program. He has proposed legislation to shift Medicaid costs from counties to the state. Counties outside New York City pay close to $2.3 billion in Medicaid costs annually. Faso says the state could handle the expense if Cuomo cut costs elsewhere or lowered Medicaid spending, which topped $28 billion last year according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy analysis group. That’s more than Texas and Florida combined. "We now have about one-third of New York’s population on Medicaid," Faso said. "Some people in Albany may look upon that as an accomplishment. I look upon that as a failure." New York is one of 31 states and the District of Columbia that expanded income eligibility for Medicaid, an option under Obamacare. That opened the door for those who may have been unable to get health insurance otherwise. But is Faso right that a third of the state’s population is on Medicaid? Medicaid numbers in New York About 6.4 million people received Medicaid benefits in New York as of April 2017, the most recent count from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The agency includes enrollees in the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which insures children from families with incomes too high for Medicaid but too low to buy insurance. The state’s population is 19.74 million, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau numbers. That makes Faso right: 33 percent of the state’s population is enrolled in Medicaid. New York has the second-highest Medicaid participation rate in the country. New Mexico ranked first with almost 38 percent on Medicaid. New York ranked highest before the Obamacare expansion with almost 29 percent of the state’s population on Medicaid in 2013. Our ruling Faso said a third of New York’s population is on Medicaid. The latest federal data supports his claim: One of every three New York residents is enrolled in Medicaid. We rate his claim True.

pomt-08180	Said the Washington Post argued that a failure to pass the START treaty this year would be "no calamity," and that the Associated Press said "the administration concedes the security risk is not immediate."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/29/jon-kyl/jon-kyl-cites-washington-post-editorial-ap-fact-ch/	As Washington delves into a brief lame-duck session before the new Congress begins work in January, one issue receiving wide attention is whether the Senate will ratify a new START treaty to control nuclear arms, as the Obama Administration wants. The treaty would enact modest nuclear-weapons reductions and extend verification provisions that lapsed last year. Most Democrats and many foreign-policy professionals favor ratification of the new treaty, which would require 67 votes in the Senate. But the effort has run into problems with Senate Republicans, particularly with Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona. Kyl said earlier this month that the lame duck session did not offer enough time to iron out problems he sees with a related issue -- U.S. plans for modernizing nuclear forces and infrastructure. The administration took up the gauntlet, redoubling efforts to ratify the treaty this year. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Vice President Joe Biden wrote that "national security interests are at stake" in the ratification battle. On the Nov. 28, 2010, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, host David Gregory grilled Kyl on his concerns about the treaty. We won't get far into the policy details here, but we do think that fact-checking one portion of the dialogue might help illuminate a key element of the debate -- namely, whether delaying ratification would put national security at risk. Here's a portion of what Kyl said: "First of all, let me quote the Washington Post, which directly addressed the question that you asked. 'No calamity will befall the United States if the Senate does not act this year.' And in response to the charge that somehow we need to do this for the urgency of needing verification, the Associated Press did a fact-check on that allegation and said, 'The urgency is political. Even the administration concedes the security risk is not immediate.'" Essentially, Kyl uses two mainstream news organizations to bolster his argument that there's little risk from a delay in ratification. We wondered whether Kyl used these quotations accurately and in context. Let's first look at the excerpt from the Post. It came from an editorial -- that is, an unsigned statement of opinion by the newspaper's editorial board -- titled, "The New START pact should be passed, not politicized." Right off the bat, that sounds unlike Kyl's suggestion to take more time. Kyl did relay the specific quotation accurately, and the editorial does provide some support for Kyl's position. In addition to arguing that "no calamity will befall the United States if the Senate does not act this year," the editorial argued that "the Cold War threat of a nuclear exchange between Washington and Moscow is, for now, almost nonexistent. The administration and Congress could advance America's 21st-century interests more tangibly by completing and approving the free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama -- to name just one issue that matters more than U.S.-Russian arms control." The editorial also suggested that the administration's urgency to ratify the treaty now may have less to do with foreign policy concerns and more to do with the Senate's balance of power. (Democrats will have a narrower majority in January.) The editorial called Biden's claims of a national security risk "hyperbole." But a substantial portion of the editorial runs counter to Kyl's view. In fact, it takes Kyl to task personally, saying that he "acknowledged months ago that the treaty is 'relatively benign'" and adding that the White House has "gone a long way to meet (Kyl's) concerns." Yet "rather than take yes for an answer, Mr. Kyl blindsided the administration this week with a statement claiming that not enough time remained this year to ratify the treaty given 'the complex and unresolved issues related to START and modernization.' That was hard to credit." In addition, the editorial lists several foreign-policy objectives that could be hurt by delaying ratification. A delay, it argued, "would put the administration's 'reset' of relations with Russia at risk -- along with Moscow's cooperation on vital matters like Iran's nuclear program and maintaining secure military supply routes to Afghanistan. It might lessen the willingness of nonaligned nations to cooperate with sanctions against Iran and other would-be proliferators. And it could cause both friends and foes of the United States to question Mr. Obama's leadership." In all, the editorial offers a pretty evenhanded approach, rather than one strongly supportive of Kyl's position. "Both sides would do well to stop maneuvering for political advantage and return to the negotiations that appeared close to winning the necessary support for the treaty before the midterm elections," the editorial counseled. Now for the Associated Press "fact check," which looked at Obama's statement on Nov. 18 that "it's about national security. This is not a matter than can be delayed." Under the heading "The Facts," the AP wrote that "the urgency is political. Next year the Republican ranks in the Senate will expand by six and it will be much more difficult to ratify the treaty. Even the administration concedes that the security risk is not immediate. 'I am not particularly worried, near-term,' Obama's top adviser on nuclear issues, Gary Samore, said Thursday. 'But over time, as the Russians are modernizing their systems and starting to deploy new systems, the lack of inspections will create much more uncertainty.'" The AP continued, "Intelligence officials have expressed concerns that have sounded less than urgent. 'I think the earlier, the sooner, the better. You know, my thing is: From an intelligence perspective only, are we better off with it or without it? We're better off with it,' the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said recently." While the AP fact-check is less forceful than the Post editorial board was in its criticism of Kyl's position, Kyl, in his Meet the Press interview, did leave out the second, more worried portion of Samore's comments, as well as the argument by Clapper that "we're better off with" the treaty in place. We try to grant politicians some leeway in television interviews because their comments are necessarily time-constrained. And we certainly understand why Kyl would have wanted to play up the supportive evidence in the two news items and downplay what didn't fit his agenda. But we do think that the way he abridged them amounts to cherry-picking. He selectively quoted from the accounts, leaving viewers with a distinctly different impression than they would have had if they'd read the items in their entirety. So we rate his comment Half True.

pomt-10825	"What they will do is socialized medicine."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/18/rudy-giuliani/pure-hyperbole/	Is Hillary Clinton's plan "socialized medicine"? In Tampa on Monday, Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani said of Clinton's plan: "What they will do is socialized medicine." Mitt Romney made a similar statement, calling Clinton's plan "a European-style socialized medicine plan — that's where it leads — and that's the wrong direction for America." Clinton's plan would call for individuals or their employers to bear all or part of the cost of health premiums. It would also rely on private insurance companies to offer plans, just as they do today through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. The government insurance that would be offered under Clinton's plan would be modeled on traditional Medicare, which has been supported by both political parties. Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of economics at Princeton University, said the Clinton plan relies heavily on private insurance companies to provide coverage. "If the insurance industry calculates this carefully, they'll make money off it," he said. According to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary , socialized medicine is "a system of medical care regulated and controlled by the government, in which the government assumes responsibility for providing for the health needs and hospital care of the entire population, at no direct cost or at a nominal fee to the individual, by means of subsidies obtained by taxation." It's inaccurate to call Clinton's proposal "socialized medicine." It doesn't meet that definition because the government would not control the system and because of the heavy involvement of private insurance companies — which could turn a profit from the plan.

pomt-03393	Rhode Island's graduated driving license "has saved hundreds of lives."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/07/joseph-mcnamara/rep-joseph-mcnamara-says-graduated-license-require/	Among the bills debated by the Rhode Island House on June 28, 2013, was H-5047, which would require six hours of on-the-road driver training from a Rhode Island training school before anyone would be eligible for a driver's license. The bill -- which would have made it tougher for schools located in adjacent Massachusetts and Connecticut communities to do business here -- was submitted at the request of an unnamed driver training school operator in Rhode Island. It passed the House on a 42-to-26 vote but never made it through the Senate. One supporter, Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, said he was in favor of anything that improved the quality of young Rhode Island drivers. "As the original author and sponsor of our state's graduated driving license, which has saved hundreds of lives since it was initiated -- the gradual implementation -- I support any legislation that improves driving safety, especially for young people," he said. Hundreds? That would be quite an accomplishment in a state where the number of highway deaths annually seldom exceeds 85. We decided to investigate. The graduated driving license program placed tough restrictions on teen drivers. It extended the minimum time for a learner's permit, created a limited license and gave a full license only to young drivers who remained ticket- or accident-free for one year. The legislation was passed in 1998 and took effect in January 1999. When we called McNamara, he said his statement was based on a comparison of teen fatalities before and immediately after the adoption. "Initially there was a severe drop, from double to single digits," he said, explaining that he had extrapolated from there. Such a drop wouldn't be unexpected. Various studies published more than a decade ago had suggested that similar programs reduced teen crashes and fatalities among teen drivers by as much as 58 percent. McNamara didn't have any Rhode Island numbers handy, so we called the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. The best source of online data is the Fatality Analysis Reporting System of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It goes back to 1994, five years before the implementation of Rhode Island’s graduated license system. RIDOT broke down the numbers for us for drivers ages 16, 17 and 18 who were most likely to be affected by the graduated license program. In 1998, the year before that system took effect, there were 74 highway fatalities in Rhode Island. In 10 of those cases, a driver was 16 to 18 years old. The driver wasn't necessarily killed and wasn't necessarily at fault. The following year, with the new law in place, the total number of fatalities rose to 88 but the number of fatalities in which the drivers were ages 16-18 dropped from 10 to 4. That's six fewer. If the graduated license program was responsible -- a major assumption -- and the trend persisted for each subsequent year, that would be 78 lives saved through 2012, not the hundreds McNamara claimed. But the trend didn't continue. The number of fatalities in the young driver category started rising over the next few years. By 2002 it was 12, higher than any of the five years prior to the implementation of the law. During the five years before adoption, the total number of fatalities involving drivers 16-18 was 41. During the five years after adoption it was 42, essentially the same. However, during the five years after the graduated license system was adopted, the total number of traffic fatalities rose by 25 percent. One could argue that if the youngest drivers had been part of that trend, there should have been about 51 deaths during that five-year stretch instead of 42. Even under that scenario, that translates to two lives saved per year, or 28 saved since adoption of the law. That's still a far cry from hundreds. Our ruling McNamara said the Rhode Island graduated driving license law he authored "has saved hundreds of lives." To meet that standard, you would have to see at least 200 fewer deaths on the state's highways since the law took effect in 1999. But the data from five years before and five years after implementation -- even if viewed in the most favorable light -- show an impact that isn't even close to McNamara's claim. We rate it False.

pomt-03616	Says that under Rick Perry’s plan, "Texas has cut funding for public schools by 25%."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/may/07/fix-austin-schools/group-says-under-perrys-plan-texas-cut-funding-sch/	Fix Austin Schools, a group advocating voter approval of four bond propositions benefiting the Austin school district, slammed Gov. Rick Perry’s "education plan" in a leaflet fielded by local voters in early May 2013. Under the word "cut" in capital letters, one side of the leaflet says: "Under Rick Perry, Texas has CUT funding for public schools by 25%," a conclusion attributed to PolitiFact. Lynda Rife, a consultant to the group, told us the claim echoed our January 2013 review of Perry’s statement to reporters at the time that Texas public school funding grew at three times the rate of enrollment from 2002 to 2012. In raw terms, there was a basis for Perry’s claim. However, after adjusting for inflation and the effect of an annual tax swap put in motion by lawmakers and Perry in 2006, we concluded that Texas schools in 2012 were fielding 25 percent less in state aid than what they reaped in 2002. Perry’s claim drew a rating of False. At the time, we looked at enrollment changes and at both overall school spending, counting dollars from state, federal and local sources, and state education aid alone. Enrollment Enrollment increased about 20 percent from 2001-02 to 2011-12, from more than 4.1 million to nearly 5 million students, according to a December 2012 report by the Texas Education Agency. By email, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us 2012-13 enrollment was expected to exceed 5 million, a figure subsequently confirmed, Ratcliffe told us recently by email. Overall spending Overall school expenditures totaled $27.9 billion in 2002 and $44.2 billion in 2012, according to a chart from the Legislative Budget Board, which tracks fiscal issues for lawmakers. That makes for a difference of 58 percent, though that’s also before adjusting for inflation, which the board’s staff did by converting figures to 2004 dollars using an inflation adjuster devised by the federal government, the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government. In 2004 dollars, Texas public school spending in 2002 totaled $30.1 billion. In 2012, the total was $33.3 billion--11 percent greater than in 2002. By this measure, then, it looks like school enrollment went up faster than spending. Then again, we learned, these figures were not behind Perry’s statement. State spending alone Perry’s then-spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, told us by email that Perry was referring to the difference in state education spending alone "as those are the funds the state has control over." The budget board’s chart shows $10.9 billion in state spending on the schools in 2002 and $18.9 billion in 2012, for a 73 percent difference, or a little more than Perry’s declared 70 percent. Adjusting for inflation, though, reduces the increase to 20 percent, which was still outpacing enrollment growth. In 2004 dollars, such spending was $14.2 billion in 2012, compared with $11.8 billion in 2002. Another crucial factor Analyst Eva DeLuna Castro of the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities and school lobbyist Lynn Moak, a former Texas Education Agency official, each pointed out another wrinkle, suggesting that any consideration of state education spending should take into account changes in law approved in 2006 resulting in the state picking up about $7 billion more in annual costs in return for school districts cutting local maintenance and operation property tax rates. Castro said by email: "The property tax cut was $14.2 billion a biennium, or $7.1 billion every year. That means the state had to put in that amount of money a year to offset local property taxes falling by the same amount." The shift in funding sources did not, in itself, step up aid received by the schools, Castro said. Moak said by phone: "This was simply a source-of-funds transfer." To adjust for the annual cost shift, we subtracted $7.1 billion from the state spending in 2012, suggesting a $0.9 billion difference from the 2002 spending. However, adjusting for inflation makes the 2012 state spending equal $8.2 billion in 2002 dollars--25 percent less than the $10.9 billion spent in 2002, which also would mean that spending trailed enrollment growth. For this article, finally, we weighed the message that the reduced spending was Perry’s education plan. Perry was governor through all the spending decisions, but the reality is that Republican majorities of the 150-member House and 31-member Senate were needed to pass the decisions into law. Perry was key, but he didn't dictate actions. No governor can. Our ruling The pro-bonds’ group said that under Perry’s education plan, Texas has cut funding for public schools by 25 percent. State education spending in 2012 was 25 percent lower than it was in 2002, adjusting for inflation and the real effects of the 2006 law giving the state more responsibility for education revenues. Yet Perry didn’t cause the reduction by himself; lawmakers acted, too. This clarification is missing from the group’s statement, which we rate as Mostly True.

pomt-08091	Says Lee Leffingwell has been mayor of Austin, Texas "for about as long as Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska."	false	/texas/statements/2010/dec/15/paul-begala/democratic-wag-paul-begala-says-austin-mayor-lee-l/	Democratic banterer Paul Begala, a former Bill Clinton adviser who was once student-body president at the University of Texas, tried a Texas tack on CNN's "Situation Room" Dec. 6 to poke at Sarah Palin possibly being the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. Palin governed Alaska, Begala said, which he described as home to fewer people than the Texas capital of Austin. An Austin American-Statesman editorial columnist, Ken Herman, later noted that Alaska has about 700,000 people, while Austin has about 786,000. Begala continued: "Now, quick: Who's the mayor of Austin? Turns out it's Lee Leffingwell. And Lee Leffingwell's been the mayor of Austin for about as long as Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska, but nobody is saying that Lee Leffingwell ought to be president." We're not getting into the population contrast or Leffingwell's designs on the White House. But has he been hizzoner about as long as Palin was governor? According to a city of Austin web page, Leffingwell's term as mayor started June 22, 2009. So he's held that post for nearly 18 months of his three-year term. Palin was sworn into office as Alaska's governor Dec. 4, 2006, according to the Associated Press. She resigned effective July 26, 2009, according to another AP news article, having served about 32 months of her four-year term. We asked Begala about his calculation. He replied by e-mail that while he checked the populations of Austin and Alaska, he also "should have checked the mayor's duration in office versus Palin's. I stand corrected." In the spirit of his broadcasted Palin dig, Begala added: "So in another year and a half let's run the mayor for prez." No comment. His statement is False.

pomt-14762	Since 2008, Gwinnett County’s population has grown 15 percent, while the county government staff has increased only 1 percent.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/dec/11/charlotte-nash/Nash-on-target-with-Gwinnett-population-staff-dat/	Some local governments, including Gwinnett County, are still dealing with the effects of the Great Recession. They’re planning to set aside money in their 2016 budgets to continue restoring programs and jobs that were slashed or frozen when the economic bottom fell out. Gwinnett’s tax digest grew steadily until 2009 but lost 21 percent of its value by 2013, Gwinnett Commission Chair Charlotte Nash said Nov. 17. The digest is rebounding but isn’t expected to be back to its 2008 level until 2018, she said. So while Gwinnett’s population has grown 15 percent since 2008, the county government staff has only increased by 1 percent, Nash said. Could that be true? Since Nash is proposing a 2016 operating budget for Gwinnett of $1.1 billion and 82 new county jobs, PolitiFact Georgia decided to check First, a little background. The National Bureau of Economic Research, considered the official arbiter of U.S. recessions, identifies the Great Recession as roughly 18 months, from December 2007 to June 2009. The financial belt-tightening and pain was widespread, hitting families, communities and governments -- including the nation’s counties that collectively employee 3.3 million Americans. Georgia lost 340,400, or 8.5 percent, of its jobs, between 2007 and February 2010 and, consistently reported one of the nation’s highest home foreclosure rates in this period. Gwinnett’s proposed 2016 budget would fund 25 police positions that were frozen and restore staffing at the county animal shelter, correctional facility and parks maintenance. It also would return library funding to 88 percent of its 2008 level and reinstate longevity pay raises that were eliminated in 2009, as well as pay for short-term and long-range needs, Nash said. Checking the numbers For our fact-check, we contacted Joe Sorenson, communications director for Gwinnett County government, who provided us with county population and employment data dating back to 2008. The population estimates show Gwinnett, once one of the nation’s fastest growing counties, still steadily adding residents -- going from 780,721 in 2008 to 898,450 this year and forecast to have 919,290 residents in 2016. County government added 42 authorized positions to expand its workforce from 4,893 in 2008 to 4,935 in 2015. The county would have an authorized workforce of 5,022 under the proposed budget. This includes 30 extra police officers, above and beyond the 25 newly unfrozen jobs, as well as additional positions in the district attorney’s office, animal control and welfare, parks and recreation, water and sewer inspections, and in a medical unit in the county’s Fire & Emergency Services Department. So do the numbers we reviewed support Nash’s claim? The short answer is yes. The population estimates the county provided came from a private company and didn’t match exactly those we pulled from the U.S. Census Bureau. But the differences weren’t significant. (For example, the county estimate shows Gwinnett with 880,707 residents in 2014, the Census 877,822. Population estimates for 2015 also aren’t out yet from the Census Bureau.) Slow rebound Elizabeth Kellar, executive director of the Center for State & Local Government Excellence in Washington, D.C., said that, nationwide, local governments -- that includes cities, too -- cut about 500,000 jobs beginning in 2009. It wasn’t until 2013 and 2014 that local government human resources managers -- who the center surveys each year -- started reporting the trend turning from hiring freezes and layoffs back to hiring, Kellar said. Some county governments in metro Atlanta have smaller staffs today. For example, Fulton County government went from 6,866 permanent and non-permanent employees in 2008 to 5,229 in 2015, spokeswoman Jessica Corbitt said. That’s 1,637 fewer employees for a county that grew by more than 100,000, or about 12 percent in that period. DeKalb County didn’t grow on par with Fulton or Gwinnett, but also cut staff. Burke Brennan, county spokesman, sent us a graph, plotting filled full-time positions in county government each December from 2007 until this month. It shows the county currently has 6,057 full-time employees,16.3 percent lfewer employees than were on the payroll in 2007. Census Bureau estimates, which Brennan said should be viewed cautiously, show DeKalb’s population grew 5.3 percent, from 685,646 in 2008 to 722,161 in 2014. Our ruling Charlotte Nash, chairman of the Gwinnett County Commission, said that, since 2008, the population of the county has grown 15 percent while the government staff has increased by only 1 percent. The former county finance director is right on her stats. The budget discussion in Gwinnett also serves a reminder that the Great Recession is not that far back in the rear view mirror -- not when a goal for 2016 is returning library funding to 88 percent of its 2008 funding level. We rate Nash’s statement True.	None	Charlotte Nash	None	None	None	2015-12-11T00:00:00	2015-11-17	['None']
pomt-02055	Peter Kilmartin voted for the 38 Studios loan guarantee and his State House job was to "twist [legislator’s] arms to vote for deals like this."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/may/30/dawson-hodgson/dawson-hodgson-says-peter-kilmartin-voted-38-studi/	Dawson Hodgson, a state senator and Republican candidate for attorney general, is on the attack. A radio advertisement he released on May 27, 2014, faults Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat, for his role in the 38 Studios deal, which loaned money to a video game company that ultimately failed. That venture, undertaken with funds approved by the General Assembly, stands to cost Rhode Island $112.6 million over 10 years. In the ad, Hodgson notes that Kilmartin, at the time a state representative, voted for the loan program, which was ushered through the legislature in 2010 by then-House Speaker Gordon Fox. A narrator opens the ad with the words, "38 Studios. What a disaster." "You’d think that Attorney General Peter Kilmartin would tell us which insiders got us into this mess and how much money they made. But Kilmartin can’t do that. He’s been part of the problem from the beginning," it continues. "Peter Kilmartin voted for the $75-million handout that made it all possible. Even worse, as next in command to Gordon Fox, his job at the State House was to get his cronies in the back room, then twist their arms to vote for deals like this. Well, he did a pretty good job with that." "So don’t wait for answers on 38 Studios from the attorney general — because they’re not coming. And us? Well, we’re just holding the bag for millions of dollars. Not just this year. Every year. For years. It’s just unbelievable." Fox was Speaker of the House when that body voted 66 to 1 to approve a $125 million loan guarantee program that set the stage for the $75 million loan to Curt Schilling's 38 Studios. The company was not publicly identified as a potential loan recipient at the time. Kilmartin did, in fact, vote for the bill, although he and other legislators claim they didn’t know at the time that 38 Studios would be a beneficiary. But he wasn’t Fox's second in command when the vote went down, and was not assigned to the role of twisting arms to force support for the ill-fated deal, as the ad suggests. When we contacted Hodgson, he insisted that the ad doesn't actually say that. It simply says that Kilmartin was once Fox's second in command. That's all. Hodgson said the ad is accurate because Kilmartin at one time was the majority whip, a job that requires bringing fellow party members into line for a vote, when Fox was majority leader. But that was only up until Feb. 11, 2010, when Fox became speaker and Kilmartin withdrew from his leadership position because he was contemplating a run for attorney general. The House's vote on the loan guarantee program came on May 25, 2010, when Kilmartin had been out of the whip job for three and a half months. "I explicitly stayed away from saying (Kilmartin) whipped the 38 Studios bill," Hodgson said. "I was specifically referring to the time period that he was Gordon Fox's subordinate as the House Majority Whip." But he wasn't specific at all. And that's not the impression his ad leaves. From start to finish, the ad talks about 38 Studios. The title on YouTube is "Answers on 38 Studios." The ad talks about Kilmartin's vote in favor of the loan program. The fact that Kilmartin was Fox's second in command, the ad says, is "even worse." But at the time of the vote, Kilmartin wasn't Fox's second in command. He didn't even have a leadership position. Hodgson is taking facts that he knows are unrelated and linking them to give the impression that Kilmartin played a larger role in passing the 38 Studios bill than he actually did. "I was taking multiple time periods of his service and putting them into a combined time period," Hodgson said. "I stand behind every word of that ad. We drew it very carefully to withstand PolitiFact." Apparently he's unaware that PolitiFact's judges also take context into consideration. Hodgson’s ad seems deliberately crafted to give the erroneous impression that Kilmartin worked with Fox to secure votes for the 38 Studios deal. Taken in that context, Hodgson's claim commands a less-than-accurate rating on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09484	Says Paul Workman "voted in the Democrat primary, supporting Democrats with his vote."	true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/26/holly-turner/turner-says-workman-voted-democratic-primary/	For the three Republicans running for a Texas House seat representing southwest Travis County, the campaign trail has turned into a trial over who's consorting with the enemy. In that vein, transplanted Fort Worth lawyer Holly Turner has attacked opponent Paul Workman's voting history. In a radio ad that debuted Feb. 25, Turner accuses Workman of voting for Democrats. "Official records show he voted in the Democrat primary, supporting Democrats with his vote," the narrator says. Indeed? Craig Murphy, Turner's spokesman, pointed to Travis County's voting records. Our search shows that Workman voted in the 1994 Democratic primary, though he voted in the two previous GOP primaries and in eight Republican primaries from 1996 through 2010. So over 20 years, Workman voted in every Republican primary except for one in '94. What caused Workman to cross party lines and vote Democratic? We didn't find out; his campaign consultant, Eric Bearse, said Workman "doesn't recall voting in that primary." The record shows he did. We rate Turner's statement as True.

pomt-02838	"500,000 people have signed up for #Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/20/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-tweets-half-million-people-signe/	A lot of numbers were thrown at us when the White House finally announced on Nov. 13 how many individuals had signed up for health care coverage through online marketplaces. The general consensus, including from many Democrats, is the early returns were underwhelming. Still, there was a lot of confusion. How many successfully navigated through the error-laden federal marketplace website? Who actually purchased coverage? Where does Medicaid fit into all of this? Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., tweeted a simple breakdown. "This week we found out 500,000 people have signed up for #Obamacare," the chair of the Democratic National Committee said. "It's good news, but we have more work to do." But is that an accurate overview, or did she oversimplify it? We decide to break it down ourselves. To the numbers The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has the statistics of who signed up in the first month: From Oct. 1 to Nov. 2, 1,509,883 people applied for coverage through a federal or state marketplace. Of those individuals, 106,185 approved applicants actually picked an insurance plan — 79,391 through a state marketplace and 26,794 through the federal marketplace. About a quarter of the people who applied, or 396,261, were told they were eligible for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Wasserman Schultz’s office said her tweet came by adding those who picked a private insurance plan to those deemed eligible for Medicaid. And it’s true, adding those two figures together gets us 502,446. But have those people "signed up for Obamacare"? President Barack Obama didn’t put it so bluntly. Instead, at a Wall Street Journal CEO Council meeting Nov. 19, he said "About half a million Americans are now poised to gain health care coverage beginning Jan. 1." (Wasserman Schultz’s camp said they were simplifying matters to meet Twitter’s pesky 140-character limit.) We should note here that Obamacare is a complex law with many moving parts, not a single government program in which people enlist. (Wasserman Schultz knows that, but the average voter might not.) The Medicaid element in particular adds a perplexing twist. Medicaid is an existing state-federal health insurance program largely for the poor. The health care law allows states to expand Medicaid eligibility, and some states are doing that, while others aren’t. According to the Department of Health and Human services, about 400,000 individuals were "determined or assessed eligible for Medicaid or CHIP," but are they actually signed up? Does the applicant have to take additional steps to officially enroll, just as he or she must pick a plan after the application is processed? The federal health department said they shouldn’t have to. Instead, "the state Medicaid or CHIP agency takes additional steps to finalize an eligibility determination," according to a health department report. In states like Kentucky, who run their own marketplace, it’s pretty seamless. "We have a streamlined application process," said Jill Midkiff, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet of Health and Family Services. "Somebody comes in and gives the information, and if they’re determined eligible for Medicaid then they’re directed to Medicaid, and that happens pretty quickly." From there, the applicant picks a Medicaid provider, and if they don’t, one is assigned to them. For states operating under the federal marketplace, the process involves a bit more red tape. In some states, Medicaid eligibility is determined by the federal marketplaces, and if eligibility is met, the individual should be all set. In others, the final eligibility determination is left up to the states. Florida, for example, opted out of the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and chose not to operate its own marketplace. Some people applying through healthcare.gov are eligible for the state’s existing program. For those people, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families said determining final eligibility will be "quick but not automatic." But there’s a delay in that process. The federal marketplaces do not yet have the functionality to transfer Medicaid eligibility data to the states. And it’s unclear when it will be. With 36 states relying on the federal government to run the insurance marketplace, that could push back Medicaid enrollment for thousands beyond Jan. 1 if it is not fixed in the coming weeks. As another example, Arizona expanded Medicaid, but also allowed the federal government to run its exchange. There, officials are advising anyone who was told by the federal marketplace they may be eligible for Medicaid to just apply through the state’s online Medicaid portal. "Once all of these systems are running as they should, there will be no wrong door," said Monica Coury with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment Systems. "The account transfer of Medicaid eligible from the Marketplace to the state will be seamless. But for now, it’s not working as it should, and anyone that looks Medicaid-eligible needs to come in through the state’s site." A final note: It’s not clear how many individuals told they were eligible for Medicaid would have qualified even before the expansion of the program under Obamacare. Those numbers have not been released by the administration. So it’s possible a large chunk of new Medicaid enrollees would have qualified for the joint federal-state program prior to passage of the Affordable Care Act. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said "500,000 people have signed up for #Obamacare." The numbers add up if you count different parts of the law that work together to expand coverage, but it’s a little simplistic. The fate of many of the Medicaid enrollees remains up in the air due to the problems with the federal marketplace. It’s unclear whether those individuals will receive their benefits on time, and some are being asked to take additional steps to sign up. Her statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate her statement Half True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2013-11-20T18:19:19	2013-11-13	['None']
pomt-08704	On hearings about automatic citizenship provision in U.S. Constitution.	half flip	/texas/statements/2010/sep/07/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-was-quoted-saying-hearings-citizen/	U.S. Sen. John Cornyn "'crawfishing'" says a headline on an Aug. 30 web post by Tyler's KETK-TV. It's not describing the Texas senator's vacation plans. Instead, the headline suggests Cornyn backing off on favoring hearings on the constitutional provision entitling anyone born in the United States to citizenship. We wondered. The station's report says Cornyn was at a port of entry in Hidalgo, Texas Aug. 27 when he backed off "his earlier support for Congress reviewing birthright citizenship." The report quotes Cornyn saying that taking another look at the Constitution's 14th Amendment amid the national debate over immigration "is going after a symptom rather than the cause in the first place." (A symptom or cause of what, the report did not specify.) Cornyn previously backed calls for a review. Next, we contacted Cornyn's office, where spokesman Kevin McLaughlin said in an e-mail that the senator wasn't airing a new position. Rather, McLaughlin said, the original report on Cornyn's position, in the Aug. 5 Dallas Morning News, misrepresented Cornyn's willingness to participate in hearings as advocating them. The News' article describes Cornyn as the latest senator to call for a review of birthright citizenship amid complaints that illegal immigrants have abused that post-Civil War constitutional provision. The story notes that Sen. John Kyl, R-Arizona, had earlier suggested hearings in a TV interview and the Senate minority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, subsequently did the same. "We need to have hearings," Cornyn is quoted saying. "We need to consult constitutional scholars and study what the implications are." Cornyn is the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security. According to the News article, Cornyn said, "It's certainly within the power of Congress to" make changes either by statute or amending the constitution. But he is also quoted saying, "We need to tread carefully in this area, because we would be changing, frankly, settled law." McLaughlin said he watched the interview and that Cornyn didn't call for a review of the 14th Amendment but instead responded to the reporter's request for comment on that possibility. The "point (Cornyn) was making was not that he supported or opposed a review. His point was that if any of his colleagues want to change the Constitution, we should proceed with great caution and at least have hearings," McLaughlin said. We asked if the senator sought a correction or clarification from the newspaper. McLaughlin said not, adding in an e-mail: "They are pointless because papers bury them and no one reads them." From our review, it looks like the News' article had an impact on other coverage. From early August through Aug. 22, the Hotline, UPI, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and Politico.com referred to Cornyn as calling for or supporting hearings on birthright citizenship. Later on the very day of the Morning News' interview, McLaughlin said, Cornyn was in a conference call with reporters and answered a question about changing the 14th Amendment. McLaughlin shared a recording of Cornyn's answer, in which the senator again talked about treading "carefully." He said he'd want to take up the topic in the context of broad immigration reform; there's no mention of his position on holding hearings. McLaughlin said Cornyn's position was clearly spelled out in an Aug. 12 story in The McAllen Monitor, which quotes Cornyn saying that if members of both parties want to pursue the issue, he'd support hearings at least to air out the social and legal implications. "I would hope that (committees) would hear from a diverse group of people, including legal scholars, advocacy groups and ordinary citizens, including a lot of Texans," Cornyn said in a statement to the newspaper. "We don’t need to amend the Constitution to secure the border and reform a broken immigration system." The same day, the El Paso Times quoted a similar Cornyn statement. McLaughlin also pointed to an Aug. 27 Associated Press recap of Cornyn's latest remarks. According to the AP, Cornyn backed off his earlier support for Congress taking up birthright citizenship, but also told reporters his new remarks didn't reflect a shift in stance. Cornyn is quoted saying: "I was asked a question whether I would participate in hearings on the issue. And I said, 'Well, sure, I'm happy to do my job and listen to expert witnesses.' But upon further reflection I really think it is a symptom and not the cause." Recap: On Aug. 4, Cornyn told the Morning News "we need to have hearings" on the 14th Amendment, consult with scholars and study the issue but also should "tread carefully," a caution he also expressed in response to another reporter's question that day. Later, separate newspaper articles quoted him saying there's no need to amend the Constitution to address comprehensive immigration reform, a position he aired again on his recent trip to the Texas-Mexico border. Best we can tell, the stated "need" to hold hearings on the amendment wasn't repeated by Cornyn. His mention that he has given it "further reflection" underscores he's not as keen on the idea as he appeared to be in the oft-referenced Morning News' story. Yet Cornyn also hasn't gone so far as to say he's now against hearings. We rate this a Half Flip on the PolitiFact Texas Flip-o-Meter.

pomt-13739	"Donald Trump said he was excited for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of American families, because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/elizabeth-warren/elizabeth-warren-says-donald-trump-was-excited-200/	Sen. Elizabeth Warren's speech at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia was designed, in part, to convince Americans that the Republican nominee Donald Trump was no friend of the average person. Warren said Democrats fought to get health insurance for more Americans, refinance student loans, end tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas, raise the minimum wage and create a strong consumer agency "so big banks can't cheat people." "Where was Donald Trump? In all these fights, not once did he lift a finger to help working people," she said. "Look at his history," Warren continued. "Donald Trump said he was excited for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of American families, because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap." She was referring to the Great Recession, in which the housing mortgage crisis played a major role. Did Trump really get excited when the 2008 housing occurred because he saw it as a business opportunity? We touched on this before when Hillary Clinton claimed in a television commercial that "In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash." We ruled that claim Mostly True. But this claim is different. Warren's statement suggests that Trump was excited for the crash after it happened or while it was happening. But the only evidence we've seen predates the worst of the recession. We asked Warren's spokeswoman for evidence but didn't hear back. Here's what we know. The Trump statement in partly question is rooted in an audiobook How to Build a Fortune, created as part of Trump University, the controversial project that promised to have Trump teach enrollees how to become wealthy. It has been the subject of three lawsuits from former "students" who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire. The audiobook is from 2006, when it was not obvious that the real estate market was about to tank but there was concern that inflated prices had produced a bubble that might burst, dropping values. In the recording, Trump is being interviewed. He's asked, "There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?" "Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy," Trump responded. "You know, if you're in a good cash position — which I'm in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy." "If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money," he said in the section posted by CNN. However, Trump immediately added: "At the same time, I don't think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit." So Trump didn't think the crash was going to happen. The only other piece of evidence we've seen: A year later, in 2007, Trump told the Toronto Globe and Mail that he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down. "People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is," he told the paper. "I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets." But once again, it's clear that Trump wasn't predicting the scope of the housing crisis. "Donald Trump almost lost his shirt 15 years ago when the North American real estate bubble burst," the story begins. "The 2007 version of that disaster will be much more benign, the real estate magnate predicts. . . 'We're talking very minor (problems) compared with the depression of the early 1990s,' Mr. Trump said." The Globe and Mail story said he was advising investors to take advantage of the situation by buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices. It's all part of the philosophy that any wise investor uses: buy low and sell high. The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for reaction to Warren's statement. Our ruling Warren said, "Donald Trump said he was excited for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of American families, because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap." We haven't seen any evidence that Trump said he was excited about the crash once it happened, and Warren's office did not provide any. However, the existing evidence predates 2008, and it shows that Trump didn't think a crash was going to happen at all. He did make it clear that he would try to take advantage of a downturn in the housing market, but any good investor would try to do that. Warren’s statement puts Trump’s comments in the wrong context, but she has a point about his buying philosophy. Warren's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e349a2cd-2c08-4616-9147-8f8045f5dcdb	None	Elizabeth Warren	None	None	None	2016-07-26T00:48:21	2016-07-25	['United_States', 'Donald_Trump']
pomt-01887	Says Hillary Clinton's health care plan from the 1990s "had a broader provision in favor of corporate right to back out" of providing contraceptive coverage than the one created by the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/08/newt-gingrich/gingrich-hillary-clintons-health-plan-had-broad-re/	Republicans have been getting a lot of mileage out of the recent Supreme Court decision that brought a blow to the Affordable Care Act -- with the court citing a law enacted by Bill Clinton as part of its rationale. In Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, the court said the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act allows certain corporations to opt out of providing employees with certain contraception coverage -- which were mandated by the ACA -- because of the owners’ religious beliefs. Now, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich is saying Bill and Hillary Clinton’s health care reform plan from the 1990s also would have supported the court’s decision. In fact, Hillary Clinton’s plan -- which he calls Hillarycare -- would have been more favorable to corporations wanting to evade certain parts of Obama’s health care law. "Hillarycare, 20 years ago, had a broader provision. The bill that (former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.) introduced for Hillary had a broader provision in favor of corporate right to back out," of providing contraceptives based on religious beliefs, Gingrich said on Sunday’s ABC This Week. We showed Gingrich's statement to Sara Rosenbaum, a health policy professor at George Washington University, who played a role in drafting health care legislation for the Clinton administration. "I have absolutely no idea what he is talking about," she said. So what is Gingrich talking about? The Clintons' proposed Health Security Act, proposed in 1993, would have required all employers to contribute to employees' health insurance. All benefits packages would have included coverage for "family planning," including birth control. But the original proposal doesn't say anything about religious exemptions for employers. We weren't able to get a hold of Gingrich, but we think he's referring to this provision, included in a 1994 bill that Moynihan sponsored during the health care reform debate. (This bill was, however, separate from the Clintons’ plan.) Moynihan’s bill said, in part, "Nothing in this title shall be construed to prevent any employer from contributing to the purchase of a standard benefits package which excludes coverage of abortion or other services, if the employer objects to such services on the basis of a religious belief or moral conviction." In plain English, the law would not require an employer to utilize a benefits package that provided benefits that went against their religious or moral beliefs. Gingrich is right that this would be less restrictive than the provisions laid out by the Supreme Court in the Hobby Lobby decision, experts said. The court decision established fairly narrow restrictions for corporations looking to claim religious exemption from parts of the Affordable Care Act (though some say it creates a slippery slope). The decision said closely held corporations with strong religious convictions don’t have to offer insurance that covers four kinds of ACA-mandated contraceptives. Moynihan’s provision was less restrictive because it said employers don’t have to purchase plans that include "abortion and other services," but it does not specify the other services, said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor. Additionally, it includes "moral conviction" in addition to "religious beliefs," Jost added. The Religious Freedom and Restoration Act on which the court based its decision only applies to religious beliefs. But was creating an exemption for employers based on religious beliefs a primary tenant of the Clintons' health care plan? No, it wasn’t. The Clintons’ proposal Moynihan’s bill was not put forth on the Clintons’ behalf. Their plan did not include a religious exemption for employers clause, said Chris Jennings, former health care adviser to both Clinton and President Barack Obama, in an interview. "That was not related to the plan," Jennings said. In fact, Moynihan was routinely critical of the Clintons’ proposal, once calling the administration’s financing estimates "fantasy." Moynihan's proposal was one of several health care reform bills coming out of the 103rd Congress, and it certainly was not the one the Clintons wanted. It saw little floor time because it came up in August 1994, when the health care reform debate was winding down. No other version of the Health Security Act included a religious exemption provision for employers -- including another earlier version also sponsored by Moynihan. The primary health care bill -- sponsored by former Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. and backed by the Clintons -- included a provision that allowed health care providers to refuse to offer or perform services that went against their moral or religious beliefs, such as abortions. But the exemption did not extend to the employers contributing to health insurance costs. The congressional briefing book on the Clintons' proposed plan does not include the provision, either. Additionally, we spoke with experts who said they do not recall birth control as a major source of debate during the Clintons’ health care reform efforts. News coverage at the time seems to back that up. Contraception coverage "hadn't emerged as a goal of reformers at that point," said Paul Starr, a public affairs professor at Princeton University. "So the idea of a ‘corporate right to back out’ also hadn't come up." Abortion coverage was the primary point of contention, in terms of family planning, rather than birth control, Rosenbaum said. It’s possible that Moynihan added a religious exemption for employers in order to appease those who didn’t want comprehensive abortion coverage. But even so, it seems unlikely that the Clintons would have budged on providing universal abortion coverage. Around that time, Lorrie McHugh, a Clinton administration spokeswoman on health, told the New York Times that the administration stood by its original position that abortion should be covered "where a doctor deemed it medically necessary or appropriate. … We’ll fight for it." Our ruling Gingrich said Hillary Clinton's health care plan from the 1990s "had a broader provision in favor of corporate right to back out" of providing contraceptive coverage than the one created by the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision. We found that Sen. Moynihan did produce a health care bill, as part of widespread reform efforts, that included a religious exemption for employers that was broader than the provisions created by the court’s decision. However, Gingrich was wrong to connect that back to the Clintons. The Clintons’ health care plans did not include such a provision, and they did not back Moynihan’s bill. In fact, Moynihan was critical of the administration throughout the health care debate. Additionally, his proposal came up near the end of the reform efforts and didn’t generate much discussion. We rate Gingrich's claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/183923cd-a3bd-46d3-aca7-68b0ada766b8	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2014-07-08T11:06:29	2014-07-06	['None']
pomt-06644	The U.S. military "is in 130 countries. We have 900 bases around the world."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/14/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-us-has-military-personnel-130-nation/	During the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- a staunch advocate of limited government and a more modest military footprint -- offered a surprising statistic about the reach of the U.S. armed forces. "We're under great threat, because we occupy so many countries," Paul said. "We're in 130 countries. We have 900 bases around the world. We're going broke. The purpose of al-Qaida was to attack us, invite us over there, where they can target us. And they have been doing it. They have more attacks against us and the American interests per month than occurred in all the years before 9/11, but we're there occupying their land. And if we think that we can do that and not have retaliation, we're kidding ourselves. We have to be honest with ourselves. What would we do if another country, say, China, did to us what we do to all those countries over there?" That statement includes a lot of different claims, but we’re going to focus on just one of them here that a reader asked us to check -- that the U.S. military "is in 130 countries. We have 900 bases around the world." We’ll split this into two parts -- checking whether the U.S. military has personnel in 130 countries, and whether the U.S. has 900 overseas military bases. Personnel For the personnel question, we turned to a Sept. 30, 2010, Pentagon document titled, "Active Duty Military Personnel Strengths by Regional Area and by Country." We tallied up all the countries with at least one member of the U.S. military, excluding those with personnel deemed to be "afloat." We found U.S. military personnel on the ground in a whopping 148 countries -- even more than Paul had said. (There are varying standards for what constitutes a "country," so that may explain the divergence from Paul’s number.) However, we should add a caveat. In 56 of these 148 countries, the U.S. has less than 10 active-duty personnel present. These include such obscure locales as Mongolia, Nepal, Gabon, Togo and Suriname. By contrast, the U.S. has disclosed only 13 countries outside the United States and its possessions that are host to more than 1,000 personnel. They are: Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Japan, Bahrain, Djibouti, South Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait. In addition, this is a snapshot of the global military footprint, so it may not include all temporary training missions and humanitarian assistance activities. "Such activities are so pervasive you almost have to wonder how the other 70 countries manage to avoid hosting such operations," said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, a national security think tank. Bases For this question, we turned to an official Pentagon accounting of U.S. military bases around the nation and the world, the "Base Structure Report, Fiscal 2010 Baseline." According to this report, the U.S. has 662 overseas bases in 38 foreign countries, which is a smaller number than the 900 bases Paul cited. But here again, the list omits several nations integral to active operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, so it’s conceivable that the actual number of sites approaches 900. The Pentagon "is very reluctant to label anything a ‘base’ because of the negative political connotations associated with it," said Alexander Cooley, a political scientist at Barnard College and Columbia University who studies overseas bases. "Some of these facilities, such as the Manas Transit Center in Kyrgyzstan, may not be officially counted as ‘bases,’ but it is the most important U.S. facility in central Asia, staging every U.S. soldier transiting in and out of Afghanistan and conducting refueling operations." Still, caveats are in order here, too. Of the 662 overseas sites listed -- that is, those outside the active war zones -- all but 32 of them are either small sites (with a replacement value of less than $915 million) or sites essentially owned on paper only. For instance, the sole site listed for Canada is 144 square feet of leased space -- equal to a 12-foot-by-12-foot room. That’s an extreme case, but other nations on the list -- such as Aruba, Iceland, Indonesia, Kenya, Norway and Peru -- have just a few U.S. military buildings, many of them leased. Some of the sites are unmanned radio relay towers or other minor facilities. "Most of them are a couple of acres with a cyclone fence and no troops," Pike said. Cooley said that the "true figure is tough to determine and involves judgment calls about the nature and purpose" of the activities involved. "The fact that host countries often choose not to disclose a U.S. military presence adds to perceptions of a ‘secret network’ " that is larger than the officially disclosed number of bases. Our ruling Given the incomplete figures available from the Pentagon, Paul’s topline figures -- 130 nations, 900 bases -- are plausible when active military operations are included. "My eyebrows were raised many times" during the debate, Pike said, but this comment "was not one of those times." Still, we think it’s worth pointing out that many of the personnel deployments and facilities included in Paul’s number are fairly minimal in nature. On balance, we rate Paul’s statement Mostly True.

And a group of parents and education leaders is warning about changes to the state’s class credit policies. A reader asked us to check out a claim that has been making the rounds, including in a posting found on the Lilburn Patch website. The posting, by Nancy Gordeuk, claims that the state Department of Education is implementing a policy change that will limit parents’ choices of education options. "Do you realize that the Georgia Department of Education has implemented a new policy beginning in August that states that public schools will no longer accept credits from home school entities or non-traditional education?" Gordeuk writes in the Patch item. That seemed like a rather significant policy for the state to change, and we investigate the claim further. Gordeuk, a teacher, founded and operates TNT Academy in Lilburn. According to its website, TNT Academy is a nontraditional education center serving middle and high school students engaged in independent study. The academy also provides credit recovery for public school students who have failed a class. TNT Academy lists its accreditation from the Georgia Accrediting Commission along with the Chancellor’s Office of the University of Georgia and the Georgia HOPE scholarship program for nontraditional study centers. Gordeuk and other parents and nontraditional educators have started a petition to change the new policy they say will force parents to use only public schools. She said she was notified about the policy change in May when a television reporter came to her academy claiming the facility’s testing standards were not tough enough. (Gordeuk says Gwinnett County was trying to shut down her school). That story, reported by Channel 2 Action News, notes that Gwinnett, where TNT Academy is located, was changing its policies to ensure all students -- including home school and private academy students -- were held to the same academic standards. So, was the policy change a county or state effort? Sort of a mixture of both. In April, the Georgia Department of Education updated its policies for accepting high school transfer credits and grades. The new rules require local school systems to develop their own policies for validating credit for courses taken through home study programs, nontraditional educational centers and non-accredited schools. The local systems are required to outline procedures for determining whether transfer courses meet the state-adopted curriculum, among other items. "What we’re saying in the policy is at the local level they have to develop policy around who they accept courses from," Matt Cardoza, a spokesman for the state Education Department, told us. The state rules do not include a provision grandfathering existing centers and home school. Cardoza could not provide information on how Gwinnett’s school system was handling the state requirements, so we went to the source. Two months after the state Education Department approved its new policy, Gwinnett changed its policy on awarding units of credit and accepting transfer credits. The policy, approved by the Gwinnett school board on June 20, does not change the requirements for home schooled students, Gwinnett schools spokeswoman Sloan Roach told us. But students at nontraditional educational centers, such as Gordeuk’s TNT Academy, will have to follow the process currently in place for home schooled students. They will now have to take a state-mandated test or one provided by a local school system in order to validate the credit. Grades for course credit awarded through this process will be "pass" only and not appear as letter or number grades on report cards. High school transfer students must take any state-mandated tests including End-of-Course Tests. "In the past, (Gwinnett schools) would accept credits from anybody accredited by the Georgia Accrediting Commission," Gordeuk said. With the changes, "I think it all comes down to an issue of Gwinnett not wanting people to know how many of their kids are failing their classes." To sum up, Nancy Gordeuk, founder of a nontraditional education academy in Gwinnett County, said that the state Education Department changed its policies and will no longer accept class credits from home schools and facilities like hers. In April, the Georgia Department of Education did update its transfer credit policy. But the changes pass the decisions about accepting credits to local school districts. The local districts can determine which credits they will accept and from which education centers. In Gwinnett County, where Gordeuk’s facility is located, students seeking transfer credits from these centers must first pass a county-issued test. Gordeuk is correct in noting that the transfer credit policy has changed. But the local school districts can make the decisions on how that process is handled. We rated Gordeuk’s claim Half True.

pomt-06618	Says that in the recent year homeowners across Ohio have signed mineral rights agreements "and I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/20/michael-skindell/state-sen-michael-skindell-says-oil-gas-companies-/	Ohio Gov. John Kasich has enthusiastically cheered the money-making prospects of hydraulic fracking, a technique used to extract oil and gas from underground shale. Eastern Ohio, with its energy-laden Utica and Marcellus shale formations, is high on the list of targeted areas where companies are looking buy up rights to drill for the lucrative resources below. But many have voiced environmental concerns over the process, which pumps millions of gallons of chemical-laced water and sand deep into horizontal wells under high pressure. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is studying hydraulic fracking’s effects on drinking water. And New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican whose pugnacious and conservative style is often compared with Kasich’s, last month ordered a one-year moratorium on the practice so more information can be gathered. Enter Ohio State Sen. Michael Skindell. Skindell, a Lakewood Democrat, this month introduced Senate Bill 213, which would institute a ban on hydraulic fracking until the EPA completes its study and lawmakers have time to digest it. A companion bill would require companies to disclose chemicals it uses when drilling. Both pieces legislation are aimed at what Skindell sees as a fracking bonanza. "In the recent year, we have seen the oil and gas companies go to homeowners throughout Ohio and encourage them to sign leases and turn over mineral rights for this process," Skindell said during a Statehouse news conference to promote the two bills. "And I understand that over a billion dollars worth of leases have been signed to date." That billion-dollar figure caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention, given the relatively fledgling fracking market. True, reports across Ohio have pegged the Utica shale formations in eastern Ohio as a new frontier of sorts. But $1 billion? We went to Skindell to learn his source. Skindell shared with us a web link to a March story published by the Dayton Daily News. The newspaper focused on one company, Chesapeake Energy Corp. of Oklahoma City. Chesapeake, the article noted, "has reportedly spent $1 billion acquiring leases in Ohio without drilling a producing well, a figure reported by the Wall Street Journal on March 7." By the time it left Skindell’s lips, it was a fact repeated at least third-hand. If it was a fact all. So off to the Wall Street Journal we went. The March 7 story attributed the $1 billion figure to Chesapeake. Journal reporter Ryan Dezember referred PolitiFact Ohio to earnings statements and other financial documents from the publicly held company. Mindful that the news at this point was 6 months old, Dezember theorized that the figure had likely grown. Sure enough, a transcript of a July 29 conference call between Chesapeake executives, investors and analysts and Chairman and Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon confirmed this. "... We’ve spent between $1.5 billion and $2 billion acquiring leasehold in the Utica," said McClendon, referring to the shale in eastern Ohio. And of course, Chesapeake wouldn’t have invested that amount if executives weren’t convinced the resources could yield much more. In a financial report issued the day before the conference call, Chesapeake noted that officials believed the Utica shale play could add between $15 billion and $20 billion in value. Chesapeake is not the only party interested in Ohio shale. Clif Little, an Ohio State University extension educator in Guernsey and Noble counties, said more than 1,200 property owners have taken his "leasing farmland for oil and gas" classes this year. Drilling companies, small oil and gas companies, landowner associations and attorneys all are attempting to secure deep drilling rights, Little added. "The $1 billion figure is an old figure," Little wrote in an email. "The amount invested in the Utica and Marcellus would far exceed that number today, but I am no longer keeping track of investment figures." Although he might not have been right on the money, Skindell was very much in the ballpark with respect to Chesapeake’s figures. If anything, he undersold the political point he was trying to make: that Ohio is on the cusp of a fracking boom. Skindell’s words were "over a billion dollars worth of leases," and clearly that is the case. As a result, we rate Skindell’s statement True.

pomt-12168	Says transgender residents make up "about 1-in-300 people, we're all over the place, we're your friends and your neighbors."	true	/texas/statements/2017/aug/03/ashley-smith/ashley-smith-transgender-residents-1-300-greg-abbo/	A San Antonio activist tried to make a point about the proposed Texas law affecting bathroom access in public schools and other buildings simply by posing with a presumed leading supporter of the legislation, Gov. Greg Abbott. The photo from Abbott’s July 14, 2017, re-election kickoff rally in the Alamo City shows Abbott grinning next to "Trans-Woman" Ashley Smith. Smith added this comment in a post below the photo placed the next day on her Facebook page: "How will the Potty Police know I'm transgender if the Governor doesn't?" That post went viral though Smith later got our attention when she described the prevalence of Americans who are transgender, telling Chris Quinn of the San Antonio Express-News: "We're about 1-in-300 people, we're all over the place, we're your friends and your neighbors. Some of us are not immediately obvious as trans. And the idea that you are going to be able to enforce a bathroom bill, I mean the enforceability is just not there." We asked Smith the basis of her 1-in-300 figure. She pointed by email to a report finding that nationally, about 1.4 million residents were "trans," Smith said, "which if my math is right, would make us 1 in every 231 people." The June 2016 report, "How Many Adults Identify as Transgender in the United States?." was issued by the Williams Institute, a UCLA School of Law think tank that says it advances sexual orientation law and public policy through independent research. The authors, making statistical adjustments to Centers for Disease Control 2014 phone survey results, estimated that 0.6 percent of U.S. adults "identify as transgender." The report went on: "This figure is double the estimate that utilized data from roughly a decade ago and implies that an estimated 1.4 million adults in the U.S. identify as transgender." In 2011, an institute researcher, Gary Gates, had estimated based partly on surveys taken in Massachusetts and California that 0.3 percent of U.S. adults identified as transgender. The U. S. Census Bureau hasn’t estimated the number of Americans identifying as transgender. But we turned to its population estimates to gauge the institute’s latest figures. As of July 2014, the bureau says, the U.S. was home to 318,563,456 residents including 244,986,302 adults. Applying the institute’s estimate that 0.6 percent of adults identify as transgender delivers a subtotal of 1,469,917 adults. Summing up, the institute estimated that 1.8-in-300 U.S. adults identify as transgender. Minors identifying as transgender? For an estimate of younger Americans identifying as transgender, Smith told us, she relied on a January 2017 institute report similarly starting from federal surveys. That report says researchers estimate that 0.7 percent of U.S. minors aged 13 to 17, tallied at about 150,000 people, are transgender--which breaks out to about 2.1-in-300 individuals in the age group. The 2017 report includes a chart estimating transgender residents by age groups: SOURCE: Report, "Age of Individuals Who Identify As Transgender in the United States," the Williams Institute, January 2017 (accessed July 26-27, 2017) At Smith’s urging, we also queried the policy counsel of the National Center for Transgender Equality, which says it’s the "nation’s leading social justice advocacy organization winning life-saving change for transgender people." By email, Ma’ayan Anafi replied that the center considers the 2016 institute estimate to be the most reliable available estimate of the U.S. transgender population. Anafi similarly noted the institute’s estimate for people aged 13-17, adding: "Currently, there is no comprehensive national estimate for the number of transgender people under the age of 13." A Williams Institute researcher Next, we heard back from Andrew Flores, a visiting scholar at the institute involved and familiar with its reports. Flores said that while the research estimates were not independently peer-reviewed prior to publication, both are under consideration by an academic peer-reviewed journal. "We have not seen a methodological challenge or rebuttal," Flores wrote. Also, he said, "we have seen other estimates proposed using the same or similar data." In that vein, Flores provided a web link to the abstract of a study published in the February 2017 American Journal of Public Health containing an extrapolation based on 12 U.S. population surveys taken from 2007 to 2015. Its authors estimated that as of 2016, 390 U.S. adults per 100,000, or almost 1 million adults, identified as transgender. That breaks out to 1.17-in-300 adults. "This estimate," they wrote, "may be more indicative for younger adults, who represented more than 50% of the respondents in our analysis." State estimates by institute We saw that the 2016 institute report had state-by-state estimates of adults identifying as transgender, ranging from 0.3 percent in North Dakota to 0.8 percent in Hawaii--and 0.66 percent in Texas, or 125,350 residents, the report said. The report specified that its estimates were rooted in data from 19 states that opted in to asking participants in the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 2014: "Do you consider yourself to be transgender?" If someone answered affirmatively, he or she was asked: "Do you consider yourself to be male-to-female, female-to-male, or gender non-conforming?" In total, the report says, 0.52 percent of respondents in the 19 states identified as transgender. According to the report, if a respondent asked for a definition of transgender, the person seeking responses was to reply: "Some people describe themselves as transgender when they experience a different gender identify from their sex at birth. For example, a person born into a male body, but who feels female or who lives as a woman would be transgender. Some transgender people change their physical appearance so that it matches their internal gender identity. Some transgender people take hormones and some have surgery. A transgender person may be of any sexual orientation -- straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual." We asked Flores why the institute reached the 0.66 percentage for the nation when responses to the survey question in the 19 states--Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming--supported a lower 0.52 percent result. Flores replied: "While our underlying dataset only contains 19 states, we wanted to make inferences about every state. We did this by running a model that included all respondents, even those who did not get asked about whether or not they identified as transgender. We then used the model results to impute or fill-in whether an individual would identify as transgender considering their state and demographic profile. Finally, we used these results and generalized them to population statistics provided by the Census Bureau. "The reason why the (19-state) survey estimate is lower than the resultant national estimate," Flores wrote, "is mostly due to the demographic composition of the remaining states. As we noted, people of color and younger individuals are more likely to identify as transgender. If a state that was not one of those 19 contains more younger individuals or populations of color, then that would mean then national estimate would be larger as a result." Texas state demographer Next, we asked Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, to review the institute’s 2016 report. Potter said by email that his read suggests that from 0.36 percent to 0.95 percent of the population identifies as transgender, so 1-in-300, or 0.3 percent, "is a little low," he said. Potter explained that institute researchers applied characteristics including race and ethnicity, age cohorts and educational attainment provided by individuals who responded affirmatively to the CDC survey question to produce its estimates of adults in each state who may identify as transgender, with all of the state estimates aggregated to a U.S. estimate.. Potter went on: "It is likely that there is under-reporting among those who do identify as transgender in those 19 states which would suggest the estimate is on the low end." Our ruling Smith said transgender residents make up "about 1-in-300 people, we're all over the place, we're your friends and your neighbors." There’s no direct national count of individuals identifying as transgender but recent analyses rooted in federal survey results support estimates of 1.8-in-300 adults and 2.1-in-300 minors.

pomt-06300	Says 23 percent of ninth graders in Newark will graduate with a high school diploma in four years and "we spend $100,000 on their education in those four years, more than is spent on any other set of students in the United States."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/17/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-graduation-rate-spending-level/	When Gov. Chris Christie discusses his education reform agenda, he talks about Newark’s public schools. In two national speeches on education this year and in a live interview on Facebook on Monday, Christie pushed his proposals for education reform after citing statistics about Newark. "If you look at Newark as an example, for the kids who two months ago entered the ninth grade, in four years 23 percent of them will graduate with a high school diploma and we spend $100,000 on their education in those four years, more than is spent on any other set of students in the United States," Christie said in an interview at Facebook’s headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif. "So what's that tell you? It tells you the model is broken. We have to fix the way we are teaching these children." PolitiFact New Jersey previously checked a similar claim by Christie on Newark’s graduation rate and deemed it False. We’ll review that ruling, then tackle Christie’s claims about per-pupil costs. There are several ways to calculate graduation rates and no solid consensus on whether one method is more credible than any other. The graduation rate Christie references comes from a study by Global Education Advisors, a private consulting firm incorporated by Christopher Cerf before he became New Jersey’s acting state education commissioner. A presentation based on the study’s findings said 22 percent of ninth graders in Newark graduate in four years by passing the High School Proficiency Assessment. But students can graduate through alternate routes, without taking that exam. Newark’s graduation rate for all students who graduate in four years is 55 percent. By not specifying who is included in the graduation rate he cites, Christie omits an entire group of students recognized by the state as having graduated. Now, let’s look at the rest of Christie’s claim. Per-pupil expenditures vary, depending on what’s included in calculating the total and other factors. There’s also no broad consensus on whether one measure is more accurate than any other. The state Education Department developed a new method to calculate per-pupil costs in fiscal year 2011 to account for transportation costs, debt payments and other factors. The new calculation showed Newark spent $22,992 per student for the 2009-2010 school year, or $91,968 for four years. Our analysis of state data found several other districts in New Jersey that exceed Newark’s per-pupil spending. By the new state measurement, Camden spent $23,770 per student; Atlantic City, $24,142; and Asbury Park, $29,819. We also analyzed school district data from the U.S. Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics and found other districts in the United States that spend more than Newark per student. But it’s worth noting that among districts with larger student enrollment, Newark ranks near or at the top in per-pupil spending, depending on the data set. A state Education Department spokesman, citing statistics that put New Jersey at the top nationally in per-pupil spending, said in an e-mail that Christie’s remarks "were based on the fact that NJ has the highest spending in the country, and Newark far exceeds even NJ’s average." Still, Christie said more is spent on students in Newark than on "any other set of students in the United States" and that’s incorrect. Our ruling Christie claimed that 23 percent of ninth graders in Newark will graduate in four years, costing $100,000 per student, more than is spent on any other set of students in the country. Christie’s graduation statistic only includes students who graduate after passing a particular state standardized test and omits a group of students who also graduate in four years through alternate routes. A state measure that includes debt payments and other factors shows Newark spent $22,992 per pupil in the 2009-2010 school year, or $91,968 for four years. But that’s not the highest per-pupil cost in the country. Overall, we rate Christie’s statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12881	Says ICE and border patrol officers "unanimously endorsed me for president."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/26/donald-trump/trump-claims-unanimous-endorsement-ice-border-patr/	On the same day that President Donald Trump signed executive orders to build a border wall and hire more immigration law enforcement officials, he commended employees already serving the country for their service — and for their support. "We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States," Trump said Jan. 25 at the Department of Homeland Security. "Before we go any further, I want to recognize the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and border patrol officers in this room today and to honor their service and not just because they unanimously endorsed me for president. That helps, but that's not the only reason." It was not the first time Trump touted endorsements from immigration officers, but did they unanimously endorse him? Not exactly. Support from ICE, border patrol unions ICE agents are represented by the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, and border patrol officers are represented by the National Border Patrol Council. Both unions endorsed Trump during the presidential campaign. But it is misleading for Trump to say ICE and border patrol officers unanimously endorsed him. The National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council represents 5,000 immigration officers and law enforcement support staff. ICE has about 20,000 employees, including nearly 6,000 agents and officers in removal operations. A statement from the ICE union posted September 2016 on Trump’s presidential campaign website says their endorsement of Trump was the first ever by a vote of the membership. In that same statement, council president Chris Crane said Trump’s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton received 5 percent of that vote. The other union, the National Border Patrol Council, represents 16,500 border patrol agents. The union's endorsement was based on a vote of just 11 leaders of the group, according to the Los Angeles Times. The May 2016 Los Angeles Times article reported that agents in El Paso, Texas, had asked their local union to "disavow the endorsement," but that their attempt failed in a 14-13 vote. Our ruling Trump said ICE and border patrol officers "unanimously endorsed me for president." Unions representing ICE and border patrol agents endorsed Trump for president. Not all officers represented by the ICE union voted to endorse Trump, and some border patrol agents in Texas asked their local union to disavow the national union’s endorsement. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04573	Says scientists predict "sometime in the future, an event that will kill … somewhere between 80 and 90 million people."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/25/john-sharp/john-sharp-says-scientists-agree-future-event-will/	On June 18, 2012, the United States announced a $285 million grant to the Texas A&M University System to create one of three U.S. biosecurity centers. In a speech in Austin that day, system Chancellor John Sharp said the A&M center will be able to quickly make vaccines to respond to a looming threat: "There is going to be, sometime in the future, an event that will kill, according to scientists and with today’s population, somewhere between 80 and 90 million people on this earth." That’s an ominous death toll, and we wondered how sure scientists are that such a devastating outbreak is approaching. When we contacted the A&M System and asked for Sharp’s backup information, spokesman Thomas Graham set up a conference call for us with Scott Lillibridge, the deputy principal investigator for A&M’s Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, who is a professor of epidemiology at the Texas A&M Health Science Center and former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s bioterrorism program. Lillibridge defined pandemic for us: an event in which multiple epidemics break out around the globe at the same time. "It’s certain that we’ll have another pandemic sometime," he said. "And we just don’t know when or how serious it will be." Others agree. We reviewed news stories and spoke by phone and email with Kumanan Wilson of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, author of a February 2012 article on estimating flu pandemic deaths in the European Journal of Public Health, and University of Texas professor of biology and statistics Lauren Meyers. Meyers told us, "I would say it’s a certainty we will get new strains of virus flu that emerge in human populations and cause widespread illness." Wilson said, "The consensus is yes, there will be regular pandemics." In a Sept. 19, 2011, news story on a conference of the European Scientific Working Group on Influenza, Scientific American quoted University of Virginia School of Medicine professor Frederick Hayden: "What is clear is that (the next flu pandemic) is when, not if." The story described his statement as "one of many proclamations of coming plague during the meeting that was tinged with just enough urgency to generate attention (and research funding) but not ignite an all-out panic." The World Health Organization’s most recent Global Vaccine Action Plan referred to preparing for "the next pandemic," though noting that it’s "impossible to predict the exact timing or nature of a future pandemic." "In an influenza pandemic, most of the world’s population will be highly susceptible to the virus infection and it is conceivable that the virus will spread rapidly," the 2006 plan said. "At the present time, if an influenza pandemic were to occur, the potential vaccine supply would fall several billion doses short of the amount needed to provide protection to the global population." The plan’s executive summary concludes, "Action must start now – this fact cannot be emphasized strongly enough – action must start now if the world is to prepare itself in the shortest possible time for a potential influenza pandemic." WHO is working on an updated plan, according to its web site. That degree of preparation, experts told us, is one of the largest elements in determining how many people will die. Other factors include how the contagion spreads, how quickly it kills, how early it’s detected and how coordinated the medical response is. But preparation is essential because once a major outbreak begins, there’s no time to manufacture enough of the right vaccine. Each flu season, Lillibridge said, the CDC and counterparts around the world track fast-changing viruses to predict which vaccines will be most needed. CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told us by phone that once the prediction is made, the CDC sends a "seed" virus to vaccine manufacturers. It takes five months to produce and ship the vaccines, he said. Technology, communication and distribution give today’s medics a huge advantage over those who faced the 1918-19 "Spanish flu" pandemic, the event both Sharp and Lillibridge used to frame the current threat. That global outbreak was "the mother of them all," said a Nov. 26, 2007, Guardian (UK) news story that listed the death tolls for the 20th century’s three flu pandemics: "The 1968-69 Hong Kong flu killed up to a million people globally, the 1957-58 Asian flu killed up to 1.5 million" and the Spanish flu killed "around 40 million" -- more than World War I, the story said. All were caused, according to a June 22, 2012, Bloomberg news story, by flu viruses that started with animals, mixed with human flu and then mutated into new strains that humans weren’t immune to. So was 2009’s pandemic of H1N1 "swine flu," which according to the World Health Organization proved less deadly than had been feared, killing about 16,000 people worldwide. Through "pure good luck," said an Aug. 10, 2010, WHO report, the mutating virus didn’t develop resistance to the vaccine or change into a more deadly form. As to the estimated death toll of a future pandemic, Lillibridge told us, "The chancellor is right in the ballpark." Later, through an A&M center spokeswoman, Lillibridge said that if a virus as deadly as the 1918 strain broke out, "assuming the same mortality rate today, and a world population of 6.9 billion, that is about 193 million deaths." Meyer agreed that the range Sharp gave, 80 million to 90 million deaths, is plausible, noting that the Spanish flu might have killed that many even with the world’s much smaller population at the time. "But if and when we get one as deadly as 1918, I think there’s quite a bit of uncertainty," she said. However, Wilson expressed skepticism as to the 80 million to 90 million range: "Officials said the same this time around (the 2009 pandemic) with the most conservative estimates being grossly higher than the actual death toll." Wilson’s article in the February 2012 issue of the European Journal of Public Health rounded up several of those estimates: A Dec. 8, 2004, WHO "best case" scenario of 2 million to 7 million deaths. A Dec. 23, 2006, article in The Lancet saying that if a flu strain like the 1918-19 virus had emerged in 2004, it could have killed 51 million to 81 million people. A May 5, 2005, article in the New England Journal of Medicine saying that an H5N1 "bird flu" pandemic could be as deadly as the Spanish flu and, based on the change in world population, could kill 180 million to 360 million. Our ruling Sharp said scientists predict "sometime in the future, an event that will kill … somewhere between 80 and 90 million people." Scientists agree another pandemic is coming.

pomt-04102	The fiscal cliff deal "increased spending."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/15/tom-price/claim-spending-rose-under-fiscal-cliff-deal-misses/	As the nation gears up for more debates on the budget, we here at PolitiFact Georgia figure we’d better sort out what happened during the last one. Thanks to the fiscal cliff deal passed by Congress on New Year’s Day, a series of automatic spending cuts and tax hikes designed to pressure legislators into acting on the federal budget won’t go into effect until March. Lawmakers may have agreed to pass the the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, but they don’t agree on what it did. Some supporters said the deal cut spending. But U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Roswell Republican, begged to differ. "My assessment was that it ultimately raised taxes and didn’t decrease any spending. In fact, it increased spending," Price said during a Jan. 2 interview on WMAL-FM, a Washington-area radio station. He voted against the deal. So which one is it? A spending increase or cut? A prior PolitiFact check addressed Price’s claim on taxes and found it was Half True. It’s valid to see the deal as a tax cut or an increase. Thanks to the deal, our taxes are lower than if Congress allowed the nation to fall off the fiscal cliff and stay there. But we’re paying more taxes than we did in 2012. So, we wondered, is the deal’s impact on spending a matter of perspective as well? For the most part, yes. Compared with what would have happened without a deal, it’s a spending increase. As we mentioned before, the old statute required automatic spending cuts on Jan. 1. If this law stayed in place, outlays would have totaled nearly $47. 4 trillion over 10 years, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which measures the impact of legislation on the budget. Passage of the deal pushed the CBO’s estimate to more than $47.7 trillion, a spending boost of about $330 billion. But compared with what the federal government spent in 2012, the deal is a cut, CBO figures show. The agency calculated spending changes based on an "alternative fiscal scenario" in which 2013 outlays would have stayed roughly the same as they were in 2012. Using this baseline, spending would have topped $50 trillion through 2022. Spending under the deal is about $2.3 trillion lower. Now here’s where things get complicated. Even when analysts use the same baseline, estimates on the deal’s spending impact can vary by tens of billions of dollars. Consider estimates by the conservative Heritage Foundation and the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. They compared spending under the fiscal cliff deal with the former law. As we said above, the fiscal cliff deal is a spending increase if you use this baseline. The Heritage Foundation found that the deal increased spending by $47 billion over 10 years. This is proof that Congress has not gotten serious about cutting the budget, said Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow in federal budgetary affairs at the think tank. "As dollar amounts go, it’s not a very large amount," Knudsen said. "But as a matter of principle it is." On the other hand, the CBPP estimates that the increase is closer to $3 billion over 10 years. The group concluded it was not a significant increase. Analyses differ because they tally certain spending line items differently. But in the world of trillion-dollar federal budgets, this $44 billion gap is not a major one. "With so much money being spent, whether spending goes up by $3 billion or $47 billion is a rounding error," said Howard Gleckman, an Urban Institute budget expert. "We will never know who is right. I just say the deal barely changed spending from CBO's projections." One last thing. As we mentioned in our prior fact check on the tax portion of Price’s claim, the trick is to make sure you don’t mix up your baselines. If your analysis compares current spending with expenditures in 2012, use the same baseline for taxes as well, experts told us. Price runs into trouble on this front. His conclusion that taxes rose is valid compared with the amount paid in 2012. But from this perspective, spending is actually down. Once again, we come to the conclusion that Price is both right and wrong. If Congress had failed to change the law in 2012 that sent the country off the fiscal cliff, federal spending would be lower than it is now. But if spending had stayed at 2012 levels, it would be higher. Price’s claim on spending is technically accurate. But he leaves out critical information. And he mixes his budget baselines to make a point. In our book, that’s a Half True.	None	Tom Price	None	None	None	2013-01-15T06:00:00	2013-01-02	['None']
pomt-12273	7 million people the Congressional Budget Office says won't have health insurance coverage under the Senate health care bill "don't exist."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/05/marc-short/cbo-counted-7-million-people-who-dont-exist-says-w/	The White House says the Congressional Budget Office shouldn’t be trusted to predict the impact of efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. Want evidence? White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short said recently that the CBO is counting millions of nonexistent people in its estimate of the number of Americans who stand to lose insurance coverage under the Senate’s proposed health care bill. The CBO, in its June 26 report, estimated that health insurance coverage would go down by 22 million by 2026 if the Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 becomes law. Short, in an appearance on Fox News Sunday July 2, attacked the CBO’s credibility, saying that of that 22 million, 7 million actually "don’t exist." "When the press reports that 22 million people are going to lose coverage, it's a ridiculous number," Short said. "Seven million of those people are people that don't exist," he added soon after. "They’re people that is based upon a baseline that CBO put out in 2014, even though the actual number is way down here." Short’s claim is a variation on a recent Republican talking point: The CBO report did not use its most recent baseline estimates when scoring the Senate health care bill. (The "baseline" is what CBO predicts will happen if current law remains unchanged.) So the 22-million drop in coverage is based on out-of-date data, Republicans say. Is Short right? We found that he has a point. By picking one baseline over another, the CBO may have altered an estimate of the people who would no longer be covered by health insurance. But Short’s specific figure and his description are imperfect. Baselining the CBO’s baseline The CBO report about the Senate bill used baseline figures about health care coverage calculated in March 2016, even though it updated those figures in January 2017. (Short wrongly said the report was based on a 2014 baseline.) What difference do those 10 months between March 2016 and January 2017 make? The CBO’s March 2016 baseline had significantly higher estimates for how many people will have insurance purchased through the Obamacare marketplaces than its 2017 calculation. Short was specifically highlighting a 7 million difference in the projections for 2018. In its March 2016 baseline, CBO projected that under current law, 18 million people would have Obamacare marketplace insurance coverage in 2018. Under the updated January 2017 baseline, however, that figure for the same year dropped to 11 million. It’s reasonable to say the differences between the 2016 and 2017 baseline estimates are significant enough that had the CBO used the newer baseline, its score of the Senate health care bill might have been different. And — this is Short’s larger point — it’s plausible that had CBO used the newer baseline, it would have a lower estimate than 22 million for the total drop in coverage by 2026 because fewer people may have had insurance to start with, meaning the people who could potentially lose coverage would be smaller. But it wouldn’t necessarily be 7 million fewer, as Short’s statement implied. It’s a mistake to equate projections for marketplace coverage under current law with the potential impact of the Senate health care bill on that enrollment, experts told us. "Short is correct that the numbers might look more favorable for the bill if the CBO had used the most recent baseline available, but it isn't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison," said Timothy Callaghan, a health policy professor at Texas A&M University. Medicaid losses, CBO reasoning Experts also told us that Short’s claim is misleading because even if CBO used the newer baseline to score the Senate health bill, insurance coverage would still drop by many millions. It also ignores the fact that the majority of coverage loss under the Senate bill would be due to changes in Medicaid, the government health insurance program for poor Americans that Obamacare expanded. CBO predicted that Medicaid coverage would go down by 15 million, while Obamacare marketplace coverage would go down by 7 million. (Table 4) "(CBO) did significantly overestimate how many people would sign up for the exchanges," said Benjamin Sommers, a health policy professor at Harvard University. "But that’s only one part of CBO's broader set of ACA projections. They were much more accurate about Medicaid enrollment and the total effect on the uninsured population." We should note that the CBO report said the analysts decided to use the March 2016 baseline instead of the 2017 based on its consultations with the congressional budget committees. "If Congressional Republicans really wanted CBO to use the January 2017 baseline, they could absolutely direct CBO to do that," said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy at the Brookings Institution and former chief economist on President Barack Obama’s Council on Economic Advisers. Our ruling Short said that 7 million people the Congressional Budget Office says won't have health insurance coverage under the Senate health care bill "don't exist." It is plausible that CBO overestimated the drop in health care coverage under the Senate replacement for Obamacare because it based its estimates on data from 2016 rather than 2017. But the thought process that led Short to say the projection was off by 7 million is an oversimplification. Until CBO redoes its analysis with the more recent data, we may not know how exactly its projections change. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-09037	Texas state Reps. Dan Branch and Jim Pitts, lieutenants to House Speaker Joe Straus, “are helping Democrat Ellen Cohen against her Republican challenger, doing events with her in her district.”	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/05/david-barton/barton-says-two-gop-house-chairs-did-events-helpin/	In a letter distributed June 12 to delegates to the Republican Party of Texas state convention, David Barton of Aledo depicts allies of Joe Straus of San Antonio, the GOP speaker of the Texas House, as too likely to help Democrats. Among nearly 20 points he raises: “Straus lieutenants (Reps.) Dan Branch and Jim Pitts are helping Ellen Cohen against her Republican challenger, doing events with her in her district.” Background: Branch and Pitts, supporters of Straus for speaker, were appointed by him to chair major committees. To back his Branch charge, Barton pointed us to 25 photos posted online in March by Cohen, a Houston Democrat. The photos, arrayed under the header “Higher Education Forum,” include a shot of Branch, R-Dallas, standing at a lectern in front of a slide headlined “Planning For A Budget Shortfall.” Barton later elaborated in an e-mail: “It is not (standard operating procedure) to do such events in settings in which Republicans help make a single Democrat look favorable to her constituents -- especially when it is in the midst of the campaign cycle rather than the policy/legislative cycle.” Branch and Cohen each told us that Cohen, a member of the House Higher Education Committee, invited Branch, the committee chair, to speak to residents at a public forum on Feb. 25. Branch said whenever a member of the higher education committee extends such an invitation, he’s got to give it consideration, and that he and Cohen took pains to keep the forum non-political. “I told her I didn’t think it would be helpful to do it once the general election process was in place,” said Branch. The forum took place before Cohen’s Republican opponent, Sarah Davis, was nominated in the March 2 primary. “Most Republicans who understand the facts will realize I did the right thing,” Branch said. He also said he has not endorsed Cohen: “I have not campaigned for her, I have not given her a contribution.” What of Republican Pitts helping Cohen? Barton pointed us to a Web post by Cohen’s campaign inviting visitors to a 90-minute “Appropriations Forum” on May 6 featuring Pitts, R-Waxahachie, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, on which Cohen sits. Cohen writes in the Pitts-related post: “I respect Chairman Pitts’ leadership and value his insights as we are face critical days of current cuts and budget shortfalls. I appreciate his willingness to travel to Houston and be a part of this forum.” Pitts told us he might have erred by agreeing to speak at the forum in an election year. “I didn’t go there to help Ellen, that wasn’t the purpose. But I learned my lesson. I am going to be very careful. My timing probably should be before a primary, or even before people file” their candidacies in December and early January before the primaries. Pitts said Davis’s husband approached him after he spoke to question his remark that “Ellen and I have our hands full next session”-- implying Pitts expects Cohen to win re-election. “I did say that; I guess I’m guilty,” Pitts said. Kent Adams, the GOP nominee’s husband, later told us he took note of Cohen campaign signs outside the Pitts’ engagement and campaign literature at the Branch event. Tammi Wallace, Cohen’s chief of staff, said the signs were put up so audience members could find their way in. Adams said Cohen campaign workers and campaign literature were at both events. Wallace said there was no literature as such, though campaign-funded constituent survey cards were put out and Cohen campaign staff members attended the forums “because the campaign staff is expected to pitch in and do whatever they need to do to help out.” Would Pitts accept invitations to speak at forums hosted by Democratic House incumbents facing Republican challengers this November? “I would pass,” Pitts said. “I don’t want to send the wrong signal. I would go any place (to speak) but I don’t want to do it with a Democrat and I’m not going to do it for any Republican against an incumbent Democrat.” His rationale: He’ll need the support of members of both parties to advance the next state budget. “We’ve got to pass a bill,” Pitts said. Are Branch and Pitts “helping” Cohen against her GOP opponent by speaking to her constituents, as Barton claims? Adams, Davis’s husband/campaign manager, said that Cohen obviously intended for the GOP speakers to boost her campaign, but few people turned out for Branch, he said, and tax talk at Pitts’ stop was off-putting. “They were inconsequential,” he said. For her part, Cohen characterized the appearances by Pitts and Branch as informational instead of political. “The story to me is the fact that two Republican chairs of committees I serve on willingly agreed to come in and educate my district,” she said. What we find: Barton’s statement accurately refers to the GOP House members appearing at events with Cohen at her invitation, in her district. But the two forums weren’t political rallies--and even her opponent’s campaign manager saw no boon for Cohen. We rate Barton’s statement Half True.

pomt-03510	"During the Civil War, more than 300,000 Ohioans served in the Union Army -- more per capita than any other state."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/05/keith-faber/senate-president-keith-faber-says-more-300000-ohio/	Ohio honors citizens who give their lives in military service for their country with the Ohio Military Medal of Distinction. The medals are presented to family members of fallen service members during a joint session of the General Assembly. The day also includes a memorial program that includes remarks from the governor and a wreath laying ceremony. On May 21, 2013, the General Assembly presented medals to families of 16 fallen service members. In his remarks, Senate President Keith Faber noted that Ohioans have always served on the front lines "to preserve and protect our freedoms." He particularly noted Ohio’s service during the American Civil War. "During the Civil War, more than 300,000 Ohioans served in the Union Army, more per capita than any other state." PolitiFact Ohio knew that Ohio has a deep history of service in the Civil War, and asked Faber for support of his claim. His staff referred us to data from the Ohio Historical Society, a nonprofit organization, partially funded by the state, that champions and preserves Ohio history. It maintains, by law, the state archives of Ohio. As part of its commemoration of the sesquicentennial of the Civil War, the historical society published an article that discussed Ohio’s war effort. "Although most of the American Civil War was fought outside of Ohio’s borders, the Buckeye State played a huge role in determining the outcome," the article notes. "Between 319,000 and 330,000 Ohioans served in the Northern army for varying lengths of time." The level of recruits, according to the Historical Society, was more per capita than any other state. "Three out of every five Ohio men between the ages of 18 and 45 served at various times in the Union Army and Navy during the Civil War. Ohio men fought in every major battle of the war." In all, almost 3 million men served in the Union army during what remains the bloodiest military conflict in American history, according to the U.S. Army Center of Military History. Nearly 360,000 federal troops were killed during the war. About 160,000 Confederate soldiers perished. PolitiFact Ohio checked the historical society’s Civil War pages and found other notable points from Ohio’s role in the Civil War: When President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 recruits in April 1861, Ohio's quota was 13,000. Sixteen days after Lincoln’s call for troops, enough Ohioans had volunteered to meet the full national requirement. More than 100,200 men enlisted that year. The more than 300,000 Ohioans who served in war represent the third largest total from any Union State. (In the 1860 Census, Ohio was the third most populous state, behind New York and Pennsylvania, which were Nos. 1 and 2 for providing troops.) Among those who served from Ohio, more than 200 reached the rank of general, including several Confederate generals. Five veterans of the war with links to Ohio became president. The state lays partial claim to Ulysses Grant, who was elected from Illinois, and Benjamin Harrison, who was elected from Indiana. They were both born in Ohio. Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield and William McKinley all served with Ohio units and were elected president as Ohioans. Faber’s claim was that more than 300,000 Ohioans served in the Civil War and that the per capita enlistment was the highest in the nation. The Ohio Historical Society, the state’s official archive, backs his claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.

pomt-15366	After actions by Gov. Scott Walker and Republicans, Wisconsin "is dead broke."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/06/occupy-democrats/occupy-democrats-group-says-wisconsin-dead-broke-d/	A Facebook meme posted by a liberal Democratic group puts a new twist on an old claim that the state of Wisconsin is "broke." The post by Occupy Democrats includes a photo of Republican Gov. Scott Walker and this statement: "Last year, Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed a $541 million tax cut for millionaires and corporations. Today, Wisconsin’s budget is $283 million in the red, funding for education is being slashed, government programs are being gutted, and the state is about to miss a $108 million debt payment -- because it is dead broke." In the comments below the meme, the group posted: "Governor Scott Walker is committing political malpractice against the people of Wisconsin." Readers are directed to a Feb. 18, 2015 Washington Post story that looks at the state’s finances. Occupy Democrats was founded by Omar Rivero, an unsuccessful 2014 Democratic nominee for the Florida state House. The group frequently posts provocative memes that draw considerable attention. The March 15, 2015 "dead broke" post continues to make the rounds and had been shared more than 18,000 times as of July 1, 2015. The group did not respond to an email asking for backup for the claim. The claim Wisconsin is "broke" is familiar -- though in the past we have heard it from the other side of the aisle. Walker and other Republicans have used it to describe the condition of the state’s finances when they took office in 2011. When we reviewed those claims -- from Walker in 2011 and Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke in June of 2015 -- we rated them False. The state wasn’t out of money and its financial condition didn’t match the definition of "broke," which suggests at or near bankruptcy. What’s more, the state had numerous tools available to deal with any shortfall -- even if some of the options, such as tax increases, were declared off limits by Walker and Republicans. So what about the Occupy Democrats claim that various actions by Walker have left the state "dead broke"? Behind the claim Before the group gets to its central point, it lays out a list of assertions that amount to its evidence. Some of them -- education being "slashed" and government programs "gutted" -- are offered without specifics. In the cases where details are provided, the picture is not always so clean. Take the tax cut. Walker did sign a $541 million tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature on March 24, 2014. The package cut property and income taxes for families and businesses, and zeroed out all income taxes for Wisconsin manufacturers. It also reduced the amount of state taxes withheld from workers’ paychecks. Thus, the package wasn’t directed exclusively at "millionaires and corporations," as Occupy Democrats claimed. Citing a memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick noted "the largest percentage of tax reductions went to those making between $15,000 and $20,000." At the time the 2014 tax cut was approved, projections showed that the state was on track to have a $1 billion budget surplus in June 2015. Times changed, and so do budget projections. In November 2014, the Walker administration said that surplus had melted into a $132 million shortfall. In January 2015, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau said the shortfall was $283 million because tax collections were $173 million lower than expected. To close the gap, in February 2015, Walker's administration said it would skip $108 million in debt payments in May 2015. That, too, was cited as evidence of being broke by Occupy Democrats. Other steps were taken as well, including refinancing of state debt. At the time, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau said under the move the state would only pay the interest on certain obligations. Such a delay is allowed under terms of the borrowing, an administration spokesman said. However, taxpayers would need to make higher principal and interest payments in the future, starting with an additional $19.3 million in the two-year budget that began July 1, 2015. But this deferral strategy is nothing new. It has been employed for years by Walker and previous governors, including his predecessor Democrat Jim Doyle. It’s even got a nickname: "Scoop and toss" -- as in scoop up the debt and toss it into the future for others to address. So, while it’s true that Walker skipped a payment, it’s a financing move that’s not unusual, and not an indication of bankruptcy or similar financial calamity. Indeed, the move helped bring the 2013-15 budget into balance. That points us back to the group’s "dead broke" claim. In our earlier items, we noted that dictionaries define "broke" as "having no money; bankrupt" and "without money; penniless." But the state is still paying its bills and there has been no indication that it's on the brink of bankruptcy or insolvency. Further, under federal law, the state is not allowed to make such a declaration. Said Patrick: "There is no imbalance and Wisconsin is not ‘dead broke.’ " Some may find such a statement from Walker’s office ironic. But that does not mean it is inaccurate. Our rating In a Facebook meme, the group Occupy Democrats says Wisconsin is "dead broke" because of various actions by Walker and Republicans. Yes, there were tax cuts, and cuts to many programs along the way. All are evidence of changing policy priorities, with Republicans in charge. But they are not evidence the state is "dead broke." What’s more, this claim has been rated False enough times that to keep making pushes it to ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-01226	The Orange County, Florida, school board "voted to make it impossible for a student to receive a grade below 50."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/nov/20/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-orange-county-schools-made-it-imposs/	Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in a speech that we shouldn’t worry so much about students’ self-esteem when it comes to setting grades. And he wagged his finger at Orange County, Florida. "This morning, over 213 million Chinese students went to school and nobody debated whether academic expectations should be lowered in order to protect their students’ self esteem," he said in his keynote to the National Summit on Education Reform on Nov. 20, 2014. "Yet in Orange County, Fla., last week I read that debate actually did occur at a school board meeting. The school board voted to make it impossible for a student to receive a grade below 50. You get 50 out of 100 just for showing up and signing your name. This was done -- and I quote here from a local official -- ‘so that the students do not lose all hope.’ " Bush went on to cite statistics that showed students in Shanghai far outranking their peers in the United States in reading and math. "An overriding concern for self-esteem instead of high expectations does not get you to No. 1," he said. "It gets you to No. 21." So is 50 the new zero in Orange County schools? We went in search of answers. Orange County On Nov. 11, the Orange County school board took a vote on grading policies for middle and high school students that has received widespread attention. The vote was part of changes to the district’s "student progression plan," which outlines instructional goals and policies for the year. One piece of that plan related to a new grading policy. Superintendent Barbara Jenkins told the board that one provision would ban grades lower than a 50 when grades for the nine-week quarter or semester are determined. However, grades below a 50 would still be possible on individual assignments. In other words, students could still get lower than a 50 on a specific test, but no longer for the entire grading period. The district already started the policy last year; the purpose of the board’s vote was to codify the practice. The goal is to give students some hope that if they are failing early in the year, they can catch up and ultimately pass the class. Last year, 43 percent of students in the county who got an "F" the first quarter ended up failing the class. However the remainder of students were able to recover, with the majority getting a "D." "It is still very difficult for children to recover if that nine-week grade is an F," Jenkins told the school board. "However, stopping them at 50 does not bury them so deep that they lose all hope and have no reason to continue for the rest of year." Some teachers told the school board they opposed the policy. "Are we really helping students by inflating grades, or are we harming them?" asked high school teacher Wendy Doromal. "I say we are harming them by conditioning them to think they can skate by with little effort." Most of the board members supported the plan as a way to give students one last chance to pull their grades out of a failing mark. "It’s just to help kids dig themselves out of a hole," school board member Daryl Flynn said. The school board voted in favor of the plan, 7-1, with member Rick Roach dissenting. (Board chair Bill Sublette said he opposed the 50 percent rule, however he said was voting "yes" for the overall plan which included several policies related to student assessment.) Orange County school officials determined that their grading plan follows state law -- however the state Department of Education hasn’t weighed in on whether it agress with that assessment. However, the state’s public schools chancellor wrote a memo to superintendents in 2009 raising concerns that some were not using the 0-59 scale set in state law. Florida statute sets grade ranges as follows: 90 – 100 = A 80 – 89 = B 70 – 79 = C 60 – 69 = D 0 – 59 = Failure Many districts, including Miami-Dade, Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas, follow those guidelines and haven’t added any rules setting 50 as a minimum standard for report cards. "We give kids the grade they earn," Hillsborough spokesman Stephen Hegarty told PolitiFact. "If it's below 50, then you get a 30 or a zero, or whatever score you earn." The topic of setting a minimum number for an "F" grade has been hotly contested nationwide, including in New York, Oregon and Texas. After a Texas school district proposed a minimum F grade, the state Legislature passed a Truth-In-Grading law. A judge upheld the law in 2010, ruling against school districts that argued they could require teachers to give minimum grades such as a 50 on report cards. Experts weigh in Is what Orange County’s doing tantamount to grade inflation? Not necessarily. The main concern about grade inflation hasn’t been about making F students into D students -- it has been about making A the most common grade in high schools and colleges, said Stuart Rojstaczer, a former Duke University geology professor who has done research on grading. "The impact of even a nationwide policy of ‘no less than 50’ on GPAs would be tiny," he told PolitiFact. "We're taking Joe and Jane Averages and making their parents believe they are Joe and Jane Geniuses. The Joe and Jane Flunkers are still flunking out of school." As for Bush’s statement, Rojstaczer said "A ‘no less than 50’ policy isn't about self esteem. It's about trying to make it possible for a small percentage of students to barely cross over the bar and graduate." Thomas Guskey, a University of Kentucky Education professor, made the case against percentage grades in a 2013 article in Educational Leadership, a publication of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. Guskey wrote that "although some have suggested minimum grade policies promote grade inflation and social promotion in schools, well-designed, longitudinal studies show this is not the case," he wrote. "Rather, school districts implement minimum-grade policies simply to eliminate the confounding effects of a zero in a percentage grading system." Our ruling Bush said that the Orange County school board "voted to make it impossible for a student to receive a grade below 50. You get 50 out of 100 just for showing up and signing your name." The school board voted that 50 is the minimum number for quarter and semester grades, though it’s still possible to get a lower grade on an individual assignment or test.

Mitt Romney questions Perry’s proclaimed record creating jobs in the Lone Star State by hammering the number of unemployed Texans and changes in the Texas unemployment rate. Whoa, Mitty! The Texas economy has been roaring since about 1990. Pia Orrenius, a senior economist for the Federal Reserve branch in Dallas, told us this year that some of the favorable economic factors in Texas are its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China. Orrenius also ranks among experts who have told us that job gains and losses in a state aren’t controlled by whoever is governor. Orrenius said in June: "Long before Rick Perry" became governor, "we were talking about the great Texas economy. There are so many exciting things about the Texas economy that precede any political flavor of the month." In this story, we’re checking five claims in Romney’s multi-barreled Oct. 26, 2011, press release. It says that more than 1 million Texans are out of work and that the state’s unemployment rate has doubled on Perry’s watch and is at its highest level in nearly 25 years. Also, the Texas rate is higher than the rates in 27 states, the email says, and has escalated faster than the national rate during Barack Obama’s presidency. 1) Romney’s spokeswoman, Gail Gitcho, says in the press release that "more than a million workers in (Perry’s) state are out of a job." Information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier helped us confirm that 1.04 million Texans were unemployed as of August 2011. There were slightly more unemployed Texans as of September, the bureau says. 2) From the Romney release: "The unemployment rate in Texas is 8.5 percent, more than twice as high as when Perry took office." The unemployment rate has doubled during Perry’s governorship — going from 4.2 percent in December 2000 to 8.5 percent in September 2011, according to BLS data. 3) Romney’s release says the "unemployment rate in Texas is at a level not seen in nearly a quarter of a century." That’s also correct, per the bureau: The state’s September unemployment rate, 8.5 percent, was the highest Texas had experienced since the 9.3 percent rate reached in November 1986, nearly 25 years before. 4) The email also says that in September, "27 states had a lower unemployment rate than Texas." That’s correct, according to the bureau’s state-by-state breakdown of September unemployment rates. 5) The email blast also says that since Obama became president, in January 2009, the Texas "unemployment rate has grown nearly twice as fast as the national rate." That claim was new fodder for the PolitiFact Texas Truth-O-Meter. Romney says that between January 2009 and September 2011, the national unemployment rate grew by 16.7 percent, increasing from 7.8 percent to 9.1 percent. Over the same period, the email says, the unemployment rate in Texas grew from 6.4 percent to 8.5 percent — a 32.8 percent increase. According to BLS data, the unemployment rate figures for both Texas and the nation are correct. In a telephone interview, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, said the Texas unemployment rate has grown faster than the national one since January 2009. She suggested another way of measuring the changes; the U.S. rate rose 1.3 percentage points between January 2009 and September 2011 while the Texas rate increased 2.1 points. Then again, Abbot pointed out, the Texas’ unemployment rate remains below the national one. Abbot also suggested that we look at the change in the raw number of unemployed workers in both the U.S. and Texas. We found that those numbers also largely support Romney’s point that unemployment has been growing faster in Texas since January 2009 than it has across the country. The number of unemployed people nationally rose 16.8 percent between January 2009 and September 2011 while the number in Texas increased 38 percent. We took one other dip into the numbers, this time thinking about timing. During many fact-checks of jobs-related claims, we’ve learned that changing the time period in a comparison can result in big differences in the numbers. Romney’s statement considers the increase in unemployment since Obama entered office in January 2009, about a year after the national recession began and after the U.S. and Texas jobless rates had both begun to climb. Unlike the Texas unemployment rate, though, the U.S. rate has been on a generally downward trend from its latest peak of 10.1 percent in October 2009. Rolling back the starting month of Romney’s comparison to November 2007, the month before the recession began, narrowly causes the difference between Texas and the nation to flip. From November 2007 to September 2011, the U.S. unemployment rate rose 4.4 percentage points, an increase in the rate of 94 percent. In the period, the Texas unemployment rate increased by a smaller 4.1 percentage points, up 93 percent. Choosing yet another time period, one starting in January 2006, the Texas performance seems even better, relative to the nation. Between January 2006 and September 2011, the U.S. unemployment rate rose faster than the Texas one: 4.4 percentage points vs. 3.4 points. Our ruling Each of Romney’s Texas-tied jobless claims is factually supported, yet his claims fuel a misleading impression — that the Texas governor has guided its economy into a ditch. To the contrary, the Texas economy has fared relatively well for more than 20 years. Besides, it’s unreasonable to blame, or credit, a state’s governor for changes in unemployment rates. A single state official, even the governor, doesn’t hold sway over the many factors that drive the economy. . We rate Romney’s response to Perry’s ad as Half True.

pomt-03790	"While the United States has seen its unemployment rate steadily decline, New Jersey's remains nearly two percent higher than the national average and more than a point higher than Connecticut and New York."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/mar/28/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-new-jersey-unemployment-ranks/	There may be various theories about New Jersey’s improving economic climate, but for Barbara Buono, the state’s unemployment rate is the real story. Unemployment nationwide and in neighboring states seems to be improving, so why is New Jersey’s unemployment rate stagnant, Buono asked recently. "While the United States has seen its unemployment rate steadily decline, New Jersey’s remains nearly two percent higher than the national average and more than a point higher than Connecticut and New York, " she said in response to a state Labor Department employment report released March 18. There are differing opinions about how unemployment should be measured but based strictly on the unemployment rate, Buono’s three points appear to be valid. Before reviewing the three elements of Buono’s statement, let’s define some important details. First, we need to know how to measure unemployment. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics spokeswoman Stacey Standish said it’s best to look at the unemployment rate versus the number of jobs because the rate takes population into account. A disproportion becomes evident when citing geographically different areas because the number of jobs lost is going to be higher in the area with a denser population, she said. "The unemployment rate is a better measure," Standish said. Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for Gov. Chris Christie, disputed the value of comparing rates. He said the state looks at a business survey to get a broader picture of unemployment, while the BLS uses a monthly household survey to assess unemployment and determine the rate. "What jobs were added, where were jobs added, in what sectors," Roberts said about the business survey. "You can drill down and get a much better composite picture of what’s happening in the state, rather than the unemployment rate." Now let’s look at Buono’s statement. The national unemployment rate was 9.8 percent in February 2010. It briefly climbed to 9.9 percent but then trended downward, lingering at 9 percent for six months of 2011. By February of this year it had fallen to 7.7 percent. So Buono is right that the U.S. unemployment rate has declined steadily. Next, is New Jersey’s unemployment rate nearly 2 percent higher than the nation’s? It is, but only since about July 2012, according to BLS data. Finally, how does New Jersey’s unemployment rate stack up against Connecticut’s and New York’s? Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner said Buono’s remarks cover the timeframe that Christie has been in office. Accordingly, we reviewed BLS data going back to February 2010 – Christie’s first full month in office. BLS data shows that New Jersey’s unemployment rate was at least 1 percent higher than Connecticut’s rate throughout 2012 and this past January. New Jersey’s unemployment rate was 1 percent higher than New York’s for a 22-month period from February 2010 to this past January. Here’s a breakdown of unemployment rates for the three states: New Jersey’s rate was 9.7 percent in February 2010 and 9.5 percent this past January. Connecticut’s was 9.2 percent in February 2010 and 8.1 percent in January. New York’s was 8.1 percent in February 2010 and 8.4 percent in January. Our ruling In response to unemployment numbers released in January by the state Department of Labor, Buono said, "While the United States has seen its unemployment rate steadily decline, New Jersey’s remains nearly two percent higher than the national average and more than a point higher than Connecticut and New York." Buono has varying degrees of accuracy on her three points, looking strictly at unemployment rate: the national unemployment rate has declined steadily while Christie’s been governor; the country’s unemployment rate has been nearly 2 percent below New Jersey’s, but only for about six months; and New Jersey’s unemployment rate has been more than 1 percent higher than New York’s and Connecticut’s for the bulk of the time Christie has been in office. Given the varying degrees of accuracy, as well as the state measuring unemployment differently from the BLS, we rate Buono’s claim Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05162	"When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts ... (had) more debt per person than any other state in the country."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-mitt-romney-was-no-1-state-de/	In the newest installment of a continuing attack on Mitt Romney’s record as governor of Massachusetts, an ad from the Obama campaign takes aim at the Bay State’s debt load. The ad, released June 12, 2012, has the ironic title "Number One," claiming that "when Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts ... (had) more debt per person than any other state in the country." First, here's a primer on state debt and how it differs from the national debt. Because the United States is a sovereign nation that can print its own money, it is able to run annual operating deficits -- that is, an annual shortfall of revenues compared to outlays. The accumulation of all past deficits, minus past surpluses, produces the national debt. States, by contrast, can’t print their own money, so most of them -- including Massachusetts -- require a balanced budget. States can, however, borrow money in order to fund capital improvements -- everything from new roads to new school buildings. That’s the debt we’re talking about here. We'll also note that despite its heavy debt burden, Massachusetts has remained highly creditworthy. Beginning in January 2000, Massachusetts’ credit rating according to Moody’s has been Aa2, the third-highest category, just behind Aaa and Aa1. In 2010, the ratings were recalibrated for all states, and while Massachusetts creditworthiness didn’t change, the name of its rating was changed to Aa1 -- the second-highest category for states. (Here’s the full list of ratings, down to C.) Looking at the numbers The ad attributes the statistic to a report by the credit-rating agency Moody’s. The report -- "2007 State Debt Medians" -- isn’t available online, but Moody’s gave us a copy. We found that the ad accurately portrays the report’s findings. A table of the states ranked by "net tax-supported debt per capita" shows Massachusetts in the number-one spot, at $4,153 per person. We should note that this is not the only way to measure debt. Tax-supported debt is defined as long-term indebtedness payable from tax revenues, with long-term typically meaning maturities at least 15 years after issuance. And then there is "self-supporting debt," which is repaid from revenues generated by the enterprise itself. Annual state fiscal statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau use a more expansive definition of debt than just the tax-supported kind, so we decided to look at this data set as well. As it turns out, in 2007, Massachusetts also ranked number-one in the nation with $10,612 in debt per capita. So the Obama campaign has some solid grounding for its claim. But the ad glosses over some important context. Massachusetts’ debt includes local projects Massachusetts’ statewide debt figure may be larger than other states because it issued debt for some projects that in other states might be covered by counties. In a May 21, 2012, report on Massachusetts, Moody’s specifically noted this factor, saying that "debt levels have been driven upwards in part by the commonwealth's issuance of bonds to finance projects that in other states would be paid for at the local level." The debt accumulated under Romney often didn’t come from policies he pursued Many of the infrastructure projects contributing to Massachusetts’ high debt per capita ranking were initiated under prior governors and legislatures. A good example of this is the "Big Dig" -- the massive, and often controversial, project to transform the highways and tunnels of downtown Boston. It was initially conceived in the 1970s, with construction beginning in 1991 and continuing into Romney’s term as governor. In 2008, the Boston Globe estimated that the project will end up costing $22 billion and will not be paid off until 2038. It’s been called "the largest, most complex, and most technically challenging highway project in American history." The impact of the Big Dig on the state’s per capita debt totals was significant. According to a 2007 report from the Massachusetts state comptroller, the Big Dig is directly responsible for $4.2 billion in state debt and funding from sources other than the federal government or user fees. The Obama camp says it’s only fair for Romney to take responsibility for the debt on his watch since he challenged his Democratic opponent in a 2002 gubernatorial debate on the issue: "You said, I will stand up and engage the governor, and the Legislature -- I will use my bond-writing capacity to assure that we do not increase the state debt per person. And yet you didn't follow that promise. You broke that promise. We now have the highest state debt per person of any state in the nation." We think both attacks -- Romney’s in 2002 and Obama’s 2012 -- gloss over some important details. Massachusetts ranked high in debt per capita long before Romney became governor To compare Romney’s tenure to those of previous governors, we looked at the Census Bureau’s debt data every four years going back to 1995 to see where Massachusetts ranked nationally. Here’s what we found: 1995 -- Gov. William Weld (R): Massachusetts ranked 6th, with $4,566 in debt per capita 1999 -- Gov. Paul Celluci (R): Massachusetts ranked 2nd, with $5,797 in debt per capita 2003 -- Govs. Jane Swift (R) / Mitt Romney (R): Massachusetts ranked 2nd, with $7,551 in debt per capita 2007 -- Govs. Romney / Deval Patrick (D): Massachusetts ranked 1st, with $10,612 in debt per capita Looking at the numbers this way provides fodder for both sides. Obama’s case is bolstered by the fact that debt rose at a faster pace on Romney’s watch than in the previous four-year periods: 1995-1999: Up 27 percent 1999-2003: Up 30 percent 2003-2007: Up 41 percent However, the data shows that the Bay State ranked high on the national debt rankings well before Romney's inauguration. In 1999 (four years before Romney took office) and 2003 (the year he took office), Massachusetts ranked second in the nation in debt per capita "Massachusetts has had a high debt burden for decades, so governors are hamstrung to make any meaningful change in that picture in one or even two terms," said Michael J. Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes budget and tax issues in Massachusetts Our ruling The Obama campaign has accurately noted that Massachusetts had more debt per capita, by two different measurements, than any state in the country. However, this claim leaves out important context. Massachusetts ranked high long before Romney took office, in part because some of its debt supported projects that in other states would have been paid for by localities. Meanwhile, any suggestion that Romney’s stewardship on debt was harmful to the state is weakened by the state’s consistently high creditworthiness rating and the fact that Romney, by law, balanced the operating budget every year. Finally, much of the debt was actually initiated under the policies of prior governors and legislatures, and experts say that there was not much Romney could have done unilaterally to dramatically change the debt trajectory, particularly given a strong Democratic majority in the Legislature that regularly overrode his vetoes. The claim leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our definition of Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-06-18T14:34:55	2012-06-12	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-13386	Says top Clinton advisers "were pressing" birther movement stories "very hard."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/trump-again-tries-pin-birtherism-clinton-insiders/	The long running conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in America came back to haunt Donald Trump in the first presidential debate at Hofstra University. For about two months in 2011, Trump fueled a tentative presidential bid by raising doubts about Obama’s birthplace. The issue faded after Obama released a long-form version of his birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii, but it wasn’t until a couple of weeks ago that Trump publicly put the matter to rest. When debate moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what took him so long, Trump tried to divert blame for the birther movement to two Clinton insiders, Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton’s 2008 campaign manager, and Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and occasional staffer. "If you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened," Trump said. "Blumenthal sent McClatchy -- a highly respected reporter at McClatchy -- to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard." Were Solis Doyle and Blumenthal -- two top Clinton aides in 2008 -- pressing the birther movement very hard? We’ll take each person in turn. What Doyle said on CNN Doyle was on CNN on Sept. 16, 2016, and she was talking about an episode in 2007 during the Democratic primary. Doyle described a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who forwarded an email that promoted "the conspiracy." Asked during the interview if she meant the birther rumor, Doyle said she did. The Trump campaign pointed to this as an admission that at least someone in the campaign played a role. But Doyle later clarified she was referring to a volunteer who was fired for forwarding an email about Obama’s religion, not birthplace. Regardless of what Doyle said in her interview, that is what happened. (PolitiFact wrote about it here.) A rumor about Obama’s religion has an important difference from a rumor about his birthplace. While the two falsehoods overlap, only one -- whether he was born in the United States, would affect his ability to hold office under the Constitution. Blumenthal and McClatchy Blumenthal became a central figure in the birther controversy just recently. James Asher, the former Washington bureau chief of the McClatchy News service, tweeted on Sept. 15, 2016, that Blumenthal suggested in 2008 he look into rumors that Obama was born in Kenya. However, Blumenthal has told many news organizations that the editor’s claim is false, and that he never raised the issue of Obama’s birthplace. When a McClatchy reporter tried to reconstruct what actually happened, he confirmed that Blumenthal contacted Asher, and that a McClatchy reporter in Kenya explored whether Obama was born there, along with running down several other rumors. But McClatchy found no proof that Blumenthal questioned Obama’s birthplace. The article quoted an email Blumenthal sent to Asher in 2008. While Blumenthal discusses Obama’s family connections to Kenya, there’s no mention of where Obama was born. "On Kenya, your person in the field might look into the impact there of Obama’s public comments about his father. I’m told by State Dept officials that Obama publicly derided his father on his visit there and that was regarded as embarrassing," Blumenthal wrote. Asher gave a new statement to McClatchy that steps back a bit from the certainty he expressed in his original tweet. "Blumenthal visited the Washington Bureau of McClatchy, where he and I met in my office," Asher said. "During that conversation and in subsequent communications, we discussed a number of matters related to Obama. He encouraged McClatchy to do stories related to Obama and his connections to Kenya." Asher said he remembered Blumenthal mentioning Obama’s birthplace but acknowledged that he had nothing in writing. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton insiders pushed the rumor that Obama was not born in America. His first example, Doyle, actually was involved in firing a county level volunteer coordinator who spread the rumor that Obama was a Muslim. The president’s religion might overlap thematically, but it is distinct from rumors about his birthplace. Trump’s focus on Blumenthal lacks solid evidence. Blumenthal denies the allegation and the man who made it says he has no written proof.

pomt-09285	"Everyone in this country has access to health care."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/27/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-everyone-has-access-health-car/	Gov. Rick Perry, presiding over the state with the nation's biggest share of uninsured residents, recently suggested that Americans have access to health care regardless of their insurance status. Perry, who has objected to the federal mandate passed into law requiring most Americans to obtain health coverage by 2014, told the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine April 15: "There is a misnomer out there, I think, there's a misconception, that somehow or another... uninsured means that you have no health care. That's not correct. "Everyone in this country has access to health care." Everyone? Even people without health insurance? When we asked for back-up for Perry's statement, his campaign didn't offer any data or additional analysis. Next, we looked at hospital emergency rooms, often the portal through which uninsured people seek treatment. Some background: In 1986, Congress responded to concerns that emergency rooms were refusing to treat indigent and uninsured people — a practice known as patient dumping — by approving the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. The act requires all hospitals with emergency rooms that participate in the Medicare program to medically screen, treat and stabilize any patient (including illegal immigrants) who shows up with an emergency medical condition. The law doesn't require hospitals to offer preventive or follow-up care. However, not every condition that merits treatment is an emergency, and not every town has an emergency room. In Texas, 64 of the state's 254 counties don't have a hospital because it isn't economically viable, "particularly in the Panhandle and West Texas," said Amanda Engler, spokeswoman for the Texas Hospital Association. Still, Engler said "everyone should be able to access some level of care through the community." A national health care expert, Henry Aaron at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, echoed Engler, saying that "everyone has access to some health care. The issue is what care and how much of it... If you live in a place where few physicians practice and you don't have a car, you may not get much." Remote hospitals that receive extra Medicare funding, designed to improve health care access in rural areas, offer lower quality of care on average than their metro counterparts, according to a 2009 report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service. The department also found that rural health care focuses on providing primary and emergency care locally, and referring patients to regional, often distant health care centers for specialized care. Next, we wondered if a person's insurance status affects their access to care. The Institute of Medicine, which researches the relationship between health insurance and access to health care, has found that health insurance makes it easier to get preventive services. In 2002, the institute reviewed 130 studies examining whether people without health insurance still get care they need. The upshot? Working-age Americans without insurance were more likely to receive too little medical care too late, be sicker and die sooner; they also were more likely to receive worse care than the insured when they're in the hospital, and less likely to receive recommended health screening services, like mammograms, Pap tests or checking your cholesterol. Other institute findings: the uninsured lack regular access to medications to manage conditions like hypertension or HIV infection; don't receive care recommended for chronic diseases, like timely eye exams to prevent blindness in people with diabetes; and receive fewer diagnostic and treatment services after a traumatic injury or heart attack. The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured reached similar conclusions. In 2009, the commission, part of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health care policy, analyzed a national health care survey tracking 17,800 people in 9,400 families, finding that more than 50 percent of uninsured adults have no regular source of health care and are more than twice as likely to delay or forgo care than the insured. Ed Haislmaier, a health care expert at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, said: "If you have insurance coverage, as a general rule, you're more likely to access health care because presumably some portion of the insurance coverage pays for the cost." According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, some 83 percent of Americans currently have insurance coverage either through their employer, the private market or government programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Kaiser found the majority of the estimated 46 million uninsured are less likely than the insured to to pay for basic health care, and overall, they're less likely to receive preventive care. But Haislmaier said even insurance doesn't guarantee health care access — particularly to primary care physicians. For example, the Medicaid reimbursement rate for primary care physicians varies by state, so the less a state pays doctors for the costs of treating people covered under Medicaid, the less likely that doctor is to accept that person as a patient. "You can be living in the middle of New York City, but if you're on Medicaid, good luck getting a doctor to see you," Haislmaier said, citing Kaiser's Medicaid-to-Medicare Fee Index, a benchmark for how much each state is reimbursing its doctors to treat Medicaid patients by comparing it to the Medicare reimbursement rate. In 2008, New York reimbursed primary care doctors 36 percent of how much they would pay that doctor to treat a Medicare patient. The national average is 66 percent; Texas reimburses primary care docs 68 percent. What's more, Kaiser says, various safety nets like community clinics and public hospitals don't offer the broad range of health care, including mental health services that insurance provides. Case in point: In 2003, Texas legislators retooled the public mental health system — 39 state-funded community mental health centers that serve indigent, low-income and uninsured people — to focus on patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. People with other mental illnesses, like anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, rarely qualified for help unless they went into crisis, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). According to the agency, thousands more sometimes wait more than a year to get medication, therapy, substance abuse care and other services from community centers. Among them are 6,800 adults and children with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression — two-thirds of whom are currently receiving no services. Where does all that leave Perry's statement that everyone has access to health care? Somewhere on the continuum between hypothothesis and reality. While many avenues exist for making health care available, the reality is that many people cannot use them, and millions don't get the care they need. We rate Perry's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12322	Says Jon Ossoff "doesn't even live in (his) district."	true	/georgia/statements/2017/jun/20/donald-trump/trump-right-ossoff-does-not-live-georgias-6th-cong/	Unless President Donald Trump pre-schedules his tweets, we know what he was doing as the sun rose in Washington -- tweeting a warning to voters in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District on the day of the most expensive House election ever. "Democrat Jon Ossoff, who wants to raise your taxes to the highest level and is weak on crime and security, doesn't even live in district," Trump tweeted on June 20. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com For the record, Ossoff has said he would oppose any increase in income taxes. Since this is the second time in less than 24 hours that Trump has brought up Ossoff’s residency, we thought we’d clear that up. He tweeted on Monday, June 19, "Karen Handel's opponent in #GA06 can't even vote in the district he wants to represent because he doesn't even live there!" Trump is correct. This is not news in Georgia. By February, Ossoff was fielding questions on where he lives. He acknowledged that he and his girlfriend (now fiancee) live near Emory University where she’s in medical school. That’s next door to the 6th District, but not in it. When CNN brought it up, Ossoff said he plans to move back to the district. "As soon as she concludes her medical training, I will be back into the district where I grew up, but I want to support her and her career and do right by her," he said. "I will be 10 minutes back up the road where I grew up." How far away is he from the district’s boundaries? According to Ossoff’s biography on his website, he was raised in Northlake, an unincorporated community in the 6th District. Taking nothing for granted, we mapped the distance from the Emory University campus to his old stomping grounds. According to Google, it’s about 6 miles and takes about 17 minutes to drive, non-rush hour. Ossoff told MSNBC he lives about two miles from the district line. The medical school itself is about four miles away, and according to Google, about a 12-minute drive. To round out the picture, Ossoff’s opponent, Republican Karen Handel, grew up in the Maryland suburbs of Washington and has lived in the 6th District for 25 years. Our ruling Trump said Ossoff doesn’t live in the 6th District. That is correct. Depending on how you map it, he lives about 2 to 6 miles either from the district or the neighborhood where he was raised. We rate this claim True.

pomt-13341	"10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/04/mike-pence/pence-repeats-false-claim-clinton-foundations-limi/	In the vice presidential debate, Republican Mike Pence tried to skewer Hillary Clinton by talking about the multi-billion dollar Clinton Foundation. Pence recycled a flawed GOP talking point that the foundation is a cash cow to enrich the Clintons and their friends. "10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes," Pence said. This is based on a misunderstanding of how the foundation operates. In brief, it raises money to deliver services and projects itself. The amount of money it gives away as grants is a small sliver of its activities. We’ll use the Clinton Foundation’s most recent IRS tax form, for 2014, as an example. (It starts on Page 28 of this document.) The foundation reported total expenses in 2014 of a little over $91 million but grants of just $5.1 million. That’s close to 6 percent of the foundation’s money being spent on grants. But that doesn’t mean everything else is overhead, people who monitor charities and their practices say, or that only 10 cents of every dollar went to a charitable cause. "Although it has ‘foundation’ in its name, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity," Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, wrote in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. "In practical terms, this means both that it relies heavily on donations from the public and that it achieves its mission primarily by using those donations to conduct direct charitable activities, as opposed to providing grants from an endowment." What are some of the foundation’s programs? The Clinton Development Initiative helps farmers in Malawi, Rwanda and Tanzania raise more crops and get higher prices at the market. The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership launched the Acceso Centro de Formacion to provide job training for people in Cartagena, Colombia. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, for instance, has gotten credit for providing access to lower-cost drugs for millions of people with HIV/AIDS. Financial statement rules require a nonprofit to split its expenses between program services, fundraising and management/general costs (the latter two are collectively what are referred to as "overhead"), Mittendorf told us. He said that in 2014, 87.2 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s expenses were on program services. "Of course, this only speaks to how the organization used its funds and not whether that 87.2 percent was allocated to the most effective program efforts, but it is all we have in terms of verifiable data on this question," Mittendorf said. The American Institute of Philanthropy’s Charity Watch, reached the same conclusion. It has given the Clinton Foundation an A rating and says it spends only 12 percent of the money it raises on "overhead." "The Clinton Foundation is an excellent charity," Charity Watch president Daniel Borochoff said Aug. 24, 2016, on CNN. "They are able to get 88 percent of their spending to bona fide program services and their fundraising efficiency is really low. It only costs them $2 to raise $100." Other Republican critics of the foundation have used slightly higher figures than Pence. Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus said the foundation only spent 20 percent on good works. Conservative radio talker Rush Limbaugh said it was 15 percent. Those are inaccurate, too. Our ruling Pence said 10 cents on every dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes. While it’s true that the foundation gives away in grants a small fraction of its resources, about 87 percent of its expenses go toward services it provides directly. A leading expert in the finances of philanthropies, Mittendorf, says that while the Clinton Foundation calls itself a foundation, it operates like a public charity. Mittendorf cautioned that while the dollar amounts are clear and verified, that is no guarantee that the programs are effective and efficient. However, that is not the criticism Pence raised.

pomt-14420	"Now we have ISIS coming over the (U.S.-Mexico) border."	false	/arizona/statements/2016/mar/10/jeff-dewit/isis-crossing-us-mexico-border/	Arizona State Treasurer and Donald Trump’s state campaign chairman, Jeff DeWit, claimed ISIS was crossing the border while lobbying for Trump on immigration in a Feb. 22 interview with CNN’s Carol Costello. "Myself being in Arizona, we know firsthand that tens of thousands of people that come over illegally every month there's a big problem on the border. There's drugs pouring over," DeWit said. "Now we have ISIS coming over the border. You have problems. There's only one candidate that's going to do anything to fix it, and that's Donald Trump." He isn’t the first Arizona official to tie ISIS to the U.S-Mexico border. But there’s no evidence to support the claim. PolitiFact researched similar statements before: Arizona Congressman Trent Franks claimed that ISIS was present in Mexico back in September 2014. That claim was unfounded -- not a single law enforcement official could confirm it. We rated it Mostly False. Citing a report from right-leaning Judicial Watch, California Rep. Duncan Hunter said that U.S. Border Patrol agents caught at least 10 ISIS fighters on the border in Texas back in October 2014. U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron rebuked the claim, noting that individuals with ties to ISIS apprehended at the border is "categorically false." We rated Hunter’s statement Pants on Fire. We decided to delve into DeWit’s ISIS claim. Is this terrorist group crossing the border? Officials say it’s not happening DeWit spokesman Sean Dollman provided us with links to several news stories, including the Judicial Watch report cited by Hunter. Dollman said it is well-documented enough "to be mentioned by the Treasurer as a valid concern." But he could not provide us with actual evidence that ISIS is crossing the border. Multiple officials disputed DeWit’s claim. While a small number of people from Middle Eastern countries have been detained near the border, none have been tied to ISIS (also called Islamic State or ISIL). Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Damon Cecil could not confirm the presence of ISIS at the border. "We do know that people from Middle Eastern countries have crossed the U.S./Mexican border in Arizona. We are not able to confirm that anyone caught trying to illegally enter the U.S. from Mexico has ties to ISIS or any other terrorist organization," Cecil said. The influx of immigrants from the Middle East using the U.S.-Mexico border, however, goes back several years. A report released in 2006 from the House Committee on Homeland Security states that "each year, hundreds of illegal aliens from countries known to harbor terrorists or promote terrorism" are routinely encountered when they attempt to cross the border. The report also notes that several items have been found at the Rio Grande River, which runs from Colorado through Mexico, including a "jacket with patches from countries where al-Qaida is known to operate." Moreover, the report definitively states that members of terrorist group Hezbollah "have already entered the United States" using the border sometime before 2005. An August 2009 Government Accountability Office report also notes that Border Patrol encountered three people with "links to terrorism" at southwest border checkpoints in fiscal year 2008. The House Committee on Homeland Security released an updated report in 2012. According to this report, from fiscal years 2006 to 2011, 1,918 "special interest" aliens, or aliens with ties to countries that "could bring harm" via terrorism, were apprehended at the border. But, as far as ISIS, the connection isn’t there. Recently, Border Patrol agents detained five Pakistani immigrants and one Afghan immigrant near the Arizona border in November 2015. However, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that records checks on the immigrants "revealed no derogatory information." Eight Syrians were also stopped at the Texas border in November, but DHS said they were regular migrants. Colin Clarke, an international security expert at the Rand Corporation, said he hasn’t seen any evidence of ISIS coming in over the border, but it’s possible. "The border is vulnerable, why wouldn’t they try that?" Clarke said. "It’s certainly feasible that these guys could, through multiple attempts, smuggle someone across." Tim Nichols, an intelligence expert and associate professor at Duke University, said he is not aware of any information supporting DeWit’s statement. And neither are the feds. "The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground," said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson. We also reached out to Mexico’s embassy in Washington D.C. Their spokesman, Ariel Moutsatsos-Morales, refuted DeWit’s claim. "The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies any statement on the alleged presence of ISIS's operating cells throughout the border region. Mexican authorities have no record of the presence of Islamist extremist groups or individuals in Mexico. Officials from Mexico and the United States maintain permanent contact with each other and continuously exchange information on security threats," Morales said. A June 2015 State Department terrorism report makes this clear too: "There were no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, despite several erroneous press reports to the contrary during 2014. There was no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory." Our ruling DeWit said, "now we have ISIS coming over the border." There is no definitive evidence of that. Yes, people with ties to the Middle East have been encountered at the border. Members of terrorist group Hezbollah entered the United States via the border sometime before 2005. But there’s no evidence that terrorists linked to ISIS have crossed the border, and many public safety officials have said flatly that it hasn’t happened. For that, we rate DeWit’s claim as False.

pomt-01484	"In 2001 and '02 . . . we had the pension system funded at (the) 100% level in that year, and we did for two years at that point."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/sep/28/vincent-buddy-cianci/buddy-cianci-says-2001-and-02-when-he-was-providen/	Former Providence Mayor Vincent "Buddy" Cianci Jr. says he's running to regain his old job because he believes the city has gone downhill since he was forced to leave office in September 2002. One of the biggest problems facing the city is the lack of money and part of the problem is a severely-underfunded pension system. According to the most recent data, from July 31, 2013, the city has only 31.4 percent of the money it needs to pay for its pension obligations. During the Sept. 21 edition of WPRI-TV's "Newsmakers" program, which featured Cianci rattling off a blizzard of financial numbers about the city, host Tim White asked Cianci about his role in the pension shortfall. After playing an old video in which Cianci stressed the importance of fully paying the city's pension costs, White noted that from 1998 to 2002, the city was putting in only 60 percent or less of what it was supposed to be paying. Cianci said that he did pay in full, and he had a document to prove it. "In 2001 and '02, a letter that I have from the finance director says that we had the pension system funded at [the] 100 percent level in that year, and we did for two years at that point," he said. Cianci made it clear later in the interview that he was referring to the two years prior to his leaving office. So was the Cianci administration putting all of the money it was supposed to into the pension fund in those two years? The short answer is no. City pension records show that in the 2001 fiscal year, the city paid only 60.6 percent of the amount it needed to properly fund its pension program. That amount is an estimate known as the annual required contribution, or ARC. And in 2002, another year when Cianci said the pension was being funded at 100 percent, the funding level was actually 64.2 percent. Only in the 2003 fiscal year, when Cianci was mayor for just over two months (to be succeeded by John Lombardi and, later, David Cicilline, now a U.S. representative) did the ratio rise significantly, to 80.3 percent. By then, the pension fund was hobbled with a massive debt, with only $335 million of the $899 million it needed. And what about the letter Cianci was talking about? First, a little background. From 1991 through the 1994 fiscal year, and again in the 1996 fiscal year, Providence was paying 100 percent of the ARC. (Cianci, who had been mayor from 1975 until 1984 when he was removed from office after being convicted of felony assault, began his second stint as mayor in 1991.) But after the first few years of Cianci's second administration, the funding for Providence's pension program began a precipitous decline. The city paid 54 percent in 1995, then 93.6 percent in 1997, 57.5 percent in 1998, 56.2 in 1999, 60.0 percent in 2000. Cianci and Alex Prignano, who was Cianci's finance director at the time and is now business manager in the Cumberland school department, told PolitiFact Rhode Island in a joint interview that pension benefits were the subject of lawsuits. To make a long story short, Cianci had agreed in 1991 to annual 5-percent cost-of-living increases; in 1994, amid concerns over the mounting expense of funding them, the city filed suit seeking relief from the increases. As the suit progressed, the city based its pension fund payments on the assumption that it would win the suit. It was also working under the belief that if it fully funded the pension system, it would be harder to argue in court that the cost of living payments were unsustainable, Prignano and Cianci said. (The Providence Journal's Tom Mooney outlined the saga in a June 7, 2011 story.) When the state Supreme Court ruled on the case in 2000, the decision produced an annual pension shortfall of about $16 million, Prignano said. He developed a timetable to bring the payment level back up to 100 percent. The letter Cianci was referring to is dated Aug. 23, 2002, exactly two weeks before Cianci would be removed for office once again, this time after being convicted of racketeering conspiracy. In the letter, Prignano writes about Cianci's support for "a four-year plan that my office proposed in fiscal 2000 to fully fund the annual pension contribution according to the amount recommended by the actuary." In other words, Prignano explained in his interview with PolitiFact, Cianci had agreed to the timetable for bringing the funding back to 100 percent of the city's ARC. The percentage the city was paying started to rise -- albeit very slowly -- in 2000. The biggest increases didn't come until Cianci left office. And as Prignano acknowledged, it wouldn't hit 100 percent until 2007, five years after Cianci left, when David Cicilline was mayor. Cianci said that when he talked about funding the pension system at 100 percent, he was referring to 100 percent of the amount recommended by Prignano, not the full 100 percent of the annual required contribution. Our ruling Cianci said, "In 2001 and '02 . . . we had the pension system funded at [the] 100 percent level in that year, and we did for two years at that point." But the last full contribution to the system under Cianci was in 1996. During the last years of his term, he short-changed the system each year by more than a third of the money it would ultimately need. That would have a long-term deleterious impact on the health of the pension plan. Cianci contends his "100 percent" remark referred to a plan to eventually restore the funding level. But although he had ample time to explain that during the "Newsmaker" interview, he never made that clear. And viewers likely came away with the false impression that Cianci had given the pension fund the full amount it needed in those years. We rate Cianci's claim False.

pomt-04158	"Last year, handguns killed 48 people in Japan, 8 in Great Britain, 34 in Switzerland, 52 in Canada, 58 in Israel, 21 in Sweden, 42 in West Germany and 10,728 in the United States."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/dec/23/facebook-posts/facebook-posting-handgun-deaths-has-out-date-numbe/	The day after the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., sparked another round of debate about gun control in the United States, an illustration began making the rounds on Facebook contending that handgun deaths in the United States are wildly higher than in other developed countries. Emblazoned with a picture of a gun painted with stars and stripes, it reports that, "Last year, handguns killed 48 people in Japan, 8 in Great Britain, 34 in Switzerland, 52 in Canada, 58 in Israel, 21 in Sweden, 42 in West Germany and 10,728 in the United States." The version we saw had originally been posted Nov. 24, nearly three weeks before the Connecticut massacre. By Dec. 20, six days after the tragedy, it had been shared more than 46,000 times. We wondered if the statistics were correct, especially because there hasn't been a "West Germany" since 1990. The illustration invites people to call or write to Handgun Control Inc. in Washington, D.C. The phone number no longer works. That's because in 2001 the group was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Brady is James Brady, President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, who was shot and permanently disabled during an assassination attempt on Reagan in 1981. When we contacted the Brady organization, they sent us a new illustration with different numbers and listing different countries. It says: "In one year, guns murdered 17 people in Finland, 35 in Australia, 39 in England and Wales, 60 in Spain, 194 in Germany, 200 in Canada, and 9,484 in the United States." Note that it doesn't specify the year, nor does it specify handguns. It talks about all gun homicides. Brady also sent us a fact sheet from 2010 that lists its sources, which allowed us to spot-check their statistics. We found that most of the numbers come from 2008, their counts were right on (or close to) the mark, and the reports from other countries do not separate handguns from other firearms, probably because the number of firearm homicides is so small to begin with. We found more recent United Nations data for some of those countries, and they support the pattern. Let's pause for a moment to acknowledge two points. First, these statistics deal with murders involving guns, not accidental deaths from firearms. The second is an issue of language. The Facebook posting says "handguns killed." The Brady illustration says "guns murdered." The correct phrasing would be "handguns were used to kill" or "guns were used to murder." The numbers in both illustrations fail to account for a few important factors. The first is population. The number of gun homicides in Israel is expected to be lower than in the United States because it has fewer than 8 million people compared to more than 313 million in the United States. Second, the overall homicide rate is generally lower in other Western countries. For example, the murder rate in the United States is more than five times higher than in Germany. A culture where murder is less common is automatically going to have fewer gun deaths. It's interesting to note how often killers use a gun when they commit a murder. In the United States, two thirds of murders involve firearms. It's less than 10 percent in England and Japan. In Switzerland, it was 72 percent in 2004, although the murder rate is low to begin with. We'll leave it up to gun advocates and opponents to debate the degree to which gun control laws influence the risks reflected in numbers. Finally, to put the numbers in a broader perspective, many countries have higher rates of gun murders than the United States. They tend to be in South and Central America. As for the rates in the countries cited in the Facebook posting and the Brady illustration, here are the latest United Nations numbers: Country and year of most recent data Number of firearm homicides that year Odds of being murdered with a firearm that year Odds of being murdered that year Percent homicides involving a firearm United States ('10) 9,960 1 in 31,000 1 in 24,000 67.5% Switzerland ('04) 57 1 in 125,000 1 in 91,000 72.2% Canada ('09) 173 1 in 200,000 1 in 56,000 32.0% Finland ('09) 24 1 in 250,000 1 in 43,000 19.8% Sweden ('04) 37 1 in 250,000 1 in 83,000 33.9% Spain ('09) 90 1 in 500,000 1 in 111,000 21.8% Germany ('10) 158 1 in 500,000 1 in 125,000 26.3% Israel ('07) 6 1 in 1,000,000 1 in 53,000 11.7% Australia ('09) 30 1 in 1,000,000 1 in 83,000 11.5% England & Wales ('10) 41 1 in 1,000,000 1 in 83,000 6.6% Japan ('08) 11 more than 1 in 1,000,000 1 in 200,000 1.8% Sources: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and United Nations Statistics Division Our ruling A Facebook posting reported, "Last year, handguns killed 48 people in Japan, 8 in Great Britain, 34 in Switzerland, 52 in Canada, 58 in Israel, 21 in Sweden, 42 in West Germany and 10,728 in the United States." The numbers are wildly out of date. They also omit important context, such as population size or a country's cultural attitudes toward the acceptability of violence and gun use. The list also tends to focus on Western well-to-do countries. But the phenomenon reported in the illustration is correct. The odds of being murdered by a gun in the United States is far in excess of the risk seen in the countries named in the Facebook posting, and in the newer illustration developed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. For those reasons, we rate the statement Half True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.) (The second paragraph of our ruling was modified after publication to clarify that cultural attitudes toward violence influence a country's gun-related murder rate.)

pomt-06890	"Recently we have seen our government debt grow by $3.4 trillion during the first 29 months of the Obama administration -- the equivalent of about $4 billion per day."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/28/leonard-lance/us-rep-leonard-lance-says-government-debt-has-grow/	Rep. Leonard Lance recently criticized the Washington establishment for spending the nation into a fiscal crisis. In a July 17 column, Lance (R-7th Dist.) blamed both sides of the political aisle for driving up government debt , but also singled out President Barack Obama. "Recently we have seen our government debt grow by $3.4 trillion during the first 29 months of the Obama administration -- the equivalent of about $4 billion per day," Lance wrote in the column published on CourierPostOnline.com. PolitiFact New Jersey checked whether government debt has increased that much since Obama took office -- and whether the president is responsible. We found Lance’s statistics are correct, but Obama’s role in debt growth is more difficult to pin down. There are two types of government debt: one includes debt held by the public and the other includes debt held directly by the government, such as in trust funds for Social Security and Medicare. Collectively, those two types of debt make up gross national debt. Lance’s spokeswoman, Angie Lundberg, said the congressman was referring to debt held by the public. Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009. From then until July 15 -- the most recent data available at the time Lance made his statement -- publicly held debt increased more than $3.4 trillion, from more than $6.3 trillion to more than $9.75 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury Department data. That’s a $3.75 billion increase per day. Round up and it’s "the equivalent of about $4 billion per day." So, Lance had his numbers right. But is Obama responsible for that increase? Lundberg said Lance didn’t "lay blame on how we acquired that debt, just stated the fact." But Lance highlighted the debt growth during Obama’s tenure, so we’ll look at how much the president is at fault. Let’s note that when Obama took office he inherited all the debt accumulated by his predecessor, President George W. Bush. An April report by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative analyzed the difference in the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s projections of publicly held debt and the actual debt from 2001 to 2011. The report found that about two-thirds of debt growth -- expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic product -- during that time resulted from new legislation, some of which was enacted under Bush. The report said the Bush tax cuts, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the 2009 stimulus are three of the five "most significant legislative drivers" of the debt, but also notes that "no single policy or piece of legislation, however, is overwhelmingly responsible" for the increase. We also spoke with five experts from different Washington, D.C.-think tanks. The general consensus was that while Obama can’t be saddled with all of the growth in debt since taking office, he is responsible for some of the increase. Michael Linden, director for tax and budget policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, argued that the debt attributable to Obama would be the amount accrued from legislation Obama signed, including: the stimulus package, extension of the Bush tax cuts -- though he notes that was a bipartisan deal -- and his budgets. "It’s difficult to tease out exactly how much" that’d account for, Linden said, "but it’s definitely not the whole $3.4 trillion." Kevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Obama’s policies are to blame for most of the change in spending that contributed to debt growth, but not most of the change in revenues. Assigning blame for either entirely to the president would be wrong, he said. Isabel Sawhill, a budget expert with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution said Obama and factors outside his control are to blame for rising debt. "Obama’s actions to fight the financial crisis and the recession did add to the deficits and debt but are not the major culprits," she said in an email, citing "a persistent gap between spending and revenues, largely because of the aging population and the growing cost of health care." Marc Goldwein, policy director of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, highlighted some legislation Obama signed that added to the debt, but said the economy is a factor. Let’s review. Lance correctly stated that government debt held by the public grew by $3.4 trillion during Obama’s tenure. But experts said that while Obama can be blamed for some of that increase, he isn’t responsible for it all. We rate Lance’s statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14422	"The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-wants-delay-cl/	Debating in a city where rising sea levels are a concern, Hillary Clinton suggested Bernie Sanders wants to set back a major climate change policy of the Obama administration. "The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense," Clinton said. "What? Tsk," Sanders said, laughing and shaking his head incredulously. "Wait, what?" was our reaction too. Looking at statements and actions by Sanders, Clinton’s statement is misleading. Briefly, the Clean Power Plan aims to cut carbon emissions from coal-burning power plants by 2030 by 32 percent from 2005 levels, promoting clean(er) energy sources instead. This plan, hailed and criticized as a historic environmental initiative, was put on hold on Feb. 9, 2016, by the U.S. Supreme Court. We searched Google, LexisNexis and CQ for comments Sanders has made on the plan and found no evidence that Sanders has said he wants to delay the implementation. The Clinton campaign referred us to Sanders’ Feb. 21 interview with Grist, an environmental online magazine, in which he laid out what President Sanders would likely do on climate change. Sanders said he would change the Clean Power Plan to incentivize renewables instead of gas and extend a two-year program for wind and solar credits all the way to 2030. And beyond carbon, he would also regulate methane through the plan. The Clinton campaign also cited environmental law expert Richard Revesz’s blog post for The Hill criticizing Sanders. The Clean Power Plan "cannot be changed at the stroke of the pen," Revesz wrote a few days after the Grist interview, and Sanders’ actions would "stop the train and cause a great delay." (Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor, made the same argument.) But Sanders himself did not say he would delay implementation. In reality, he wants a more ambitious plan (and has released one) and has supported Obama’s plan from the get-go. A day before it was unveiled, Sanders said in a press release, "It sounds to me like a step forward in ending our dependence on fossil fuel, and I support that effort." He also tweeted that day, "Pres Obama knows climate change is the great planetary crisis facing us & we must move boldly to transform our energy system #CleanPowerPlan." And in November, Sanders voted twice against legislation to block the Clean Power Plan. "It is an embarrassment that with few exceptions Republicans refuse to recognize the reality of climate change, and even fewer are prepared to do anything about it," he wrote in a press release following the effort to repeal the plan. "Today’s vote to block the Clean Power Plan is a stark reminder that instead of worrying about the future of our planet, Republicans are more concerned with their campaign contributions." Our ruling Clinton said, "The Clean Power Plan is something that Sen. Sanders has said he would delay implementing." Sanders advocates for more ambitious action on climate change, which some experts argue could delay the plan. But Sanders himself has never said what Clinton is suggesting, and he has supported the Clean Power Act in words and action. We rate Clinton’s claim False.

pomt-01475	The Justice Department’s Fast and Furious gun-walking program "started in the Bush administration."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/30/jane-harman/jane-harman-incorrectly-claims-fast-and-furious-gu/	Pundits are dissecting the complicated legacy of Attorney General Eric Holder, who intends to resign the position he’s had since 2009 when the Senate confirms his successor. Some have analyzed the move with less accuracy than others. Jane Harman, a former Democratic congresswoman from California and CEO of the Wilson Center, argued Holder accomplished many good things as the nation’s first black attorney general, but he could be faulted "for being politically tone-deaf." "And some of the things he did I think backfired. Not dropping Fast and Furious, which started in the Bush administration, was a mistake," she said during a Sept. 28 Fox News Sunday panel. "Not notifying people about the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed trial in New York before he announced it, was a mistake. And not -- and the timing of the indictments of the Chinese was a mistake. But on balance is, I think his tone and his professionalism and his focus on race were pluses." Harman’s claim about the origin of the Justice Department’s controversial "Fast and Furious" program was flagged by one of our readers. It is inaccurate. President Barack Obama made the same error during the 2012 election season in describing the program’s launch. PolitiFact rated his claim that it started "under the previous administration" as False. The "Fast and Furious" operation started in October 2009, about 10 months into Obama’s first term. Under the program, federal agents based in Arizona allowed straw buyers to buy guns in the United States and cross into Mexico so the weapons could be traced to, in theory, high-level drug cartel members. The idea backfired when two guns that the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had lost track of were found at the crime scene of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, who was killed Dec. 14, 2010. Investigations launched by Congress and the Justice Department in the wake of Terry’s death found many flaws with the "gun-walking" program designed by ATF’s Phoenix Field Division to go after cartels. So Fast and Furious doesn’t date back to Bush. But the idea of gun-walking in general does trace back to the previous administration. The Justice Department’s inspector general noted that the gun-walking strategy originated in the ATF’s Phoenix office under a 2006 program named "Operation Wide Receiver." Operation Wide Receiver unfolded between March 2006 and December 2007 with ATF agents based in Tucson. The agents knew firearms were being purchased by straw buyers for illegal use in Mexico but did not go after the weapons. Ultimately, the inspector general’s report found that the agents did not make any arrests as a result of the program and seized fewer than 100 of about 400 firearms that were purchased. Harman said via a spokesman, "The gun-walking program began in 2006 under the Bush Administration. It had a different name, but it was a similar program." Our ruling Harman said Fast and Furious "started in the Bush administration." Like a similarly worded claim from Obama two years ago, her claim is inaccurate. There was a program run by ATF’s Phoenix Field Division called Operation Wide Receiver that started during the Bush administration, but Operation Fast and Furious was a specific effort launched after Obama took office in 2009. We rate her claim False.	None	Jane Harman	None	None	None	2014-09-30T08:40:10	2014-09-28	['None']
pomt-01186	President Barack Obama "said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority" to act as he did on immigration.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/dec/05/michael-mccaul/michael-mccaul-says-obama-said-over-20-times-he-la/	Echoing the U.S. House speaker, Rep. Michael McCaul of Austin charged President Barack Obama with disregarding many of his own statements by declaring the government would stop deporting millions of unauthorized residents. At a Dec. 2, 2014, hearing, McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson: "The president said over 20 times that he did not have the legal authority to do this, to take this executive action, and that this is not how democracy works. Do you agree with that prior statement?" Johnson replied: "Mr. Chairman, I know from 30 years as a lawyer that when someone paraphrases remarks from somebody, I want to see the full Q-and-A, I want to see the full context to know exactly what the person said. I have looked at various excerpts of remarks by the president concerning his legal authority to act. I do not believe that what we have done is inconsistent with that." Shortly before Obama detailed his 2014 moves, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., found False the Democratic president’s statement that his position hadn’t changed on using executive authority to address immigration. Notably, the administration in June 2012 demonstrated a willingness to apply its discretionary powers by issuing a "deferred action" directive that immigration officials not deport young immigrants who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. The move potentially shielded hundreds of thousands of residents under age 30. Critics called the move an abuse of authority. Proponents said it was in keeping with the yet-to-pass DREAM Act providing a path to citizenship for children brought to the U.S. by immigrants not legally permitted to live here. So, Obama used to say his ability to take action ended at deferring action against children of unauthorized residents. But he lately has been saying there were additional things he could and would do. In his Nov. 20, 2014, announcement touching off Republican objections, Obama said he would delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If an applicant can pass a background check and pay a fee, he or she could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which is expected to open for applications this spring. It’s one thing for Obama to attempt revisionist history. But is McCaul right that the president previously forswore his authority to act – and more than 20 times? Boehner’s Obama breakdown By email, McCaul spokesman Mike Rosen pointed out a Nov. 19, 2014, blog post by the Republican House speaker, John Boehner, stating Obama had said 22 times he couldn’t ignore or create his own immigration law. We explored each of Boehner’s citations by establishing what Obama said from original source materials including transcripts and news stories. Upshot: About 15 of the tallied Obama statements suggest Obama didn’t think he had the power to do more on immigration by himself, hence backing up McCaul’s statement. We’ll summarize those statements in this story and greater detail lies in the document here. However, around half a dozen of Boehner’s examples showed Obama saying or hinting otherwise about his executive powers or not talking about his independent ability to affect immigrants. Times Obama was silent or signaled he did have power For instance, Boehner brought up two Obama statements from when he was running for president in 2008 and criticizing "signing statements" like ones employed by President George W. Bush to interpret legislation signed into law; neither of these items showed Obama bringing up immigration. On July 1, 2010, Obama laid out his hopes Congress would reach an immigration law overhaul. In his remarks, he recognized "there are those in the immigrants’ rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are (here) illegally with legal status, or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws. And often this argument is framed in moral terms: Why should we punish people who are just trying to earn a living?" Obama said such an action would be "unwise and unfair," but he didn’t address whether he thought he had the power to take such action. Boehner’s list also folded in Obama’s reply at an October 2010 MTV/BET event about his position on the military’s since-eclipsed policy of "don’t ask, don’t tell." "I can’t simply ignore laws that are out there," Obama said. But immigration was not part of his reply while to another question, Obama stressed border security and otherwise urged a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws. Boehner also listed Obama’s remarks at an April 2011 event. In that instance, though, the president focused on his desire for bipartisan immigration reform – and didn’t speak explicitly to his executive powers. "I can't solve this problem by myself," Obama said,adding: "We're going to have to change the laws in Congress." At a September 2011 White House roundtable, Obama was asked about granting "administrative relief" enabling students lacking legal residency to stay in the country. His answer seemed to indicate he saw wiggle room for the administration, which makes sense given the soon-to-debut deferred-action mandate. Obama initially said: "I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true." But, he went on, "what we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources." In a July 2013 Univision interview, which we found excerpted in an NPR news story, Obama was asked if, in the event Congress failed to pass immigration legislation, he could use his power to give amnesty to the estimated 11 million unauthorized U.S. residents. His answer left wiggle room. "Probably not," Obama replied. "I think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative. I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus." A more recent Obama quotation offered by Boehner seemingly contradicts McCaul’s statement. In August 2014, Obama indicated to reporters that he might have room to act on his own. In the face of no congressional movement on immigration legislation, Obama said, "what I can do is scour our authorities to try to make progress. And we’re going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you the American people don’t want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done." Times Obama said he couldn’t do more on immigration alone Let’s turn next to Obama statements, from Boehner’s list, that seem to support McCaul’s claim that Obama didn’t think he had independent legal authority to act on immigration -- some made before the deferred-action directive came out. In October 2010, Obama told Eddie "Piolin" Sotelo, a radio host on Spanish-speaking Univision, that he couldn’t achieve comprehensive immigration reform without congressional action. "I am president, I am not king," Obama said. "...I’m committed to making it happen, but I’ve got to have some partners to do it." At a Univision event in March 2011, Obama was asked if he could stop deportations of students with an order. That’s "just not the case," Obama said, "because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed... Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws." Simply issuing such an order, he said, "would not conform with my appropriate role as president." Yet he also hinted at wiggle room, saying: "That does not mean, though, that we can't make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity. In an April 2011 speech in Miami and the next month in El Paso, Obama said he couldn’t bypass Congress and change immigration laws himself, saying that’s not how a democracy works. Addressing the National Council of La Raza in July 2011, Obama drew exhortations to act without waiting for congressional agreement. He called that idea "tempting," then said "that's not how our system works." In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that "as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do… we’re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally," as in parents deported. At a presidential debate the next month, Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney were asked: "What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?" Obama said: "I've done everything that I can on my own." In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn’t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had aided law-abiding students. "I’m not a king," Obama replied, tracking his response the same month to a similar query from Univision and his reply at a February 2013 Google Hangout town hall where he also said "we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can." The same year, Obama was asked by Telemundo if he would consider freezing deportations of the parents of students benefiting from the administration’s 2012 action. Obama replied that if he broadened his protective orders, "then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option." We confirmed similar hitches on Obama’s part in a November 2013 speech in in San Francisco and a March 2014 Univision interview. See more detail on these presidential statements in our document here. White House response By email, White House spokesman Eric Schultz responded to our query about McCaul’s claim by pointing out a Nov. 19, 2014, memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel stating the president’s 2014 actions fit within the government’s discretionary powers. The office, in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies. Our ruling McCaul said Obama "said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority to" act as he did on immigration. The Texan’s count is too high – we see less than 15 solid examples from 2010 into 2014 – but his statement is spot-on about Obama often saying he couldn’t do more absent congressional action. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Michael McCaul	None	None	None	2014-12-05T13:45:24	2014-12-02	['None']
pomt-01907	"Hobby Lobby provided this (birth control) coverage before they decided to drop it to file suit."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/01/sally-kohn/did-hobby-lobby-once-provide-birth-control-coverag/	Hobby Lobby’s Supreme Court victory over the federal government’s contraception rule set off a fast-breaking wave of punditry on national TV. CNN brought in liberal pundit and contributor Sally Kohn, who panned the court’s 5-4 decision as disastrous and Hobby Lobby’s intentions as disingenuous. "Hobby Lobby provided this coverage before they decided to drop it to file suit, which was politically motivated," she said. We can’t determine if politics motivated the company, but we did wonder whether Hobby Lobby covered the types of birth control at issue in its lawsuit but dropped the coverage before filing its complaint. The short answer: Yes. The Green family, which founded Hobby Lobby in Oklahoma City in 1972, said as much in its original complaint. The Greens re-examined the company’s health insurance policy back in 2012, shortly before filing the lawsuit. A Wall Street Journal story says they looked into their plan after being approached by an attorney from the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty about possible legal action over the federal government’s contraceptives requirement. That was when, according to the company’s complaint, they were surprised to learn their prescription drug policy included two drugs, Plan B and ella, which are emergency contraceptive pills that reduce the chance of pregnancy in the days after unprotected sex. The government does not consider morning-after pills as abortifacients because they are used to prevent eggs from being fertilized (not to induce abortions once a woman is pregnant). This is not, however, what the Green family believes, which is that life begins at conception and these drugs impede the survival of fertilized eggs. At any rate, Hobby Lobby stopped covering those drugs in its plan and took the health care contraceptive mandate to court, represented by the Becket Fund. The only caveat here is Hobby Lobby said it didn’t know it was covering the drugs. "Coverage of these drugs was not included knowingly or deliberately by the Green family. Such coverage is out of step with the rest of the Hobby Lobby’s policies, which explicitly exclude abortion-causing contraceptive devices and pregnancy-terminating drugs," the company stated in its court filing. Of note, company leaders do not have religious problems with other forms of birth control, such as the pill, condoms, diaphragms and sterilization, according to the family’s legal representation, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. Our ruling On CNN, Kohn said, "Hobby Lobby provided this coverage before they decided to drop it to file suit." The Christian-owned company did previously offer insurance plans that included coverage of a few contraceptives at issue in the case, namely morning-after pills, but reports suggest owners weren't aware they offered that coverage. When the company found out -- in the wake of the contraceptive requirements that came out after the health care law -- the company stopped offering the drugs and took the contraceptive mandate to court. Kohn’s statement is accurate but leaves out that Hobby Lobby says it unwittingly offered this kind of birth control coverage. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-11657	"Come February (2018), Americans will see their paychecks grow at the tune of saving $1,000 or more a year."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/10/kayleigh-mcenany/does-newly-signed-republican-tax-reform-law-mean-1/	Are we already just weeks away from getting savings from the new Republican tax law? And will those savings total $1,000 or more per year? That’s the claim Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany made Dec. 27, 2017, five days after the tax overhaul was signed into law by President Donald Trump. McEnany, who was a pro-Trump pundit on CNN during the 2016 presidential election, said it this way on Jerry Bader’s conservative talk show on Green Bay radio: It's exciting to think that come February (2018), Americans will see their paychecks grow at the tune of saving $1,000 or more a year. Is she right? McEnany’s evidence When we asked McEnany for information to support her statement, she told us she was referring to the middle class. But there was no mention of the middle class in her interview up to the point when she made her claim. So, her claim is broad, referring simply to "Americans." McEnany also said her statement was based largely on a PolitiFact National article that identified winners and losers in the tax bill. And she cited a list of 40 companies that say they have given their employees bonuses as a result of the tax law. Sometimes lost in the reporting on the overhaul is that the overwhelming majority of Americans will see tax cuts, starting in 2018 and continuing for at least several years. But, as we’ll see, many Americans -- roughly 40 percent of households -- won’t see cuts as high as $1,000 per year at all. ‘Come February’ We’ll start with McEnany’s reference to February 2018. Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us that because of the law, some Americans likely would see somewhat larger paychecks as soon as February 2018, as employers withhold less money from employee paychecks. That will depend on how quickly the Internal Revenue Service develops new withholding tables and then how quickly employers are able to implement them. Now to the larger part of McEnany’s claim -- paychecks, or at least the take-home portion of paychecks, growing by $1,000 per year. ‘$1,000 per year’ The PolitiFact National article, relying on data from the Tax Policy Center, said the vast majority (about 80 percent) of taxpayers will see tax cuts in 2018. But for Americans on the lower end of the income spectrum -- roughly 40 percent of households -- the average cut will amount to $480 or less. Meanwhile, the richer 60 percent of households will get cuts ranging from $1,090 to $285,490 (for the richest 0.1 percent). Mazur told us those scenarios would remain the same, more or less, through 2025. After that, many of the individual tax cuts go away under the new law -- unless they would be extended by a future Congress. At that point, Mazur said, most taxpayers will be worse off under the new law than if the law it replaced would have remained in place. In fact, by 2027, fewer than one-third of taxpayers in the bottom 80 percent of the income spectrum would see a tax cut. (Experts from the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, the libertarian Cato Institute and the conservative Manhattan Institute also referred us to the Tax Policy Center projections for checking McEnany’s claim.) As for whether more companies will -- as a result of the tax law -- give their employees raises or bonuses -- is, of course, unknown. Our rating McEnany said: "Come February (2018), Americans will see their paychecks grow at the tune of saving $1,000 or more a year." It’s expected that some Americans, though it’s impossible to know how many, will start seeing larger take-home pay from their paychecks in February 2018 as less money is withheld for taxes as a result of the law. Meanwhile, it’s expected that about 60 percent of households will see tax cuts of at least $1,000 per year from 2018 through 2025. But those would largely go away after 2025, when various individual tax cuts in the law expire. As for whether Americans in large numbers will get raises or bonuses -- because of the tax law -- that remains to be seen. McEnany’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.

pomt-10224	"That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/04/sarah-palin/no-bidders-on-ebay-sold-it-offline/	In her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin talked about her record as governor of Alaska. She talked about ethics reform and cutting the state budget. "While I was at it, I got rid of a few things in the governor's office that I didn't believe our citizens should have to pay for," Palin said. "That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay." The state's jet plane was a major issue in the 2006 election, which Palin won. Then-incumbent Frank Murkowski had defied protests from members of the state Legislature and the public when he bought the jet in 2005 to travel around the state. His political opponents said the jet symbolized his arrogance and free-spending ways. Palin defeated Murkowski in the Republican primary and then won the general election. She said during the campaign she would sell the jet, and one of her first orders on taking office was putting the it up for sale. And yep, the state decided to list it on eBay for an asking price of $2.5-million. (The state had paid just under $2.7-million for it in 2005.) It wasn't as wacky as it sounds. The state had sold smaller aircraft previously on eBay. (Alaska is a large, rural state, and state officials do use aircraft to get around. But typically they use smaller, more rugged planes than Murkowski's jet.) But the jet's eBay listing did not prove effective, and the state never got its asking price. Instead, in 2007, the state turned to an aircraft broker, Turbo North Aviation. The jet was purchased that year by businessman Larry Reynolds, the owner of a sporting goods store and marine supply store in Valdez. Reynolds paid $2.1-million. So it's true that Palin put the plane up for sale on eBay, but it didn't sell on eBay. That's not a huge point, but it is worth noting. We rate Palin's statement True.

pomt-01118	"Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/06/facebook-posts/do-all-new-republican-senators-favor-eliminating-f/	In December 2014, some Internet users were passing along links to a story with a striking headline: "Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015." Here’s the text of the story, originally published at a website called the Daily Leak: One hundred percent of newly elected Republican Senators have agreed to vote to eliminate the food stamps program including; Senators Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), David Perdue (R-Ga.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.). "Small businesses and the American people cannot afford President Obama’s countless new regulations and tax increases. There is a right way and a wrong to improve our country’s welfare system, and the President’s policies just aren’t working. We need to put poor people first and lower costs," Senator Gardner said in a statement. Senator Perdue stated on his campaign website that he was one of the millions of Americans who would support free market solutions to feeding the nation. "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is an overreaching federal program that has actually worsened the nutritional standards in this nation and increased costs. I am one of the millions of Americans who wish this program would end. To make matters worse, SNAP benefits are discouraging full-time job creation. We need to repeal the SNAP program and replace it with more affordable free market solutions," Perdue said on his campaign page. The Senators signed a pledge to approve any legislation in 2015 that would completely defund the $78 billion program. In recent years, some conservatives have criticized the growing usage of the program, due largely to higher demand during the Great Recession. Still, suggesting it should be eliminated entirely would be a big deal. The food stamp program, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, has a budget of more than $80 billion. So is the story accurate? 'Satire' sites No, it’s not accurate. The Daily Leak is one of a growing number of websites that run "satire" -- or more accurately, as we’ve noted, fake news. Sites such as the Daily Currant, the National Report, Empire News and others publish plausible-sounding -- but entirely fabricated -- news articles. Buried on the Daily Leak’s hard-to-find FAQ page is a disclaimer: "The Daily Leak is a satirical, parody website. … The Daily Leak uses invented names in all its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental." Interestingly, the quote by Gardner turns out to be rooted in something real -- but the Daily Leak twisted the language from its original purpose. Gardner’s staff pointed us to a news release from when Gardner was serving in the House. It applauded a House vote to approve the Repeal of Obamacare Act, but the Daily Leak changed the news release’s focus from the health care legislation to food stamps by changing the phrase "health care" to "welfare" and "patient-centered care" to putting "poor people first." The popular impact What we’ve seen happen is that these posts go viral, free of any "satire" label, reaping Web traffic and advertising revenue for the site when people unwittingly share them on social media. This certainly happened with the food stamp story. Through Jan. 6, 2015, when we were researching this fact-check, the Daily Leak story had been shared more than 115,000 times on Facebook alone. These posts likely reached many times that number of eyeballs as friends of these Facebook posters scrolled through their news feeds. And many who saw the story had no inkling it was fake. For instance, the website of the Progressive Democrats of America, a coalition of "labor, peace, healthcare-for-all, and justice groups" founded in 2004, re-posted the story without any indication that it was fake. The story was also posted on other political sites, such as Coloradopols.com. When one user at the popular liberal site Democratic Underground posted the Daily Leak item, some commenters warned that it was satire -- but other commenters, even after hearing that, seemed unfazed, saying the Republican Party’s rhetoric on food stamps made it plausible in their mind. "I totally believe they'd do something like that," wrote one user in the Democratic Underground thread. Another wrote, "If it's satire, it sucked me in completely. I saw nothing that would stretch my credulity." A third added, "Even after knowing it's satire, I have a hard time believing it isn't true. These people work tirelessly to cut food stamps. Who is to say they won't try to gut the program?" In late December, Dave Weigel, a political blogger for Bloomberg, expressed exasperation on his Facebook page with both the fake-news sites and the social-media users who are gullible enough to believe their posts -- or who are too lazy to give them the barest level of scrutiny. "I first learned of the Daily Leak story when a very smart economist friend -- seriously, he's smart -- emailed it as a shocking story political reporters should have been on," Weigel told PolitiFact. "He didn't mean it as an insult, but increasingly I think reporters should take fake news that way. This story was bogus, but shared more than 100,000 times, while actual stories about Republicans and entitlements that took sourcing and reporting and the support of news organizations can get ignored." The Daily Leak post, Weigel added, "was written to be shared by liberals who think conservatives are stupid. In sharing it, they said that they didn't really care whether the bad thing they heard about Republicans was true or not. It's incredible that in the age of Google, so many people decline to take the step of double-checking their sources -- or don't search for better articles." Our ruling More than 115,000 social media users passed along a story headlined, "Newly Elected Republican Senators Sign Pledge to Eliminate Food Stamp Program in 2015." But they failed to do due diligence and were snookered, since the story came from a publication that bills itself (quietly) as a "satirical, parody website." We rate the claim Pants on Fire. UPDATE, Jan. 8, 2015: After we published our fact-check, we received a response from Kevin Gallagher of the Daily Leak. We had asked him whether he considers the site’s articles to be political satire. Gallagher responded, "Yes, the site is full of satire, parody, and spoofs, mainly of politics and sports." When we asked why the site’s satire label is relatively inconspicuous, Gallagher said, "Are you familiar with The Onion? Let me know when you find their disclaimer. I'll give you a hint, it's hidden deep down in the FAQ. My site has a much more prominent disclaimer than The Onion, National Report, Daily Currant, or most other similar sites, for that matter." We also asked him his reaction to 110,000-plus people sharing their story on Facebook thinking it was real: "As a teacher, it would please me greatly to see more people fact-checking what they read on the Internet. Unfortunately, when it comes to politics in particular, people often have an emotional reaction to a headline before using any reason to deduce whether it could possibly be true."

pomt-02467	"The budget I managed at the Department of Education was more than $60 million."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/feb/23/clay-pell/rhode-island-gubernatorial-candidate-clay-pell-say/	Clay Pell, the grandson of former U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell is inaugurating his political career by making a run for Rhode Island governor. Part of the challenge of getting hired for the job -- as in any job -- is showing you have the right experience. The issue came up during Pell’s Feb. 2 appearance on the WPRI-TV WPRI-12 program "Newsmakers." In response to a question from host Tim White about his lack of political experience, Pell, a Democrat, argued that he has administrative experience, citing a previous post at the U.S. Department of Education. White noted that, as governor, Pell would have to deal with an $8.5 billion-budget. "What’s the biggest budget you’ve ever managed?" White asked. "The budget I managed at the Department of Education was more than $60 million," Pell said. "The International and World Language Education budget, which I oversaw, was more than $60 million." There's no doubt that Pell served as a deputy assistant secretary in that program. The education department issued a news release announcing his appointment and The Providence Journal published a story when he got the job. But did he really manage a $60-million budget? And for how long? When we contacted Pell's campaign, spokesman Bill Fisher sent us a link to the budget of the Office of Postsecondary Education. He said Pell oversaw the $70.2 million appropriation for international education and foreign language studies, along with the $2.2 million set aside for the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education. Total: $72.4 million. Pell had said the budget was "more than $60 million." We also contacted the Department of Education directly, where spokesman Jim Bradshaw sent us to the same spreadsheet. He directed us to lines 579 to 583 -- the $70.2 million figure. We asked if the $2.2-million line item (line 586) applied as well, as Fisher reported, but Bradshaw didn't get back to us on that. When we went back to the Department of Education again to double-check Pell’s role, we received an email from Martha Kanter, now a senior fellow at the Steinhardt Institute of Higher Education Policy at New York University, who was the under secretary of education during Pell's tenure. While deputy assistant secretary, she said, "he [Pell] oversaw and managed the U.S. Department of Education’s International and Foreign Language Education budget." Seventy million dollars is chump change compared with the $8.5 billion or so that Rhode Island is expected to spend in the next fiscal year. But when Pell says the portion of the Department of Education budget he oversaw was over $60 million, he is correct. But there’s another important element to this claim, which Pell didn’t mention in his TV interview: Pell only held the job from April 16, 2013 through Oct. 18, 2013, according to the education department. In other words, he was overseeing the budget for six months, at the most. If he had been there for a full year so he was implementing the bulk of his budget, we would rate his claim True. But he only actually administered a portion of that budget. That makes his claim technically accurate, but lacking an important mitigating factor. We rate the claim as Mostly True.

pomt-10229	Obama is the Senate's "most liberal."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/03/john-mccain/mccain-ad-misstates-obamas-record/	A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays Republican running mate Sarah Palin as a bold reformer and says Sen. Barack Obama is a liberal who offers little more than "empty words." The ad, known as "Alaska Maverick," begins with the image of a Wall Street Journal article (really an editorial) that is headlined "A reform ticket." "The Journal says: 'Governor Palin's credentials as an agent of reform exceed Barack Obama's,' " the announcer says. "They're right. She 'has a record of bipartisan reform,' " the announcer says, quoting from an Associated Press article. The screen then shows an article from the political magazine National Journal as the announcer says "He's the Senate's 'most liberal.' " The announcer then says that Palin "took on the oil producers" while Obama "gave big oil billions in subsidies and giveaways. She's "earned a reputation as a reformer. His reputation? Empty words." We're previously explored Obama's support of the energy bill that included subsidies for oil companies and we've checked claims about Palin's efforts to oppose oil companies , so here we'll focus on the claim that he's the most liberal senator. Obama-as-lefty has been a trusty Republican talking point since January 2008, when National Journal announced its annual ratings for 2007 had determined he was the most liberal senator. We checked the McCain charge in June with this article, but the charge will be new to many of our readers, so we'll explore it again here. Republican candidates often brand their Democratic opponents as liberals to portray them as candidates who favor big government and high taxes. Linguists who study political rhetoric say Republicans have been so effective at giving the word a negative connotation that many Democrats won't call themselves liberals. They prefer "progressives." Still, many political scientists and journalists use the term to represent the Democratic extreme of the political spectrum, and National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine, uses a liberal-conservative scale for its annual rating of congressional votes. The magazine's editors and reporters choose key votes on major issues and those that they believe exhibit a split between liberals and conservatives, and then calculate how often senators and House members vote each way. They calculate the liberal/conservative votes in three areas — economic, social issues and foreign policy — and then average them for a composite score. The annual rankings generate some publicity for the magazine, especially in election years. In 2004, the magazine said the most liberal senator was Sen. John Kerry, who became the Democratic nominee for president. On Jan. 31, 2008, five days before the Super Tuesday primaries, National Journal published an article headlined "Obama: Most Liberal Senator in 2007." The article said Obama had missed 33 of the 99 votes that were rated but that it was enough for a calculation. The magazine said McCain was not rated because he missed more than half the votes in the economic and foreign-policy categories. Since Obama's rating was announced, McCain and other Republicans have frequently cited it to criticize Obama. Yet other ratings don't show Obama as the Senate's top lefty. He wasn't the top liberal in his two other years in the U.S. Senate according to National Journal . He was 10th-most liberal in 2006 and 16th in 2005. The McCain campaign also cites a 2006 rating by the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action that gave Obama 95 percent, which the campaign noted was the same as Kerry and Sen. Barbara Boxer. But there's a little sleight of hand in that one. Although the McCain campaign is correct that Obama earned a 95 percent rating that year for voting the way ADA wanted, there were 10 senators who got more liberal scores than Obama, including Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Richard Durbin of Illinois. (In the latest ADA rating, for 2007, Obama missed five of the 20 votes the group scored, so he received a 75 percent rating. But he voted the way ADA wanted on each of the 15 votes he attended.) Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists that plots lawmakers on a liberal-conservative scale based on their voting patterns, calculated there were nine senators more liberal than Obama in the current Congress, including Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "Obama is a liberal, but he's not the most liberal," said Keith Poole, a University of California-San Diego professor who runs the site. Ratings from Congressional Quarterly don't measure liberal/conservative votes, but they show Obama is not quite as partisan as other senators. In CQ's calculation of party unity, which measures how often members vote with their party on bills where Republicans and Democrats split, Obama got a 97 percent rating last year. Ten Democrats had higher scores. On votes where President Bush indicated his position, CQ found Obama supported the Republican president 40 percent of the time in 2007, which put Obama in the middle of the pack for Democrats. He supported Bush 49 percent the previous year. If McCain had made a more general statement about Obama's ideology last year, he could have been more accurate. But McCain's statement that Obama is the "most liberal" suggests it is a cumulative rating for all of Obama's time in the Senate. But in fact, it is true for only one rating for one year. Measurements for other years and by other groups show Obama is not the No. 1 liberal — in some cases, far from No. 1. So we find McCain's statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11906	The state and local tax deduction is a major benefit for moderate-income households because "50% of households that claim State & Local Tax deduction make under $100K."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/20/nancy-pelosi/do-moderate-income-families-benefit-more-state-and/	As Congress moved toward consideration of a major tax overhaul, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., raised a warning about one element of President Donald Trump’s proposal -- ending the deduction for state and local tax payments. "This is striking: 50% of households that claim State & Local Tax deduction make under $100K – & now @SpeakerRyan wants to throw it away," Pelosi tweeted on Oct. 12. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Pelosi’s point is that the deduction helps a lot of middle- and lower-income taxpayers, meaning it should be preserved. A reader wrote us to suggest that we take a closer look at this assertion, so we did. We found that Pelosi’s numbers are on target. But the suggestion that this deduction primarily helps lower-earning Americans misses the mark. When we checked with Pelosi’s office, they cited data from the Government Finance Officers Association. A table in the group’s report does indeed say that 54 percent of households that claimed the deduction earned $100,000 or less. But that’s more a reflection of how many households earn $100,000 or less, rather than an indication that the state and local tax deduction is a targeted benefit for lower earners. Lower-income taxpayers are less likely to itemize their tax returns and therefore less likely to benefit from the state and local tax deduction, said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow and director of the state and local finance initiative at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. "But because there are so many more taxpayers in these income groups, they make up a majority of taxpayers claiming it," Reuben said. As Reuben indicated, higher-income households are much more likely to take the deduction than lower-income taxpayers are. But this is only part of the picture. Most other data shows the deduction skewing toward higher-income taxpayers. According to the same report Pelosi’s office cited, between 91 percent and 93 percent of households earning $200,000 and up take the deduction. By contrast, 53 percent of taxpayers with between $75,000 and $100,000 in income used the deduction, and the lower income bands used it at rates significantly less than that. Here’s a summary chart from the report: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Second, the dollar amounts saved through deduction skew heavily toward the upper end of the income spectrum. So, if anything, removing the deduction will disproportionately hurt higher earners. According to the same report, households up to $100,000 in income accounted for about 23 percent of the dollar value of the deduction -- far from the majority implied by the statistic used in Pelosi’s tweet. Indeed, almost 20 percent of the dollar amount saved from the deduction went to taxpayers with more than $1 million in income alone. And the benefits at the upper end of the income spectrum aren’t just larger in an absolute sense, but they’re also bigger as a percentage of the taxpayer’s income. For income bands under $100,000, the amount saved from the state and local deduction ranged from 2 percent to 4 percent of adjusted gross income. But for taxpayers earning $200,000 and up, the percentage saved was 7 percent to 8 percent of adjusted gross income. Here’s the summary chart from the same report. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Part of this stems from the reality that a $1,000 deduction would be worth $396 to someone in the top 39.6 percent tax bracket, while the same $1,000 deduction would be worth $250 to someone in the 25 percent bracket, said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "So not only do the wealthy claim more of the deduction, they get more value for the deductions they do claim," Newton said. When we presented this additional data to Pelosi’s office, a spokesman said that Pelosi’s tweets were intended to remind people that many moderate-income working families do benefit from the state and local deduction -- a reality often overlooked in the debate, he said. "I think you have to note that even the comparatively lower utilization rate in the lower brackets amounts to millions and millions of households losing a deduction that is a pretty big deal in terms of their family budget," said Henry Connelly, a Pelosi spokesman. "Often, that gets lost when you go to the aggregate number of deduction value." Our ruling Pelosi tweeted, "50% of households that claim State & Local Tax deduction make under $100K." The data says that 54 percent of taxpayers who claim the deduction make $100,000 or less. But, in reality, this is a tax deduction that disproportionately benefits higher-income taxpayers -- not the group Pelosi highlighted in her tweet. Pelosi's claim is accurate, but it comes with that caveat. We rate the statement Mostly True. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2017-10-20T17:20:19	2017-10-12	['None']
pomt-11525	"I don’t need a lecture from Kirsten Gillibrand or anybody else who protected and defended and harbored a sitting president who had sexual relations in the Oval Office and was impeached for lying."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2018/feb/16/kellyanne-conway/did-gillibrand-defend-and-harbor-bill-clinton-duri/	Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has emerged as one of the most outspoken members of Congress against sexual assault. But White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway assailed Gillibrand after the senator criticized President Donald Trump on Twitter for hiring Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary who resigned amid allegations of domestic abuse. "I don’t need a lecture from Kirsten Gillibrand or anybody else who protected and defended and harbored a sitting president who had sexual relations in the Oval Office and was impeached for lying," Conway said on ABC’s This Week. Gillibrand has spent years trying to pass legislation to curb sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. Her work coined her the title of the ‘#MeToo Senator’ on CBS’ 60 Minutes recently. Gillibrand also made headlines last year when she said former President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with a former White House intern became public in 1998. Conway accuses the senator of defending Clinton when he was a sitting president. Is there any truth to her claim? Clinton’s impeachment Monica Lewinsky had an affair with Clinton as a White House intern. When the affair was first made public through media reports in January 1998, Clinton denied the affair for several months until he admitted to it on national television in August that year. The House approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton in December 1998. The Senate acquitted Clinton of those charges in 1999. All 45 Democrats in the Senate voted against the impeachment charges at the time. Only seven of the Democrats remain in the Senate today. Gillibrand’s career Gillibrand worked as a lawyer at a Manhattan law firm during Clinton’s impeachment, then accepted a position as special counsel at the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development in 2000. She worked there for the rest of Clinton’s term for Andrew M. Cuomo, who was secretary of the agency at the time. She also volunteered for Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaign that year. Gillibrand announced a run for Congress in 2005 and she was elected in 2006, nearly nine years after Clinton's affair became public. Gillibrand succeeded Hillary Clinton as a U.S. senator representing New York in 2009. We could find no evidence suggesting Gillibrand publicly defended President Clinton while he was in office. Gillibrand and the Clintons But she has been a political ally to the Clintons for almost two decades. Bill Clinton campaigned for Gillibrand during her first run for an upstate Congressional seat in 2006. Three years later, he headlined a fundraiser for Gillibrand after she was appointed to Hillary Clinton's Senate seat. Gillibrand accepted his endorsement for her re-election the following year. Gillibrand donated to Hillary Clinton's campaigns for Senate and helped campaign for her in 2016. Gillibrand appeared publicly with Bill Clinton several times since her first election. She did not publicly condemn the former president’s actions until last year. The White House did not respond to our inquiry about Conway’s claim. Our ruling We could find no evidence that Gillibrand "protected and defended and harbored a sitting president who had sexual relations in the Oval Office and was impeached for lying." Gillibrand was not elected to Congress until 2006. She worked for the Clinton administration briefly in 2000 after the president was impeached. She has been close with the Clintons since her election in 2006, and she did not publicly condemn the former president until last year. We rate Conway’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-08199	Rebuilding three high schools will benefit 40 percent of Portland Public School students.	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/23/carole-smith/portland-schools-superintendent-carole-smith-says-/	The last time Portland Public Schools asked voters to approve a pricey construction bond measure, the money was spread pretty evenly among all district schools. This time, schools superintendent Carole Smith proposes to spend the bulk of the $548 million, if approved, on eight schools, including a top-to-bottom rebuild of Cleveland, Jefferson and Roosevelt high schools. As part of her pitch at a press briefing, superintendent Carole Smith said she chose to focus on high schools, in part, to reach as many students as possible in this first round. (If voters approve, every high school will be updated within 15 to 20 years, and every school within the next 20 to 30 years.) "So high schools were selected on purpose because every student in a cluster will ultimately go to a high school," she said. "So by doing three high schools, we essentially impact 40 percent of the students in the district." Forty percent sounds nice. It sounds large. And it’s an excellent selling point to recession-weary voters who may be struggling with the most expensive local bond measure in state history. Yet, the figure didn’t sit right with some reporters present. The three high schools currently enroll just 2,669 students -- a teeny amount of the district’s 47,000 students, and a figure that translates to 20 percent of enrolled high school students. PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know how Smith got to the higher figure. So we went back to the superintendent’s office. Her spokesman Matt Shelby provided two pieces of information to back up her claim. One, he said his boss meant to include Lincoln High School, since this bond measure would pay for pre-construction planning at the Southwest Portland school. Two, he said Smith reached the figure by including all students in kindergarten through grade 12 eligible to attend one of those four schools. "If you include all students in the Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson and Cleveland clusters, that gives you a grand total of 20,257 and that’s right about 43 percent," he said. Maybe in a theoretical world with theoretical enrollment. The problem is that not all the students in a "cluster" attend that high school. Some enroll in a magnet school such as Benson, a charter school or an alternative school. Even more problematic is the inclusion of the Jefferson cluster -- because there is no Jefferson cluster. Students in the Jefferson attendance area are free to attend another high school of their choice, and three-quarters of students do, whether the schools are on the Phase One rebuild list or not. Anyway, instead of counting cluster numbers, let’s take a look at projected high school enrollment figures to gauge the percentage of students served. (We’ll deal with the addition of Lincoln later.) PPS projections show that by 2014 there would be 12,753 high school students. Of those, Cleveland would enroll, at the high end, 1,361 students; Roosevelt, 1,098 students; and Jefferson, 450 students. That totals 2,909 students, or 23 percent of high school students. By 2019, under a very aggressive growth model, the district estimates 14,565 high school students. Cleveland would have at the high end, 1,590 students; Roosevelt, 1,365 students; and Jefferson, 650 students. That totals 3,605 students, or 25 percent of high school students. Neither of those figures sounds remotely like 40 percent. Now, let’s tackle the question of whether Lincoln should be included in Smith’s calculations. She repeats her argument in a fact sheet disseminated at the PPS site online. "More than 40 percent of PPS students live in the attendance area of the first high schools to be rebuilt under the long-range program: Cleveland, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln." But Lincoln won’t be rebuilt with the money from this bond. Money from this property tax levy will pay only for design work, not for any of the far more costly construction work required for students to see a new high school. Voters will have to approve another facilities bond for Lincoln to be rebuilt. Smith is free to use Lincoln’s "cluster" to sell that levy in another six years, but it smacks of double-dipping to do so now. Take a look at the estimated costs to judge for yourself. The cost to rebuild and redesign Roosevelt is estimated at $82 million to $86 million; Jefferson is $48 million to $52 million; Cleveland is $90 million to $92 million. And Lincoln? A wimpy $6 million. Shelby said that even without Lincoln, the three schools have attendance areas that make up 34 percent of the school district. He maintains that the superintendent’s larger point remains valid: focusing on high schools will affect a greater number of children. "I would argue that ALL students in each cluster would be affected. They ALL would have the opportunity to attend a fully modernized high school. Whether they choose to is another story," he wrote. There are lots of reasons for deciding which schools to rebuild first and we won’t get into those here. But if school officials want to affect the most students by rebuilding three high schools, those schools would be Cleveland, Franklin and Grant. Together, they make up 32 percent of high school enrollment -- still not 40 percent. The superintendent’s remarks clearly were an attempt to sell reporters -- and voters -- on the expansive nature of the expensive bond measure. But we don’t agree with the way Smith reached her number, by using clusters, and we don’t think Lincoln should be included when none of Lincoln will be rebuilt by the proposed bond measure. The school district’s own projections show enrollment at the three rebuilt high schools will make up only a quarter of all high school students. Trying to inflate that number to 40 percent is ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. Comment on this item.	None	Carole Smith	None	None	None	2010-11-23T06:00:00	2010-11-08	['None']
pomt-02980	Teachers were not involved in developing the Common Core State Standards.	false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/21/public-comments-common-core-hearing/teachers-were-not-involved-developing-common-core-/	As Florida surges toward full implementation of the Common Core State Standards, the din is rising from some fronts to pull back. Gov. Rick Scott, whose tea party base offers perhaps the most strident opposition, is listening. In public forums that Scott requested, several critics stepped forward to denounce the Common Core, offering a variety of reasons that range from "federal intrusion" to "data collection." One oft-repeated claim was that "teachers were not involved" in creating the standards that they will have to use in their classrooms. Karen Effrem, co-founder of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition, pointed to an article from the libertarian Heartland Institute that detailed how the Common Core writers were not classroom teachers. The initial work groups did not include many K-12 educators, either, according to lists provided. "Although teachers were allowed to submit comments as the standards were developed, there is no indication that these comments were actually reviewed and incorporated into the final product because only a summary was released to the public," Effrem’s group stated in its Common Core analysis. The criticism had become so prevalent that the Common Core State Standards Initiative, the official organization that organizes the standards, has included it in its "Myths v. Facts" document. The organization flatly rejects that teachers played no meaningful role: "The Common Core State Standards drafting process relied on teachers and standards experts from across the country." There’s plenty of evidence to back that claim. Just ask the participants. Both major national teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, note on their websites and in other communications that they joined the Common Core partnership and had teacher members on several review panels. The AFT provided dozens of teachers to the development and review effort, president Randi Weingarten said. The organizing groups, including the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, "came to us … and asked for teachers to review this," Weingarten said. "In some instances we had extensive revisions and said, if you don’t do these revisions, teachers will not support this." Their involvement started before even the earliest drafts, she said, and continues today with the development of lessons and curriculum resources. "Teachers were involved," Weingarten said. Becky Pittard, a Volusia County elementary math teacher, served on the K-5 math work team of the standards development group. She said she was puzzled by any suggestion that teachers had no voice in the process. "If they say we were not involved, that is not telling the truth," said Pittard, a 22-year veteran educator who has taken a leave from her classroom to help train Florida teachers for the transition to the new standards. Pittard related how she and other teachers worked closely with the primary writers, corresponding via email and working online to improve and correct the draft proposals. "I can tell you the equal sign standard is there because I insisted," she said, referring to a first-grade guideline on understanding the meaning of the symbol. "That was my ‘you have to have that’ standard. There was impact." University of Arizona professor William McCallum, one of the math standards writers, confirmed Pittard’s recollection. Organizers also brought teams of practicing teachers by grade levels to meet with the writers. He called their feedback "detailed, intensive, and influential." "The standards went out for two or three rounds of review to the 48 states who had signed on to the initiative. These states were really our clients, and we paid close attention to their comments," McCallum said via email. "Many states assembled teams of teachers to review our work." Florida did. Deputy chancellor Mary Jane Tappen sent a confidential email to selected teachers in November 2009 expressly for that purpose. "You are receiving this email because you are a trusted and respected expert in your field," Tappen wrote. "Florida must provide input on this very first drafty draft of the Common Core National Standards by December 4. … I will be collecting and compiling all our work into one Florida response." When seeking additional input in March 2010, Achieve -- the group helping to organize the Common Core effort -- received comments from 223 teachers, as well as 69 parents. Our ruling Common Core opponents claimed at a public hearing that teachers were not involved in the creation and development of the standards, or that their comments and feedback weren’t used. Participants in the effort, as well as documents detailing the process, reveal this not to be the case. We find this statement False.

pomt-06088	President Barack Obama "put in place historic fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks to lower costs at the pump and reduce dependence on foreign oil."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/06/barack-obama/ad-says-president-barack-obama-put-place-historic-/	With all eyes on Iowa for the Republican caucuses in the first days of 2012, the Democratic contender for president reminded watchers of his own Iowa win — and what he has done to keep his campaign promises. Obama for America bought banner ads across the home page of the online Des Moines Register on Jan. 3, 2012, with a link to highlights from Obama's 2008 victory speech. Music plays as candidate Barack Obama promises action on health care, taxes, energy independence and the war in Iraq. Between clips, white text across the screen highlights President Obama's policy accomplishments. For example, after candidate Obama declares, "I'll be a president who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all!" the next three screens show an image of him driving a car and the words: "Put in place historic fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks to lower costs at the pump and reduce dependence on foreign oil." We wondered, did Obama do that? New standards Obama has announced new fuel economy standards — more than once — taking part in the bipartisan practice of updating rules in place since the 1970s Arab oil embargo. The most recent update, announced in July 2011, covers cars and light trucks made from 2017-2025, requiring an average of 54.5 miles per gallon in 2025. The year before, a new rule required cars and light trucks combined to get an average of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. (PolitiFact in April 2010 weighed his campaign promise to "increase fuel economy standards," and ruled it a Promise Kept.) But were those changes "historic"? (Which we take to mean in some way unprecedented, or as Merriam-Webster puts it "having great and lasting importance.") "A lot of what Obama's doing is really extending what President Bush started," said Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman for automotive information site Edmunds.com. And President George W. Bush extended work started by his predecessors. Still, Obama's push for the first time will require medium- and heavy-duty trucks to meet fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emission standards, starting in 2014. It's also twice as long as previous plans. Meanwhile, while automakers have so far met boosted standards by updating traditional engines, Anwyl says those relatively inexpensive gains won't carry companies through lofty goals set for the end of the decade. "There has to be some kind of breakthrough, and nobody knows what it's going to be," he said. 'Lower costs at the pump' Will those changes lower costs at the pump, as the ad said? The White House, along with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, argue a family that buys a new vehicle in 2025 will save $8,200 in fuel costs compared with driving a similar one in 2010. Of course, those savings are likely to be offset by the higher sticker prices on the cars themselves, since meeting the 2025 standards will require expensive technology — now in just a few, mostly high-end vehicles, according to Edmunds.com — to be widely used in cars and trucks. How much will prices go up? It's not clear. Edmunds.com reports estimates range from nearly $1,000 to $9,300 per vehicle. EPA and NHTSA say it'll be closer to $1,400 to $2,600 per purchase. So, lower costs at the pump, yes. But lower costs for consumers? That's not a given. Reducing dependence From the origins of fuel economy standards in the '70s, the policy focus has been "energy independence and security," according to NHTSA. Some observers, such as Peter Huber and Mark Mills, authors of a 2005 book The Bottomless Well, have argued that greater efficiency doesn't actually reduce consumption. Instead, lower costs to drive simply stimulate more demand. A Boston Globe editorial this year calls energy independence "a pipe dream," saying that 35 years of such mandates haven't reversed the U.S. demand for oil. They point out highway fuel consumption has grown from 109 billion gallons in 1975 to 175 billion gallons in 2008. Lynda Tran, spokeswoman for NHTSA, points out population growth plays a role in that change. She argues petroleum imports would need to be much higher to meet demand if the average passenger car fuel economy was still at the 1978 standard of 18 mpg and light truck fuel economy was still at the 1979 standard of 15.8 mpg to 17.2 mpg. The last time passenger car fuel economy standards increased significantly was between 1978 and 1983, when it jumped from 18 to 26 mpg. During the same time, consumption dropped, along with imports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, standards didn't change much from 1983 to 2005, and consumption and imports increased — because of an increase in miles driven, Tran said. So the new standards, Tran said, "will reduce oil imports from what they would be if there were no improvements in passenger car and light truck fuel economy." Our ruling The Obama administration has launched new fuel efficiency standards. They're not exactly a break from the past, but they do significantly raise the bar for automakers over the next decade. Fuel costs for new-car drivers will drop, though it's important to point out they'll likely pay more up front for more efficient machines. Meanwhile, past increases in fuel standards have pushed down foreign petroleum imports — though consumption overall is up, partly because there are more of us, and we drive more than we used to.

pomt-09043	Democrats say Chafee wants to tax equipment that enables amputee veterans to drive	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/05/democratic-governors-association/democrats-say-chafee-would-tax-amputee-veterans/	There are few things that tug at the heart strings more than hungry children, students who need textbooks and homeowners struggling to keep their families warm. Except maybe veterans who’ve lost limbs to war. On a Chafee attack website it launched this spring, the Washington, D.C.-based Democratic Governors Association accuses the independent candidate for governor of taking aim at all of them. Here, with spelling errors intact, is what the website said: "Now former-Senator Chafee wants Rhode Island taxpayers to fix the state's budget deficit with a wide-ranging tax on previously untaxed items like textbooks, school meals, heating fuel, and, shockingly, the equiment [sic] that amuptee [sic] veterans need to opperate [sic] a car," it tells readers. PolitiFact Rhode Island has already checked Lincoln Chafee’s claim that putting a 1-percent tax on items that are now exempt from the state’s 7-percent sales tax would generate more than $89 million a year in state revenues. It turned out to be Mostly True. But when we saw the association’s claim that the list of exempt items that Chafee would tax includes equipment that enables amputee veterans to drive, it sounded too strange not to check. The Democratic Governors Association says it pulled the list directly from Chafee’s campaign website. They’re right. The site features a line-item roster of tax-exempt items, along with a calculation of how much revenue each would generate if taxed at 1 percent. Textbooks, school meals and heating fuel are all there. And yes, so is the driving equipment for amputees. When we contacted the Chafee campaign to ask about the claim, they didn’t flinch. Eliminating all sales-tax exemptions is a way to balance the budget and erase Rhode Island’s massive deficit, said campaign manager John R. Pagliarini. OK, but kids and amputees? "Rather than get into a situation where we’re judging one priority over another, we’re saying why don’t we apply it uniformly so it’s equitable, so we’re not pitting one interest or one item against another," Pagliarini explained. The Democratic Governors Association slammed Chafee’s proposal. "The idea of taxing the men and women who have served our country and had an amputation in the course of their service? I couldn’t find a single person that thinks that’s a good idea," said spokeswoman Emily DeRose. But Pagliarini called it "very candid" of the former senator to recognize that the state’s budget problems demand dramatic solutions and said Chafee would undoubtedly revisit the exemptions issue once the state is "back on solid footing." He bristled however at the suggestion that Chafee doesn’t care about veteran’s service. "To say that he doesn’t appreciate the contributions of men in uniform is not fair. His father was a decorated war veteran," Pagliarini said. (Chafee’s father, the late Sen. John Chafee, served with the Marines in World War II and the Korean War.) Chafee’s views on veterans aside, the Democratic Governors Association is correct about whom and what the gubernatorial candidate has proposed taxing. We find its claim True, though we suggest they make better use of spell check next time around. UPDATE: After this item was published, we learned that the driving equipment for amputee veterans would be paid for by the federal government for those injured in the line of duty. In such instances, the veterans are not taxed. However, because the Chafee campaign acknowledges that he would tax all items on a list of exemptions, it does not change the assertion that the former senator would tax the driving equipment. Therefore, the ruling stands.	None	Democratic Governors Association	None	None	None	2010-07-05T06:00:00	2010-07-23	['Lincoln_Chafee', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-05457	At the same time gas prices have increased, "the share of the oil market controlled by speculators has more than doubled over the past 10 years."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/apr/24/bill-nelson/share-speculators-oil-market-has-doubled-past-10-y/	What’s higher: the price of gas, or blame for it? President Barack Obama and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, are among those who say they’ve found the culprit behind $4-a-gallon fill-ups. Nelson vented about "a new brand of oil trader," called a speculator, in an April 16, 2012, POLITICO opinion column. He likened speculators’ marketplace activities to gambling, but gambling that everyone pays for with higher fuel prices. "One statistic is really telling: The share of the oil market controlled by speculators has more than doubled over the past 10 years," Nelson wrote. "At the same time, gas has gone from $1.56 a gallon to an average of $3.90 or more a gallon." His column came the day before Obama announced a plan to increase regulation of the commodities market and strengthen penalties for those who manipulate it. With renewed national attention on these traders, we wanted to know if Nelson’s stat was right, and look at his broader point that speculators are contributing to higher gas prices. * * * Let’s start with a few basics on buying and selling oil. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission releases reports about the commodities marketplace each week. These reports lay out the quantity of contracts -- called "futures" -- for various commodities, including wheat, gold, sugar and crude oil, and what kind of users are holding them. Traditional commercial traders, including airlines and farmers, use the exchange to buy or sell supplies in advance. They want to hedge their risk in an effort to avoid volatile prices down the road. They include oil producers, for example, who want to lock in prices and supplies for delivery at a future date. Noncommercial traders buy and sell futures contracts without using them for business purposes -- they’re in it to make a profit. Nelson called them speculators or middle men. Technically, they’re more like investment banks and hedge funds. "They are making bets on the prices of the physical commodities, but they are not actually buying the commodities," wrote Sheridan Titman, a University of Texas at Austin finance professor, in a blog post. We asked Nelson’s office for evidence to back up his claim that speculation in the oil market has more than doubled over the past 10 years. Using CFTC reports, Nelson’s team compared West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures contracts -- the benchmark for U.S. oil prices -- held by noncommercial traders to commercial traders. By that measure, the share of the market grew from 24.2 percent in 2002 to 56.9 percent in 2012, Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin said. Nelson’s team said these numbers actually downplay the presence of speculators in the marketplace. They also pointed us to testimony from CFTC chairman Gary Gensler that at least 80 percent of trades in the oil market are made by speculators. The Paris-based International Energy Agency, of which the United States is a member, agreed that the share of noncommercial trader has more than doubled but used a slightly different anlaysis. They found that noncommercial traders’ share of long open interest contracts increased 15 to 45 percent from 2000 to 2011, and short open interest grew 13 to 36 percent. The U.S. is unique among regulators worldwide for publishing Commitment of Traders reports. Still, IEA spokesman Greg Frost said, there’s more to consider about the oil market than U.S. crude oil futures. Nelson’s measure does not include the physical market, other oil markets, or Brent derivatives, which are the basis for European oil prices, Frost wrote in an email. Other experts we talked to agreed that Nelson’s numbers were likely incomplete. But they also readily conceded that noncommercial trading has increased dramatically over the last decade. * * * Now for Nelson’s larger point: Are speculators driving up gas prices? We found opinions here run the gamut. "I’m sure that speculative trading in oil has been increasing, but I don’t see any reason why that would push up oil prices," said Titman, the finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin. "There is also a lot of speculative trading in natural gas, and those prices have been falling." Some said Nelson’s use of the word "speculators" is pejorative and "fast and loose." A noncommercial trader is not necessarily a speculator in a negative way, said Lutz Kilian, a University of Michigan economics professor. "The real question is not whether there are many noncommercial traders in the market," he said, "but whether these speculators somehow undermine the functioning of the oil futures market." So far, he said, pointing to a March 2012 study he co-authored, no one has proven that’s the case or adequately defined "excessive speculation." Kilian further objected to Nelson’s claim that speculators have control over the market. "I am not aware of any research study asserting or documenting that noncommercial traders ‘control’ the market," he said. "That's simply the unsubstantiated opinion of the author." Others say the influx of big financial firms in the commodities market has grown too large and is undermining the markets. Yes, speculators fulfill an important role by taking on risk that commercial traders want to shed, said Jim Collura, who handles public policy at the New England Fuel Institute, which represents heating fuel distributors. But the market turns volatile when speculators dramatically outnumbers hedgers and dominate the marketplace, and that’s what is happening now, he said. The noncommercial traders bet more than what the crude is worth, which drives up the price, said Sean Cota, outgoing chairman of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, which represents gasoline stations, convenience stores, and heating oil businesses. "A trader loves volatility," he said. "If the price is the same every day they can’t make money." Information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which conducts independent analyses for the U.S. Department of Energy, chronicled the growth of the crude oil futures contracts. In 2012, the amount of average daily open-interest contracts in crude oil futures in American exchanges was 1,475. That’s nearly three times as many contracts for the same period in 2002, when it was 496. The agency’s analysis warned that a link between volatile energy prices and speculators is unproven despite growing research by scholars and securities analysts. Part of the problem? Most activity goes on in the over-the-counter derivatives market, which is less transparent, so more data is needed. * * * So what else could explain the volatility of gas prices when U.S. supply is up and demand is down? Worldwide supply-and-demand has a lot to do with it, several experts said, pointing to the growing economies of China, India, Russia and Brazil. "China has increased their consumption more than we’ve decreased ours," said James Hamilton, University of California-San Diego economics professor. "My feeling is that a lot of these politicians are deliberately trying to steer that view and putting forward something else that appeals to people’s emotions," Hamilton said. Sheridan Titman called blaming oil speculators "the issue that will not go away" -- in a blog post two years ago. Our ruling Nelson said, "The share of the oil market controlled by speculators has more than doubled over the past 10 years." The number is based on data collected by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But experts told us that measure doesn’t include the entire oil market. Plus, Nelson’s implication is that the rise in noncommercial traders is directly related to the upswing in gas prices over 10 years. That’s a controversial notion, and, as an independent agency pointed out, unproven either way. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2012-04-24T10:53:36	2012-04-15	['None']
pomt-03554	"New Jersey's governor cut $1.6 billion from public education while handing out $2.1 billion in corporate tax breaks, more than the entire previous decade."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/23/new-jersey-state-afl-cio/afl-cio-claims-chris-christie-cut-ed-funding-16b-w/	The attack ad game for New Jersey’s gubernatorial contest in November has a new player. Enter the state AFL-CIO, which has a meme on its Facebook page that links Gov. Chris Christie to big business and paints him as an enemy of education. A meme is an idea or concept shared via social media. The meme declares, "New Jersey's governor cut $1.6 billion from public education while handing out $2.1 billion in corporate tax breaks, more than the entire previous decade," with a prominent picture of a dazed-looking Christie in the middle. The picture may not be the most flattering, but the claims in it are hard facts: New Jersey’s governor did cut education by a significant amount, and his actions have resulted in tax break largesse for businesses. Let’s begin by reviewing the education funding claim. Christie cut education funding, but not by $1.6 billion. The governor made two cuts to education in 2010 totaling about $1 billion to help close significant budget gaps. The New Jersey Education Law Center, a Newark-based school advocacy group, sued, claiming the cuts violated the law for giving aid to school districts, and put at-risk and poor students at an increased disadvantage. Ultimately, a judge agreed with the Education Law Center’s challenge. The judge also found that New Jersey would have needed $1.6 billion to fully fund education in New Jersey in accordance with the state’s funding law, and ordered the state to spend an additional $500 million on public education in poor districts the next year. Bottom line? Christie’s cuts totaled $1 billion. Next, let’s review the claim about corporate tax breaks. New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal think tank, released a report in April that the state has given $2.1 billion in tax breaks and grants to companies during the past three years that Christie’s been in office. That exceeds the $1.2 billion in corporate tax breaks given the entire previous decade, according to figures from the state Economic Development Authority. At the time of the report’s release, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said the group is "simply not credible," and that figures from the EDA show that incentives have created more than 100,000 jobs since 1996. What Drewniak didn’t do, however, was question the accuracy of the numbers in the report. It’s also worth noting that a month before the report came out, Christie told a commercial real estate group that his administration was on target to deliver $2.3 billion in business tax breaks and supports legislation reauthorizing corporate incentives. NJPP used EDA numbers for its study, Deputy Director Jon Whiten said in an e-mail.. Neither Drewniak nor Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts responded to requests for comment. Our ruling A meme on the state AFL-CIO Facebook page claims, "New Jersey's governor cut $1.6 billion from public education while handing out $2.1 billion in corporate tax breaks, more than the entire previous decade." Christie actually cut $1 billion in state aid from education, not $1.6 billion. As for corporate tax breaks, Christie himself has said his administration is on target to deliver $2.3 billion in benefits for business – and that’s nearly double what was handed out in tax breaks in the decade before he took office.

pomt-15078	Says Donald Trump was "forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/	In an effort to take out frontrunner Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidates have pelted Trump with criticism over his multiple trips to federal bankruptcy court. That criticism was on full display in CNN’s Republican debate Sept. 16. Most notably, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina criticized Trump’s history of bankruptcies in his businesses. "You know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money," Fiorina said. "That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times." Trump doesn’t deny that four of his businesses have filed for bankruptcy. He argues, however, that filing for bankruptcy is a common business decision, and he was smart to make the moves when he did. "Hundreds of companies" have filed for bankruptcy, Trump said earlier in the debate. "I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing. I'm in business. I did a very good job." Trump’s four bankruptcies were Chapter 11 reorganizations (named for its location in federal bankruptcy code), which are designed to restructure businesses without shutting them down completely. The purpose is to "save" the business, as opposed to other forms of bankruptcy which would liquidate the company, said Michael Venditto, a partner at the ReedSmith law firm who has extensive experience with Chapter 11. Because they keep coming up, we decided to outline Trump’s four bankruptcies. We also talked to some finance experts, who told us Trump is correct that Chapter 11 reorganization is not always the result of bad business decisions. Bankruptcy 1: The Trump Taj Mahal, 1991 The first bankruptcy associated with Trump was perhaps the most significant in terms of his personal finances, according to news reports at the time. He funded the construction of the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, which opened in 1990. By 1991, the casino was nearly $3 billion in debt, while Trump had racked up nearly $900 million in personal liabilities, so the business decided to file for Chapter 11 reorganization, according to the New York Times. As a result, Trump gave up half his personal stake in the casino and sold his yacht and airline, according to the Washington Post. Bankruptcy 2: Trump Plaza Hotel, 1992 Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in New York for $390 million in 1988. By 1992, the hotel had accumulated $550 million in debt. As a result of the bankruptcy, in exchange for easier terms on which to pay off the debts, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a total of six lenders, according to ABC News. Trump remained the hotel’s CEO, but it was merely a gesture -- he didn’t earn a salary and had no say in the hotel’s day-to-day operations, according to the New York Times. Bankruptcy 3: Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2004 Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004 when his casinos -- including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City and a riverboat casino in Indiana -- had accrued an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to the Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he was still the company’s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that the company represented less than 1 percent of his net worth. Bankruptcy 4: Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009 Trump Entertainment Resorts -- formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts -- was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. After debating with the company’s board of directors, Trump resigned as the company’s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump’s name in licensing. So four Trump companies filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. Is that as big a deal as Fiorina says? Risky business While it would be better to avoid a situation where Chapter 11 reorganization is necessary, filing for bankruptcy can be a "sound business decision" when the company is facing serious financial problems, Venditto said. It’s better than the business shutting down completely. "However, the source of the financial problems varies from case to case," he said. "Sometimes it is the result of circumstances beyond the control of the business. Sometime it caused by poor judgment. More frequently, it is a combination." Trump’s four bankruptcies all happened within the past 25 years. That’s a lot, said Stephen Lubben, a leading expert in corporate finance and professor at Seton Hall School of Law. But to be fair, the gaming industry has been struggling the past few years, he added, and three out of four of Trump’s bankruptcies were tied to casinos. It’s not fair to put all the blame on Trump for the four bankruptcies because he’s acting as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, said Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University. He added that people typically wouldn’t personally blame former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney or investor Warren Buffett for individual failures within their investment companies, Bain Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. "The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space," Levitan said. "These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him." Our ruling Fiorina said Trump was "forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times." While it is accurate that Trump filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy four times, Fiorina’s statement doesn’t tell the whole story. In context, Fiorina’s phrasing suggests Trump was personally responsible for the failures of these businesses, but in reality, much was out of Trump’s control -- such as a struggling casino industry. But Trump is certainly not blameless.

pomt-12460	"Under ‘Trumpcare,’" domestic violence and sexual assault "could be considered pre-existing conditions."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/09/gwen-moore/sexual-assault-domestic-violence-themselves-are-no/	Democrats savaged the Republican legislation, pushed by President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, that would replace Obamacare. "Under ‘Trumpcare,’" U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin declared in a May 4, 2017 news release, "being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault could be considered pre-existing conditions." The claim by Moore, who has talked publicly about being a victim of domestic violence and sexual assault herself, cuts to one of the big fears around health care -- that having something that is considered a pre-existing condition means a person has to pay more for insurance, or could be denied coverage altogether. Typically, this refers to things such as diabetes or cancer. But sexual assault or domestic violence? Obamacare vs ‘Trumpcare’ The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is the 2010 legislation adopted under President Barack Obama. It prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage -- or charging higher premiums -- because a person has a pre-existing medical condition. Under the American Health Care Act (sometimes called "Trumpcare"), insurers would still be prohibited from denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition. The bill was narrowly approved by the House of Representatives and could be changed in the Senate. But in its current form, the bill would give states the option to allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions higher prices. Republicans argue those people would be protected, because those states would have to set up high-risk pools to insure people with pre-existing conditions. But many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans unaffordable. (The day after the House passed the bill, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said he would consider allowing insurers to charge higher prices. But later that day -- in an indication of how politically touchy the issue is -- he backed away from that comment after it drew criticism.) Pre-existing conditions Bloggers claimed that under the GOP bill, sexual assault is a pre-existing condition, which PolitiFact National rated Mostly False. PolitiFact National spelled out what would happen under the GOP bill regarding sexual assault and experts told us that the same would apply to domestic violence. In a nutshell: The bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition. Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition. States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable. Our rating Moore says that "under ‘Trumpcare,’" the Republican replacement for Obamacare, domestic violence and sexual assault "could be considered pre-existing conditions" -- something that could trigger higher insurance prices for those victims. Moore’s claim goes too far. Simply being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault would not mean a person had a pre-existing condition. But it is important to know that conditions stemming from those assaults, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, could. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-06168	Says the Obama administration catches and releases nonviolent illegal immigrants.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/dec/16/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-federal-government-catches-and-rel/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a Republican presidential debate that President Barack Obama's administration has fallen short of enforcing immigration laws. At the ABC News Iowa Republican debate Dec. 10, 2011, Perry said that when he's president, you "will not see a catch-and-release program like this administration has today … where people who are caught who are illegally in this country and because they haven't been caught in a violent situation, they're released … into the general population. That's the problem that we've got in this country." We’d already started reviewing a similar Perry claim. Stumping in New Hampshire with Maricopa County (Ariz.) Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Perry said at a New Hampshire diner Nov. 29, 2011, that "the Obama administration has a catch-and-release policy where nonviolent illegal aliens are released into the general public," ABC News recapped. "My policy will be to detain and to deport every illegal alien that we apprehend," Perry said, according to an NBC News account. "That is how you stop this. And we'll do it with expedited hearings so that millions of illegal immigrants are not released into the general population until a hearing date's set several weeks or months later, as we have now." "Catch and release" sure is catchy. We wondered if Perry's statement accurately describes current practices. Perry’s campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, offered as backup information an Aug. 18, 2011, entry on the White House blog. The entry by Cecilia Muñoz, White House director of intergovernmental affairs, states that for the first time, the Department of Homeland Security has prioritized the removal of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes in the United States. Homeland Security announced that day, the entry says, that officials would be "making sure they are not focusing our resources on deporting people who are low priorities for deportation. "This includes individuals such as young people who were brought to this country as small children, and who know no other home," the entry says. "It also includes individuals such as military veterans and the spouses of active-duty military personnel. It makes no sense to spend our enforcement resources on these low-priority cases when they could be used with more impact on others, including individuals who have been convicted of serious crimes." Muñoz added that the government would be reviewing the "current deportation caseload to clear out low-priority cases on a case-by-case basis and make more room to deport people who have been convicted of crimes or pose a security risk. And they will take steps to keep low-priority cases out of the deportation pipeline in the first place." Her blog entry says such decisions would be based on "common sense guidelines," a phrase that she hyperlinked to a June 17, 2011, memo from the director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, John Morton, urging agency officials to use discretion in deciding which apprehended violators of immigration law should be removed from the country. Morton’s memo urges that particular care be taken with veterans, long-time legal permanent residents, minors, elderly individuals, pregnant or nursing women and individuals here since childhood, among people, though negative factors also should be weighed, including whether individuals pose a risk to national security, are serious felons or known gang members, or have egregious records of immigration law violations. Frazier also guided us to mention of a June 2010 memo from Morton, obtained by Judicial Watch, similarly encouraging ICE officials to apply prosecutorial discretion. From the top, then, it looks like the administration has been focusing on holding and removing illegal immigrants with criminal convictions instead of others, though an attorney for the Migration Policy Institute, which studies the movement of people worldwide, told us that prosecutorial discretion has long been a tool in enforcing immigration laws. Muzaffar Chishti pointed out in an interview that the June 2011 ICE memo is presented as building on previous instructions by officials in five administrations, starting in July 1976, stressing prosecutorial discretion. In this way, Chishti said, Morton was "reinforcing what has been longstanding policy." He speculated that Morton’s 2011 memo was issued because apprehensions and deportations have surged, straining government resources. In testimony prepared for an Oct. 12, 2011, House hearing, Morton said ICE is focused on removing people who pose threats to safety, as well as repeat immigration law violators, recent border crossers and fugitives. ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen later told us by email that in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2011, the government removed over 396,000 individuals, 216,000 of them (55 percent) who had been convicted of a criminal offense. The year before, Chishti told us, 44 percent of nearly 390,000 individuals removed by the United States had a criminal conviction -- up from 33 percent in 2009 and 27 percent in 2008. Put another way, the figures show that more than 40 percent of the illegal residents removed last year had been convicted of no misdeeds outside of immigration violations. A twist: Most U.S. deportation cases of late were not built around potential deportees’ criminal convictions, according to a review by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The clearinghouse said in a Dec. 5, 2011, online post that from July through September 2011, 13.8 percent of individuals in deportation proceedings were targeted based on criminal activities — down from the "already low level of 16.5 percent" in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2010. The share of individuals facing deportation based on criminal activity "has been declining steadily throughout the past year," the clearinghouse said. ICE’s Christensen called TRAC’s analysis "wildly misleading," saying the immigration agency is not required to bring up an individual’s criminal record, if any, in removal proceedings. She said: "In these cases, an individual's criminal history, while relevant to ICE's decision to seek removal, is largely irrelevant to the legal question of whether the person has a right to remain in the U.S." Our ruling Perry’s statement oversimplifies the administration’s focus on detaining and deporting certain violators of immigration law over others. In fact, people removed from the country on Obama’s watch include both individuals convicted of crimes and those with clean records aside from immigration violations. That said, a majority of the removed detainees last year had a criminal conviction and the share of deported individuals separately convicted of crimes has been on the rise.

pomt-14438	Says Donald Trump "bans disabled veterans from his high rise."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/mar/08/conservative-solutions-pac/pro-marco-rubio-pac-says-donald-trump-bans-disable/	A PAC supporting Marco Rubio says Donald Trump mistreats those less fortunate than him -- including disabled veterans. Trump "bans disabled veterans from his high rise," states the ad by the Conservative Solutions PAC. The ad has aired in San Francisco and multiple markets in Florida, including Miami and Tampa. Did the New York billionaire give the boot to disabled veterans from his high rise? No, he didn’t do that. Instead, he wanted to ban disabled veterans who were given special licenses to peddle from selling their wares in front of his high rise. "It is simply not true and a misrepresentation of the facts in every way," Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told PolitiFact Florida. A few days after the ad started running on TV, the PAC changed the wording of the line about veterans. We are putting the ad’s original claim on the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain how and why the PAC tweaked the wording. Trump’s Fifth Avenue high rise Trump wanted to get rid of street vendors around the Trump Tower, a 68-story condo and retail building on Fifth Avenue. The ad shows a Jan. 28, 2016, headline from the Daily Beast: "Donald Trump wanted vets kicked off Fifth Avenue." (A spokesman for the PAC referred PolitiFact to the Daily Beast article and the New York Daily News article cited within it.) Peddling exemptions for disabled veterans have a long history in New York. First approved by the state in 1894, the exemption allowed disabled veterans to peddle on any commercial street or park throughout the state. In 1991, the state Legislature took up a bill to amend the law. Most peddling was prohibited on Fifth Avenue -- but 176 disabled veterans still had permission to peddle there. Trump wrote a letter to John Dearie, then-chairman of the state Assembly’s Committee on Cities, according to the New York Daily News: "While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax-paying citizens and businesses?" Trump wrote. "Do we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the world’s finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area?" In July 1991, New York City Mayor David Dinkins announced that an agreement had been reached with the Fifth Avenue Association, which represented hundreds of businesses. The businesses would offer disabled veterans jobs at twice the minimum wage, and the association would set up a fund to pay for job training, education or to move vendors to other parts of the city. The next month, then-Gov. Mario Cuomo signed a bill to repeal the peddling, but only for four years. In 1995, when the bill was up for renewal, the Legislature struck a compromise that banned peddling from Midtown Manhattan but included a plan to allow it in other zones to be defined later. Months later, some veterans continued to peddle in the banned area. In 2004, Trump complained about the vendors in a letter to then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. "Whether they are veterans or not, they (the vendors) should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street," Trump wrote, according to the New York Post. Trump wrote that business owners had to repeatedly clean up debris left as a result of the vendors. "Frankly, I have no idea how they can be doing business with the mess they have outside their front door," he wrote. "Fifth Avenue’s comeback is going to be a short one if this situation is not corrected immediately." In response to his letter, a small group of protesters waved signs in front of Trump Tower that read, "Vendors to Trump: You're Fired!" and "Why can't vets vend on streets we die to protect?" We told the PAC’s spokesman that the ad could cause viewers to wrongly assume that Trump wanted to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. "Ad didn’t mention living," Jeff Sadosky replied. PAC changes ad After we started our fact-check, the PAC changed the wording of the ad. The original ad started Feb. 26, according to the Political TV Ad Archive, a website that tracks campaign ads and partnered with PolitiFact and other fact-checkers. On Feb. 29, Factcheck.org wrote that the ad was "miseading" and left out crucial details. By that date, the ad had aired at least 135 times in the Miami, Tampa and Orlando markets. PolitiFact first contacted the PAC about the ad on Feb. 29 and then later noticed on TV that the script had changed. The original ad said that Trump "bans disabled veterans from his high rise." But the new version said that Trump "bans veterans from in front of his high rise." Sadosky said the PAC changed the ad on March 1 "to be more specific." Our ruling A pro-Rubio Super PAC said Trump "bans disabled veterans from his high rise." The TV ad is misleading because viewers could assume that Trump tried to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. His beef was with street vendors including disabled veterans who were given special vendor licenses selling wares around his Trump Tower. Nothing in the ad makes it clear that this related to vendors selling on the street. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bddef00e-4444-4749-a76b-f53a4a0967ea	None	Conservative Solutions PAC	None	None	None	2016-03-08T13:15:41	2016-02-26	['None']
pomt-10288	On Obama, "The press warns the 'Taxman Cometh.'"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/15/john-mccain/the-distortions-cometh/	Taking a page out of recent Obama campaign ads, the McCain campaign released a TV ad on Aug. 15 called "Taxman" that cites items from three newspapers to bolster its argument that "Obama's new taxes could break your family budget." Exhibit A: The announcer says: "The press warns the 'Taxman cometh.'" On the screen is a footnoted citation, "Wall Street Journal 'Taxman Cometh' 7/01/08." This comes from an editorial, not a news story. Here's a fuller context: "Ours is the only industrialized country that taxes its citizens even if they live overseas. That hasn't been a big problem as long as U.S. tax rates have been relatively low. But with Barack Obama promising to raise rates to French-like levels, this taxman-cometh policy could turn Americans into the world's foremost fiscal prisoners." We think it's misleading to cite an editorial from one of the country's most conservative large paper editorial boards and present it as "the press." Obama would increase the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. So there's no argument that for the wealthiest Americans the taxman cometh under Obama's plan. But there would be no change in tax rates for families with an adjusted gross income of less than $250,000. Translation: most Americans. Obama also would increase capital gains and dividend taxes rates from 15 percent to 20 percent for those who make over $250,000. Obama also proposes a $1,000 tax credit on income for working families ($500 for singles), to offset payroll taxes. In its response to the ad, the Obama campaign cites a host of stories and editorials from major newspapers and political Web sites that conclude Obama's plan would result in a tax cut for most middle class Americans. There's even an opinion piece by Jason Furman and Austan Goolsbee in the Wall Street Journal that concludes, "Overall, Sen. Obama's middle-class tax cuts are larger than his partial rollbacks for families earning over $250,000, making the proposal as a whole a net tax cut and reducing revenues to less than 18.2% of GDP -- the level of taxes that prevailed under President Reagan." Exhibit B in the McCain ad, "Obama's taxes mean 'higher prices at the pump' comes again from another editorial, this time from the Washington Post. The editorial speaks to Obama's call for a windfall profits tax on oil companies. "That cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production, lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders, and higher prices at the pump -- thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help," the editorial states. The Obama campaign says this fails to note Obama's call to use the windfall profits tax to support a $1,000 emergency energy rebate to help offset the high cost of gas at the pump as well as the expected rise in home heating costs this winter. Lastly, Exhibit C: "Obama's taxes a 'recipe for economic disaster.'"' This is another citation from a conservative editorial board, this one from the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "He wants to raise the tax rate on the top income bracket from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, nearly double the tax rate on capital gains and dividends, and eliminate all tax breaks for the gas and oil industries and private equity firm managers. Talk about a recipe for economic disaster." The announcer in the McCain ad concludes: "Higher taxes. Higher gas prices. Economic disaster." We at PolitiFact have looked repeatedly at McCain's blanket claims that Obama's plan would translate to "higher taxes" and have found them misleading. As in this case, the ads never seem to note that the tax increases would only be on the wealthy. But our primary gripe here is with an ad that deceptively tries to lend its message an air of credibility by claiming that it comes from an independent voice, "the press." This is becoming more commonplace, particular with the Obama campaign as we explore in this story. We examined an Obama ad that uses news citations and concluded that it was Half True. With MCain, there is a kernel of truth to the claim, in that editorials are part of the press, but voters clearly understand the difference between news reports and articles of opinion. Opinions make the political world go around, but the point is that there are many points of view about Obama's and McCain's tax plans and to present three editorials - two from historically conservative editorial boards - as the voice of "the press" is going too far. For those reasons, we rate the ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04524	Says President Barack Obama "already passed all these Obamacare taxes. About a dozen of them hit middle-income taxpayers."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/02/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-dozen-obamacare-taxes-hit-middle-cl/	During the Sept. 30, 2012, edition of Fox News Sunday, Paul Ryan took a shot at Barack Obama for raising taxes. "We don't think that imposing new taxes on anybody is a good idea. Don't forget, Chris, the only person running for president who's proposing higher taxes is President Obama. … " Chris Wallace, the host, then interjected, "Because he would end the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy." Ryan continued, "Yeah, tax rates -- he already passed all these Obamacare taxes. About a dozen of them hit middle-income taxpayers, breaking that promise. He's proposing a massive tax increase on job creators in January." PolitiFact has already given Obama a Promise Broken for saying, "I can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes." But we hadn’t checked this specific claim, so we’ll do that here. Are they taxes? When we asked a Ryan spokesman for the taxes he was including, he referred us to a Web page put together by the House Ways and Means Republican staff. The list of tax increases in Obama’s health care law is pretty similar to a list of 19 that we published in January in a check of a claim by the Romney campaign. The Ways and Means list marks the tax increases that affect "middle-income taxpayers" with an asterisk. We’ll list those 12 provisions here, with a brief summary of what they would do. As you’ll see, many of these are new taxes, some of them primarily hit the middle-class, others hit certain people within the middle class (along with other people not in the middle class), and others are debatable. (1) Imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of branded drugs, based on each company’s share of the total market. It took effect on Jan. 1, 2011. (2) A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. This tax is narrowly targeted at tanning bed users, but it is still a tax. This took effect July 1, 2010. (3) Annual fee levied on health insurance providers, based on each company’s share of the total market. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. (4) A 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. (5) Limiting the amount taxpayers can deposit in flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. (6) Raise the 7.5 percent adjusted gross income floor for the medical expenses deduction to 10 percent. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. (7) Impose a fee on insured and self-insured health plans to fund the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2013. (8) Increase the tax on distributions from a health savings account or an Archer medical savings account that are not used for qualified medical expenses. Already in effect. (9) A tax penalty on companies with more than 50 employees that do not offer "adequate" health insurance coverage for their employees. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2014. (10) A mandate for individuals to buy health insurance, with limited hardship exceptions. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2014. (11) A 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided "Cadillac" health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2018. (12) Increased penalty for purchasing disallowed products with health savings account. Already in effect. In our prior review of Obama’s 19 tax increases, we relied on this operational definition, offered by Joseph D. Henchman of the Tax Foundation: "Taxes have the primary purpose of raising revenue for general government. Fees have the primary purpose of raising revenue for a specific benefit to the payer. Penalties have the purpose of imposing criminal sanction, and any revenue generation is incidental." Under this definition, along with our discussions with tax experts, we feel comfortable that Ryan, at the very least, has a strong case for eight tax increases in Obama’s health care bill. (See Nos. 1 through 8 on our list.) Three of these have already taken effect, and the other five are set to take effect in about three months. Categorizing No. 9 and No. 10 -- the employer and individual mandates -- is tricky. The question of whether the individual mandate is a tax was at the center of the Supreme Court’s decision that upheld the law this past summer. Shortly after the justices’ decision came down, we ruled that Romney was Mostly True when he characterized the Supreme Court decision as saying the individual mandate "is a tax." However, what kept it from a full True rating was the view expressed by several legal experts that the court ruled that the mandate acts like a tax, or is analogous to one, but not that it is one -- a small linguistic distinction, but an important legal one. These two, in other words, could go either way. No. 11, the "Cadillac tax," has two problems. First, it’s not scheduled to take effect for another five years. More importantly, there is evidence that a significant share of the revenue from this provision may come not from the penalty itself, but from companies shifting their compensation from health coverage (which is not taxed) to wages (which is taxed). Jonathan Gruber, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has provided health care policy advice to both Obama and Romney during his governorship of Massachusetts, estimated this using Joint Committee on Taxation data for an early version of the health care bill. He found that penalty revenues would total $201 billion from 2013 to 2019, compared to wage increases of $313 billion. "If paying higher wages instead of paying for health benefits is a tax increase, then the definition of tax increase is being stretched beyond recognition," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Finally, No. 12 does not strike us as a tax at all. No. 12 -- excluding the costs for over-the-counter drugs not prescribed by a doctor from being reimbursed tax-free through a flex spending plan or medical savings account -- strikes us as more like the kind of decision made by regulators than lawmakers responsible for writing the tax code. Lots of purchases still qualify, and plan participants can simply purchase other items to get reimbursed by their plan. Do they "hit middle-income taxpayers"? For the most part, yes -- but not exclusively. First, we should note that not all of these taxes are imposed directly on individuals. Some are taxes on health insurance companies, drug companies or medical device manufacturers. We’re making the assumption here, as many economists do, that these taxes are ultimately passed on to the customer through higher prices, rather than absorbed by the company. Second, Ryan has excluded a number of other tax provisions in the health care law that are clearly not aimed at middle-class taxpayers, such as taxes that only hit earners above a certain income level, or those aimed at health-insurance CEO compensation. Most of the rest, we think, will hit some, or even many, members of the broad middle-class. However, it’s worth noting that some of these taxes are narrowly focused. Most people use some brand-name drugs or have private health insurance. But someone who doesn’t use tanning booths won’t get hit by the tanning tax, and those who don’t have medical savings accounts won’t get hit by other new tax hikes. Ryan’s language suggests that a typical middle-class taxpayer is getting hit by a dozen new taxes; in most cases the actual number of new taxes will be smaller. Our ruling Ryan said Obama "already passed all these Obamacare taxes. About a dozen of them hit middle-income taxpayers." We find that only eight of these measures are taxes, and in some cases the taxes are imposed on health insurance companies, drug makers and health device manufacturers, not on individual taxpayers. He can make a less-persuasive case for another three measures actually being tax increases. Finally, there will be a substantial variation in how many new taxes affect the middle class. The typical person will not be paying anywhere close to a dozen new taxes. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-10-02T19:06:27	2012-09-30	['Barack_Obama']

He accused major media networks of covering Khizr Khan’s remarks — accusing Republican nominee Donald Trump of not reading the Constitution — live, but not covering Patricia Smith, the mother of Benghazi victim Sean Smith, live. "Nobody covered those (Patricia Smith’s) remarks live but almost everybody covered Khan's, Mr. Khan's remarks live," Kilmeade said. That’s wrong. We looked through television programming from both events using a recording service that chronicles and time-stamps live television programming. Here’s what we found. What aired Smith’s speech, on the first night of the Republican National Convention July 18, 2016, began around 8:24 p.m. ET. The speech was aired live by both CNN and MSNBC. It was not live on Fox News, coincidentally. Fox News went to commercial right before Smith took the stage and returned to a phone interview between Donald Trump and Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. Lou Dobbs Tonight on the Fox Business channel had footage of the speech, but no audio. The broadcast networks, NBC, CBS, ABC and FOX, did not cover any convention programming before 10 p.m. ET. Khan’s speech aired at 9:13 p.m. ET on July 28, 2016, from Philadelphia. Again, it was aired live by CNN and MSNBC but not Fox News. Fox News was in a commercial when Khan began speaking. The cable network showed pictures of Khan speaking on the side but did not have audio. When Fox News returned from the break, it went to a press conference on ISIS by FBI director James Comey. C-SPAN also covered both speeches live. A Fox News spokeswoman did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Kilmeade said "nobody" aired Patricia Smith’s remarks live, but "almost everybody" covered Khan’s remarks live. CNN, MSNBC and C-SPAN covered both speeches live. Coincidentally, Fox News — of which Kilmeade is an employee — covered neither live. Point being: the speeches were covered the same. Kilmeade’s statement rates Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fb15c5db-ef84-4542-8265-735674c9eaf5	None	Brian Kilmeade	None	None	None	2016-08-01T18:04:49	2016-08-01	['None']

Orrin Hatch and said it came from basketball star Shaquille O’Neal. The Dec. 10 headline includes an awkwardly worded alleged quote by the basketball star: "Shaquille O’Neal says: ‘Trump is possibly the best president of the president of all times ever, he is not afraid to...’ Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that O’Neal made that statement. The story started with a quote by Hatch that Trump had "been one of the best presidents" he ever served under. That was followed by a supposed quote by O’Neal: "I don’t pay much attention to his tweets. I’ll say this for you. He’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under. And the reasoning is, he’s not afraid to make decisions. He’s not afraid to take on the -- the big mouths around here." In reality, a video of Hatch showed that he was the one who made that statement after he was asked about Trump’s tweets in November. (Hatch, a Utah Republican, announced Jan. 2 that he will not seek re-election.) We did find real examples of O’Neal talking about Trump optimistically. Before the 2016 election, O’Neal referred to Trump as his friend but suggested he tweak his language. "I think if he could reword some of the things he says and put it in business form, it would really make sense," O’Neal said, according to a video posted in 2015. "Donald is like a straight-up guy." In November 2016 after Trump won, O’Neal said on TNT that "everyone was in shock" about the outcome but that he hoped Trump would bring people together. "It’s kind of hard to believe that a guy with no political experience is the president of the United States," O’Neal said, calling for the public to give Trump a chance to do his job. We sent a message to Pro Conservative News on Facebook and did not get a reply. The headline stated that O’Neal said Trump "is possibly the best president." This fake news story appeared to take a quote from Hatch and attribute it to O’Neal. It was Hatch who said of Trump "he’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under."

pomt-05614	"It was found unconstitutional to drug test elected officials because it prevents us, as citizens, from having that First Amendment right."	false	/florida/statements/2012/mar/27/jimmie-t-smith/florida-rep-says-lawmakers-protected-first-amendme/	Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen torched Florida lawmakers for passing a drug-testing bill for state workers that excluded one class of government employees: elected officials who passed the law. Hiaasen took particular issue with the proposal’s House sponsor Rep. Jimmie Smith, a Republican from Lecanto, and his explanation for a failed attempt to require drug tests for Gov. Rick Scott and legislators. "It was found to be unconstitutional to drug test elected officials because it prevents us, as citizens, from having that First Amendment right," Smith said. The defense was novel -- and also wrong. It turns out Smith confused elected officials with candidates, misinterpreted Supreme Court case law and cited the wrong amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Here's what you need to know. The drug-testing bill signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott on March 19, 2012, allows state agencies to randomly test no more than 10 percent of their workforce every quarter. An employee who fails a test could be fired on the first offense. Scott said he will hold off implementing the new law until the outcome of an ACLU-led court challenge to Scott’s 2011 executive order requiring random drug testing at agencies, an issue the Legislature tried to correct through law. Democrats hurled pointed questions at Smith during a February committee hearing on HB 1205, including why he would not favor drug-testing elected officials. "Are you saying with your bill you are not in favor of making elected officials have drug tests?" asked Rep. Joe Abruzzo, D-Wellington. "Our bosses, our constituents, want it and we should do it," Smith said, explaining he paid $40 for a drug test after a constituent asked him to do it. "So would you be open to amending your bill?" Abruzzo asked. "No," Smith said. "Why not?" Abruzzo said. "Because it is succinctly decided by the U.S. Supreme Court that drug-testing elected officials would violate the First Amendment right of freedom of speech by being elected," Smith said. We called Smith for more information. He said he was referencing Chandler vs. Miller, a 1997 Supreme Court decision that overturned a Georgia law requiring candidates for state office to prove they passed a urinalysis drug test within 30 days of qualifying for the ballot. Passing it in 1990, Georgia was the only state with such a law. Two lower courts had ruled with the state, finding that the drug tests were okay because of the substantial trust voters hold for their elected officials in terms of safety, economic well-being and law enforcement. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in an 8-1 vote, overturned those rulings in a suit brought by Libertarian lieutenant governor candidate Walter Chandler (the defendant, Zell Miller, was governor of Georgia), arguing the drug-testing requirement violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure. "However well-meant, the candidate drug test Georgia has devised diminishes personal privacy for a symbol's sake," wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the majority opinion. "The Fourth Amendment shields society against that state action." The law was not a response to a legitimate public safety concern about drug use among political candidates, Ginsburg continued, which might make blanket drug-tests permissible. The court did not factor the First Amendment into its decision, even though the Libertarian candidates-turned-plaintiffs tried. They argued the drug tests violated their First, Fourth and Fourteenth amendment rights in their initial district court filing. "If you refuse to take a drug test," Chandler argued, according to a 1997 USA Today account, "it's like refusing to salute the flag of the drug war. For Libertarians, it's also like Georgia is saying: 'You can believe what you want. But you have to show contempt for what you and other Libertarians believe before you can even get on our ballot.' " So to recap: The Supreme Court tossed out a drug-testing requirement for candidates -- not elected officials -- based on the Fourth Amendment, not the First. The law wasn't tossed out on the grounds that they were candidates -- rather it was ruled invalid because it diminished someone's personal privacy. We consulted First Amendment expert and attorney Patsy Palmer to be sure we weren’t missing something. "There is nothing that I know of which would extend First Amendment privileges exclusively to lawmakers in the field of urine testing," she said. "There’s utterly no case law on that as far as speech is concerned." She added: "Anything that would give an exclusive First Amendment right to lawmakers rather than other citizens of the state seems to be a stretch." We should note the ACLU, which has strongly suggested it will sue over Smith’s law, agrees that lawmakers should not be drug-tested. But not because of the First Amendment. The group thinks state employees -- and elected officials -- should be protected by the Fourth Amendment. "If the Fourth Amendment applies in the halls of the Florida House of Representatives -– and it does –- it applies to other state office buildings as well," said ACLU spokesman Derek Newton. Smith, for his part, told PolitiFact Florida that the question about lawmaker drug-testing is irrelevant. Per state law, leaders of the state House and Senate are already allowed to "adopt rules, policies, or procedures for the employees and members of the legislative branch" for drug tests. The outcome of the ACLU’s legal challenge to Scott’s drug-testing executive order remains to be seen. It’s likely to influence implementation of the state’s new law. We’re not here to make that case. Our ruling Smith made the claim that elected officials have a special First Amendment protection from being tested for drugs. No court has gone close to that far. In a Georgia case, the Supreme Court ruled that candidates for office -- not elected officials -- cannot be forced to take a drug test because it violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution -- that’s not the one dealing with freedom of speech. Opponents to Florida's drug-testing law say the Fourth Amendment protects elected officials, candidates and state workers from being require to be tested for drugs. While that issue will likely be settled in the court system, Smith's claim can be decided by the Truth-O-Meter. It's False. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the 2012 election season.

pomt-05214	"When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs, a rate twice the national average."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/08/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-manufacturing-jobs-fared-wors/	President Barack Obama’s campaign took aim at Mitt Romney’s economic record as governor of Massachusetts in a television ad released June 4, 2012. The campaign is paying a reported $10 million to air the ad in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. One of the claims: "When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs, a rate twice the national average." We'll examine this claim in two parts: Are the numbers right? And is Romney to blame? We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data. We looked at state-level, seasonally adjusted data for manufacturing jobs during Romney’s tenure, which ran from January 2003 to January 2007. Over that period, Massachusetts manufacturing jobs declined from 336,000 to 298,200 -- a difference of 38,000 jobs. It’s not 40,000, but it’s close. As for the second part of the claim -- the rate of decrease -- Massachusetts manufacturing jobs fell by 11.3 percent over the four-year period. The drop for the nation was 5.8 percent. That means the Massachusetts decline was nearly twice that of the nation as the ad claimed. So the Obama campaign is right on the numbers. But is Romney to blame? What happened before and after Romney? In supporting material for the ad, the Obama campaign argues that Romney’s manufacturing-employment record in Massachusetts represents a departure from the four-year periods before and after his tenure. In the four years before Romney took office, the manufacturing job decline was slightly outpacing the national rate, down 16.7 percent in Massachusetts compared with a national rate of 14.7. After Romney, the Massachusetts decline was 15.1 percent vs. 17 nationally. The Obama camp has a point that Massachusetts’ decline only diverged significantly from the national rate during Romney’s tenure. However, looking at the numbers before and after Romney’s term also reveals that the manufacturing job loss under Romney (11.3 percent) was slower than it was in either the previous four-year period (16.7 percent) or the successive four-year period (15.1 percent). This weakens the Obama campaign’s argument. Who gets the blame? This is an issue we've addressed often with governors from many states. As we’ve noted before, economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively modest impact on a state's economy. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) The Obama campaign points out that in 2005 and 2006, Romney vetoed spending allocations to the Massachusetts Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a state- and federally funded organization that aids smaller manufacturing companies. However, as the Obama campaign also acknowledges, the Democratic controlled legislature overrode Romney’s veto and restored funding to the partnership. So while Romney’s vetoes may show something about the then-governor’s opinion of public-private efforts to boost the manufacturing sector, they don’t speak to the claim we’re checking, which addresses job growth on his watch. Once funding was restored, Romney received "credit" in the job statistics for any employment impact that the partnership may have fostered. The long-term decline of manufacturing Manufacturing -- for a variety of reasons, ranging from the expansion of free trade to patterns of educational attainment to the emergence of new sectors such as information technology -- has nosedived throughout the nation during the past 50 years. Here's how manufacturing’s share of private sector jobs has declined every 10 years over the past half-century: 1962: 33 percent 1972: 29 percent 1982: 24 percent 1992: 19 percent 2002: 14 percent 2012: 11 percent The numbers for Massachusetts look similar (data is only available since 1990): 1992: 16 percent 2002: 11 percent 2012: 8 percent Our ruling The Obama campaign’s numbers check out: Manufacturing jobs did decline at a steeper rate on Romney’s watch than they did nationally. Still, it’s a stretch to lay at Romney’s feet the decline of manufacturing jobs in Massachusetts. His policies had a relatively small impact compared with the decades-long trend beyond the control of any politician. And the rate of decline under Romney was actually slower than it was before and after he took office. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-07723	Says the state share of Texas public education spending increased 82 percent over the past decade, reaching $20 billion in 2009.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/03/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-states-public-school-spending-incr/	Gov. Rick Perry says the state’s public schools are improving -- in part, he suggested, because state aid is way up. "Over the past decade," Perry said in his Feb. 8 State of the State address, "the state’s share of public education spending increased from $11 billion per year to $20 billion in ‘09. That’s an 82 percent increase." Our first pass at his analysis proved a snap after reaching the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. Its staff spokesman, John Barton, said the board shared spending figures with Perry before his speech. Separately, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to a chart showing that in 2000, state aid totaled around $10 billion and the board’s 2008-09 "Fiscal Size-up" projected the aid to be about double that in 2009. Barton said the state spent $11.1 billion on public education aid in 2000. According to LBB staff, the state spent $20.3 billion on such aid in 2009--$9.2 billion, or 84 percent, more than before. What drove the increase? More students, for starters. Texas public schools served more than 4.8 million students in 2008-09, the Texas Education Agency says -- 20 percent more than in 1998-99. What else? School finance expert and lobbyist Lynn Moak, whose clients include a consortium of the state’s largest school districts, said other factors that boosted state aid between 1998-99 and 2008-09 included legislated increases in teacher pay and health care coverage, supported by increasing local tax revenue driven by surging property values. Moak said another major factor driving state aid was the 2006 decision by GOP lawmakers and Perry to mandate lower school property taxes and make up the difference in lost revenue going forward. According to LBB research, nearly $18.6 billion in state aid went to the schools in 2008 compared with $12.1 billion in 2006, before the tax swap took effect. Meanwhile, local funds spent on public education dropped slightly to $18.2 billion in 2008, compared with $19.9 billion in 2006. All told, school spending (from federal, state and local funds) amounted to nearly $41 billion in 2008. But school districts in 2008-09 also had more money to spend per pupil, according to TEA calculations included in year-by-year pocket guides to school statistics. In 1998-99, operating expenditures averaged $5,668 per pupil. Adjusting for inflation, that amount would have been about $6,720 by 2008-09. The actual per-pupil operating expenditure was $8,572, the TEA says. The guides reminded us of another way to size up state spending on public education: by comparing it to the total spent from all sources, meaning local, state and federal funds. According to the guides, the state picked up 46 percent of school districts’ spending in 1998-99. That share was less than 43 percent in 2008-09. During Perry’s decade as governor, the state’s portion hit a low of 34 percent in 2005-06 and a high of 45 percent in 2007-08. So, the state spent 84 percent more money in 2008-09 than before and per-student spending from all funding sources also was higher. Yet the state’s share of education spending -- a telling indicator of state support for the schools -- was down from what it was a decade earlier. We contacted Perry’s office about these aspects. Frazier said the governor stands behind his speech statement. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-03-03T10:12:02	2011-02-08	['Texas']
pomt-09444	"Nearly all of the top 50 prescribers of oxycodone in the United States are in Florida."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/09/jeff-kottkamp/kottkamp-top-50-oxycodone-prescribers/	Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, who is seeking the Republican nomination for attorney general, is highlighting the abuse of prescription drugs as a key issue in his statewide campaign. Kottkamp wrote a column that was published in newspapers across the state detailing the severity of the problem in Florida. "An average of six Floridians die each day from a prescription drug overdose — five times as many deaths as from all illegal drugs combined," he wrote in article published Feb. 28, 2010. "In fact, the number of drug overdose deaths in Florida increased by 77 percent from 2003 to 2008, and each one involved at least one prescription drug. "Often the illegal prescription drug of choice is oxycodone, a very strong narcotic commonly prescribed to relieve moderate to severe pain," Kottkamp wrote. "Nearly all of the top 50 prescribers of oxycodone in the United States are located in Florida." Kottkamp's op-ed contains several interesting facts, but we're choosing to focus on perhaps the most startling number -- that "nearly all of the top 50 prescribers of oxycodone in the United States are located in Florida." Oxycodone is the active ingredient in OxyContin and other painkillers such as Percocet. Oxycodone abuses have been well documented, particularly the problems in Florida. From 2001 to 2008, more than 2,000 Floridians have died of overdoses of oxycodone, the St. Petersburg Times reported. The Miami Herald also wrote an in-depth examination of the problem last year. Kottkamp said the problem was more severe in Florida because the state had lax regulation, particularly in tracking clinics that prescribed a large amount of the drug. Abuse, in part, stems from "pill mills," which can be advertised as pain clinics, but can also be health care facilities that routinely conspire in prescribing and dispensing controlled substances, Kottkamp says. Are almost all of the top 50 prescribers of oxycodone -- the leading candidates to be pill mills -- in Florida? We started by asking the Governor's Office of Drug Control, a group Kottkamp leads, to see if the figure was accurate. Bruce Grant, the director of the drug control office, cited a report from the United Way of Broward County Commission on Substance Abuse. While the report focuses primarily on Broward County, it uses national figures from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to say that 49 of the 50 top prescribers are in Florida. And 25 of the top 50 prescribers are in Broward, according to the report, which relied on figures from Oct. 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009. "We're trying -- without saying the sky is falling -- to let people know this is a genuine crisis," said Grant. "This is bad." Grant said South Florida has become a popular marketplace for people from all over the country who want the painkiller. "If you go down there, when you see what's going on, it will blow your mind," Grant said. "The parking lots are literally filled with out of state plates. People from Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, they're hanging around. People are lined up outside the doors." DEA Special Agent David Melenkevitz, who is based in Miami, confirmed the accuracy of the Broward report. He said the numbers come from oxycodone distribution statistics, which the DEA tracks. A list of the specific pharmacies or clinics is not public record, Melenkevitz said. And what can be done to tame the problem? In an interview, Kottkamp said the Legislature took a good first step last year when it approved a bill that requires the state to track and monitor the distribution of certain prescription drugs. Kottkamp also supports measures that would regulate who can own a pain clinic, restrict the ability of clincis to be "cash only," and take away the ability to dispense medications on site. "We need to bring all of our resources to bear," Kottkamp said. "What we don't want to happen is that these clinics move out of South Florida and just move to some other part of the state. We want to drive them out of business all together." Back to Kottkamp's original statement. Trying to underscore the severity of the prescription drug problem in Florida, Kottkamp said that "nearly all of the top 50 prescribers" of the powerful pain killer oxycodone in the country are located in Florida. The DEA, using its most recent data, says that 49 out of 50 of the top oxycodone prescribers are located in Florida. We rate Kottkamp's statement True.

pomt-05071	By eliminating the public intervenor’s office, "I was the first one to fire Kathleen Falk."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/05/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-he-fired-kathleen-falk-elimina/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson made an extra effort to demonstrate his passion for property rights while addressing a tea party audience in Oconomowoc on June 4, 2012. He talked up life on his 700-acre farm. He said as governor he "took on the DNR" -- the Department of Natural Resources -- and also took control of appointing the agency’s leader. He blasted "Agenda 21," the United Nations environmental program. And, with a touch of glee in his voice, he recounted how as governor he got rid of Kathleen Falk as a public intervenor, a position in the state Attorney General’s office that served as a sort of watchdog in environmental disputes. Falk, a Democrat appointed to the position by Attorney General Bronson La Follette, later was elected four times as Dane County executive. She lost races for governor in 2002, attorney general in 2006 and governor again in the 2012 recall primary. "Who had the guts to take away the public intervenor in this state?" Thompson said at a meeting of the Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty. "I got rid of Kathleen Falk!" he added, to big laughs in the crowd. "I was the first one to fire Kathleen Falk!" Did then-Governor Thompson eliminate the public intervenor’s office, getting "rid" of Falk and becoming the "first to fire" her? Let’s roll back the clock. The issue arose in 1995, when Thompson -- then in his third term as governor -- sought to eliminate the public intervenor’s office in his two-year budget. "It’s a law office hired by the state to sue us," Thompson complained at the time. He considered the intervenors "state-financed lawyers for the environmental movement." Proponents said the office saved the state money by solving problems and heading off lawsuits by environmental groups. The office was created in 1969 by Gov. Warren Knowles, a Republican, as an independent mediator to represent the public's interest in court and state agency decisions. The intervenors were assistant attorneys who often sued other state agencies to register objections to plans for highway, dredging and mining projects. When Thompson made his move, two assistant attorneys general -- Falk and Thomas Dawson -- had full-time intervenor status. Both had served as intervenors under both Republican and Democratic attorneys general. In his budget bill, Thompson proposed doing away with the intervenor’s office by wiping out the attorney general’s authority to appoint intervenors. Although Republicans both chambers of the Legislature, the Senate passed a compromise abolishing one intervenor, and moving the other to the Thompson-controlled DNR with no power to sue. Two years later, the Legislature and Thompson eliminated the DNR position, with Democrats saying it had little authority. So Thompson can take credit for abolishing the office, which directly led to Falk losing the intervenor job. But does that mean Thompson fired her? Both Falk and Dawson stayed on as assistant attorneys general, just doing different assignments. Both positions were under the civil service system, so they could not lose their job by the stroke of Thompson’s pen. Falk stayed in the office for about two years until she left in 1997 to become Dane County executive. Dawson is a staff attorney in the office. Though Falk and others campaigned in subsequent years for restoring the intervenor’s office, it was never brought back. Thompson, of course, said he was the "first" to fire Falk. His campaign said he meant that statewide voters had later rejected her. That rings hollow because she never lost a campaign while holding an office. How can you be "fired" from a job you don’t have? Our rating Thompson said he was the "first to fire" Falk by eliminating the environmental watchdog known as the state public intervenor’s office. In making the remark, he did so in the context of abolishing the office, so he’s on target there. In a colloquial sense, "fired" may fit because Thompson knew Falk would no longer be intervenor due to his actions. But he went too far in leaving the impression Falk was out on the street. And Falk was never removed from any other job we know of, so Thompson misfired with "first to fire." We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-08058	"Over 80 percent of the people want the shot to vote" on whether to approve same-sex marriage, according to polls.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/26/vincent-buddy-cianci/cianci-says-polls-support-idea-more-80-percent-rho/	The question of whether same-sex marriage should be legal in Rhode Island could be answered in the coming year. There's growing support in the General Assembly to passing it and Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee has vowed to support it. One group opposed to gay marriage, the National Organization for Marriage -- Rhode Island (NOM-RI), however, has been advocating for a binding referendum on the matter instead of a legislative vote, arguing that polls prove the people want the right to make the decision. Talk-radio host and former Providence Mayor Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci repeatedly cited the 80-percent figure during the Dec. 12, 2010, "6 News On The Record" program on WLNE-TV. "One of the things I do know from seeing polls that I see every day is that over 80 percent of the people want the shot to vote for it," he said. "The polls that I've seen show that 80 percent of Rhode Islanders want the opportunity to vote," he said at another point in the program. "I'm not saying that they're against gay marriage or same-sex marriage, but they say they want the opportunity to vote on it." We were curious about whether public sentiment was that strong against having the legislature and the governor decide the question. It turns out that the polls in question were commissioned by NOM-RI, the group opposing same-sex marriage. Christopher C. Plante, the group's executive director, said there were three surveys done by Quest Research, which is based in Rhode Island. Here at PolitiFact, we know that opinion polls can be tricky things. The answers you get often depend on the precise wording of the question and, in some cases, the questions or comments leading up to the question. "When any interest group puts forward a poll, one has to be careful in judging the results because the question's wording may reflect the axe they want to grind," said John Geer, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University and author of "From Tea Leaves to Opinion Polls." So we wanted to see the full poll questions and responses. We found a report on a June 2009 poll on the NOM-RI website. Plante sent us the questions and answers from of the group's December 2009 survey. The group also did a poll in August 2010, but Plante declined to release those results. However, one question from that 2010 survey does appear on a NOM-RI web page. All three polls surveyed about 400 people and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percent. The question that directly addressed the issue was asked in both 2009 polls. It mentions that some people want to legalize gay marriage and asks whether this issue "should be decided by a vote of the Legislature or should it be decided by voters in a statewide election?" In June of that year, 74 percent said it should be the people. By December that percentage had jumped to 80. The rate of support was even higher -- 82 percent in June and 84 percent in December -- when the question was worded this way: "Voters in thirty states in America have had the opportunity to decide whether gay marriage would be legalized in their state. Do you think Rhode Island voters should also have an opportunity to vote on this issue?" The two independent polling experts we consulted said the reference to those 30 other states made this a loaded question because it encourages Rhode Islanders to follow the trend. "That's totally loading it. That's a classic example of generating a higher number," Geer said. The phrasing added 10 percentage points to the let-the-people-decide category when the question was asked in the June survey; 2 points in December. The only question released by NOM-RI in its August 2010 poll, which also shows strong support for letting the people decide, asked likely voters whether they agreed or disagreed with this statement: "The people of Rhode Island themselves should decide the question of marriage, not judges or backroom politicians." The reference to "backroom politicians" (as opposed to "frontroom politicians"?) "is clearly a negative cue in the question. That's clearly designed to elicit a particular response," said James Henson, co-director, University of Texas / Texas Tribune Poll. For that question, 77 percent "strongly" or "somewhat" agreed. "I suspect the 'backroom politician' phrase is getting the 'strongly agree' to go up quite substantially," said Geer. Although NOM-RI cites Quest as the polling organization, Victor Profughi of Quest said he did not design the questions in all the polls, particularly the survey that used the "backroom politicians" phrase. "The last questionnaire I didn't even see until we went into the field," he said. "My agreement with them was to draw the sample, make sure the survey itself was professionally undertaken and then I wrote a report based on the data, which I gave to them." Despite some biased questions, the two independent pollsters we consulted said the 80 percent figure is probably close to the truth, judging from the responses when the query was unbiased query. (We also asked Cianci to weigh in on this, but he didn't respond to our e-mail.) "The numbers are overwhelming that the public wants to make that choice," said Geer. "Questionable wording can bias a poll when people don't have a lot of information and don't have any strong set of prior opinions about a topic." Because a lot of people have a strong opinions on gay marriage, "you probably can't move the numbers very much," he said. But there's another phenomenon at work here, Geer and Henson said. When asked, voters ALWAYS want to be the ones to decide hot-button issues. "Of course they're going to say yes," said Geer. "If you ask parents whether they or teachers should make decisions about their child, of course everybody's going to say themselves. So the numbers [in the NOM-RI poll] are hardly surprising." What's more revealing is how voters answered some of the other questions in the two 2009 surveys that NOM-RI made available. From June to December, support for same-sex marriage seemed to rise significantly, going from 36 percent in June to 43 percent in December. That December, only 32 percent said they opposed gay marriage, yet 44 percent expressed support for an anti-gay marriage proposal declaring that "Only marriage between a man and a woman will be valid or recognized in Rhode Island." Again, it's all about how you word the question. "If you ask people across the country, 'Do you think marriage should be an institution between a man and a woman,' you'd probably get 75 percent of the people saying yes. But if you say, 'Should we deny gay couples the opportunities afforded other couples,' then all of a sudden there's a lot more support for gay rights," said Geer. In the end, none of the questions we saw directly ask Rhode Islanders whether they want the General Assembly to stay out of the same-sex marriage issue. But it appears that, when the question is posed in a neutral way, a hefty majority wants voters to determine the issue. Cianci didn't mention that support for a referendum on same-sex marriage fell below 80 percent in some polls. Nor did he mention that the polling was being done by a special interest group. And we believe the former mayor -- who eats, drinks and breathes politics, and currently serves as a political consultant for Channel 6 -- knows loaded questions when he sees them. Those are important elements for people to know. Yet Cianci simply kept repeating the 80 percent figure as it were a consistent, reliable number. Because of that omission, the Truth-O-Meter drops a notch and we'll rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Vincent "Buddy" Cianci	None	None	None	2010-12-26T00:01:00	2010-12-12	['None']
pomt-04726	"The majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/30/mitt-romney/romney-says-majority-americans-now-pessimistic-abo/	Mitt Romney made his case for the presidency by reminding his audience of the optimism they felt four years ago when Barack Obama was elected -- and the pessimism they feel now. "The majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future," Romney said Aug. 30 at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. We wondered if he was right about Americans’ gloomy outlook. A poll of 500 adults nationwide conducted in May for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal asked, "Do you feel confident or not confident that life for our children's generation will be better than it has been for us?" A majority -- 63 percent -- responded that they were "not confident" while 30 percent answered "confident." Seven percent were unsure. But this is not a new phenomenon, as he suggests. A majority has said that nearly every time the poll has been conducted -- 10 times since 1992. Only in December 2001 did more respondents (49 percent) say they were confident about their children’s future than were not confident (42 percent). A similar poll conducted for CBS News and the New York Times in April asked 957 adults, "Do you think the future of the next generation of Americans will be better, worse, or about the same as life today?" The "worse" answer had a plurality: 47 percent. Twenty-four percent answered "better" and 23 percent said "about the same." That poll, conducted six times since 2009, also reflected widespread pessimism, with "worse" being the most frequent answer every time. Finally, a USA Today/Gallup poll of 1,012 adults conducted in May surveyed whether Americans are satisfied with "the opportunity for the next generation of Americans to live better than their parents." Nearly six in 10 Americans -- 58 percent -- said they were dissatisfied, while 40 percent said they were satisfied. Our ruling Romney said that "the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future." We found three polls that support his claim. Americans are indeed pessimistic about their children’s prospects. But that’s nothing new, according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. For at least the last 20 years, Americans have expected that our kids would be worse off than we are. Romney cast this national outlook as specifically an Obama-era phenomenon.

pomt-04440	Says she’s never said "don’t build" Texas 45 Southwest.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/oct/12/karen-huber/karen-huber-says-shes-never-said-dont-build-texas-/	Residents along Brodie Lane in Southwest Travis County who want a highway to divert inbound commuters say Karen Huber is blocking the way. Former County Judge Bill Aleshire, who lives on Brodie, suggested we check this statement from Huber, a Democrat campaigning to keep her Precinct 3 seat on the Travis County Commissioners Court: "I've never said, ‘Don't build it.' I've said, ‘Prove the cost-benefit is there.' " That could prove of interest to Nov. 6 voters deciding between Huber and Republican opponent Gerald Daugherty, a staunch supporter of building Texas 45 Southwest — a 3.6-mile road that would connect FM 1626 and South MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1). Huber has taken action against the project both as a commissioner and as a member of the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization. But has she supported not building it? The comment Aleshire flagged came from a Sept. 17, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story, so we began by talking to the newspaper’s transportation reporter, Ben Wear, and asking Aleshire for evidence contradicting Huber. Wear and archived Statesman stories got us up to speed on the long-proposed project. Currently pitched as a four-lane tollway divided by a median, it’s been part of the CAMPO long-range transportation plan for years; the right-of-way for it was purchased in 1997. Every five years, CAMPO’s board approves a rewrite of the 25-year plan, which looks at everything from roads, trains, planes, public transit and freight to bikes and feet in Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties. "Any road or transit project that uses federal money, as most of them do, must be in the plan to qualify for that money," said a May 24, 2010, Statesman news story. This stretch of Texas 45 Southwest was proposed in the mid-1980s as part of a Texas 45 that encircled the entire metropolitan area and was to be dubbed the Austin Outer Parkway. Some segments were later built, others abandoned. Wear described the road’s potential impact today — or rather, sometime after 2020 to 2025, when construction might start under CAMPO’s plan — in his Feb. 5, 2012, column: A horde of exurbanites from places such as Kyle and Buda comes up FM 1626 each weekday morning to go to work in Austin. Right now, those people have to then take crowded Brodie Lane (and then Slaughter Lane or William Cannon Drive) to get to MoPac. Texas 45 Southwest would allow those commuters a more or less straight shot to MoPac. Critics of Texas 45 Southwest, including Huber, say there’s not enough evidence that the highway would ease Brodie traffic. They also cite environmental concerns, because the road would cross the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone. In a June 11, 2010, opinion piece in the Statesman, Huber wrote: Because of constraints on transportation funding, Texas 45 SW is now proposed as a toll road. No study yet demonstrates that commuters would pay the tolls and avoid Brodie. ... It is irresponsible to spend an estimated $100 million on Texas 45 SW without effectively justifying it. Meanwhile, there are other projects of much more demonstrated need and much higher priority that must be built first, like increasing vehicle capacity on South MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) and improvements to the Y at Oak Hill. According to Statesman news stories, Huber introduced a resolution in May 2010 asking her Commissioners Court colleagues to support culling 45 from the CAMPO plan. It passed 3-1, effectively ending county backing for the road. Huber is also a member of the CAMPO board, which consists mainly of local elected officials. In that capacity, she made an unsuccessful motion later in May 2010 to drop 45 from the plan. The board approved the plan with two votes against (one being Huber’s) and 17 votes in favor. The May 24, 2010, Statesman story quotes Huber: "We've got real priority problems in this plan. I cannot support this plan, because I cannot support business as usual." The story said, "However, she did successfully knock down an eleventh-hour recommendation from TxDOT that construction on Texas 45 Southwest begin in 2015 rather than 2020." Aleshire, whom we interviewed by phone and email, sent us news articles and documents describing Huber’s opposition to the road. None quoted Huber saying she wanted to stop the road outright, though they included instances of Huber offering reasons not to proceed immediately. We asked editors at two local newspapers covering the Texas 45 issue whether they recalled or had reported Huber saying "Don’t build it" or something similarly unequivocal. Editor Will Atkins of the Oak Hill Gazette and managing editor Veronica Gordon of the Hays Free Press each told us by phone they did not recall such a statement. Atkins searched his paper’s archives, also finding no such statement. While Aleshire acknowledged he didn’t have direct evidence, he told us that the "proof is her motion at Commissioners Court to remove it from the county plans and her motion at CAMPO to delete it from the Metropolitan Transportation Plan entirely, making the project ineligible for state or federal funding." Were Huber’s actions to pull 45 out of the plan equivalent to saying "Don’t build it"? In a phone interview, CAMPO director Maureen McCoy told us she didn’t think removing 45 from the plan would keep it from being built because it could later be restored to the plan by an amendment. It’s "not atypical" for a road to be added to the plan that way, she said. If the road weren’t in the plan, it wouldn’t be eligible for federal funding. We asked TxDOT Austin spokesman Chris Bishop how likely it was that the state could build such a road. "We have done roads without it," he said. "Matter of fact, at one point I remember this was proposed as being done with state funds." He recalled two nearby examples of roads built with state funding, albeit two decades ago: Texas 45 Southwest between FM 1826 and MoPac and the stretch of South MoPac to Texas 71/Ben White Boulevard. Whether the puzzle pieces of state funding, local funding, potential toll revenues, etc., would come together for this road is a variable, he and McCoy said, as is the project’s eventual cost. McCoy pointed out that the study now being conducted on the road’s environmental impact could indicate, for example, that the road should have two lanes instead of four. By telephone, Huber told us she’s been consistent in her position: "I’m saying, on that road, that I do not believe we should move forward with it till we conclude that it is going to do what they say it is going to do" (in easing Brodie traffic). Now, in fact, Huber said she doesn’t mind keeping 45 in the CAMPO plan, because that allows the environmental study to continue. "I just don’t believe we should go to construction until we have answers." Our ruling Huber claimed that she’s never said "don’t build" Texas 45 Southwest. As far as we can tell, there’s no instance of Huber being so blunt. But her efforts to get the road pulled from the CAMPO plan and her stated desire not to proceed to construction without more information are evidence she doesn’t want the project built yet. These important details are not reflected in her statement, which we rate Half True.	None	Karen Huber	None	None	None	2012-10-12T14:52:12	2012-09-17	['None']
pomt-02868	"Onion Creek’s highest flow rate" on a recent night of flooding "was 120,000 cubic feet per second, which is nearly double the average flow rate of Niagara Falls."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/nov/14/city-austin/during-flood-austins-onion-creek-flowed-34-percent/	On a recent day of fatal flash floods, a Southeast Austin creek ran so quickly, it outpaced Niagara Falls in a way, the City of Austin said. A Nov. 6, 2013, city press release said that according to the U.S. Geological Survey, water "levels at Onion Creek at U.S. 183 reached its record height of 41 feet during the Oct. 31," 2013 "storm, when the U.S. 183 water gauge rose 11 feet in 15 minutes between 6:15 a.m. and 6:30 a.m." Also, the release said, available "records show that water levels never before exceeded 40 feet at this location and only exceeded 35 feet during three other years: 2001, 1921 and 1869." Flooding in Southeast Austin damaged or destroyed about 660 structures and at least five lives were lost, three of them in the Onion Creek area, the Austin American-Statesman later reported. The city’s press release continued: "The Onion Creek’s highest flow rate during Oct. 31 was 120,000 cubic feet per second, which is nearly double the average flow rate of Niagara Falls." Flow rate is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit of time, the release said. Do both ends of this flow-rate claim hold water? By telephone and email, officials later told us they based the reference to the Onion Creek flow rate on USGS information on the creek’s flow at U.S. 183 on Austin’s southeastern edge. They said the cited average flow rate of Niagara Falls, the international tourist site in New York state and Canada, came from Wikipedia, the collaboratively edited, multilingual free Internet encyclopedia. By email, city spokeswoman Wendy Morgan sent what she described as a Nov. 4, 2013, printout of the service’s Onion Creek flow measurements showing even higher flow rates. The USGS figures indicate that the creek’s Oct. 31 flow rate was 126,000 cubic feet per second at 8:43 a.m and 134,000 cubic feet per second at 9:45 a.m. The printout shows no flow readings at 10 a.m. and 10:07 a.m. with the flow rate being 130,000 cubic feet per second at 10:20 a.m. and decreasing, mostly, over the next 80 minutes. Morgan said the press release relied on older "provisional" USGS flow-rate figures. And what of Niagara Falls? Paul Yura, a National Weather Service meteorologist based in New Braunfels, noted by phone that the Wikipedia entry for Niagara Falls includes a statistical box (absent a listed source) stating Niagara Falls has an average flow rate of 64,750 cubic feet per second. Yura said he and other officials responding to the situation and trying to convey the significance of the creek’s rise "were trying to find some quick numbers" to show the flow’s surge. Morgan said separately: "We were trying to find an analogy that conveyed the force of the water flow." Toward lining up an authoritative indication of the average flow of Niagara Falls, we reached an Albany-based USGS hydrologist, Gary Firda, who pointed out by phone that the falls are on the Niagara River, which connects Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. According to a Sept. 21, 2012, USGS report, the river’s average 2011 flow rate at the head of the river at Buffalo, about 17 miles above the falls, was 201,400 cubic feet per second while the average flow rate from 1926 through 2011 was 204,400 cubic feet per second. And has the average flow of the falls themselves been considerably less? Firda said he didn’t know, suggesting that we reach out to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal body with some jurisdiction over the river on the border with Canada. A Corps web page states that the flow of the 36-mile-long Niagara River changes based on factors including narrowing and widening along the way, diversions into channels and canals and islands in its path. Significantly too, the U.S. and Canada divert water for power generation. "The first production of electrical power dates from 1877. Since then, there has been a continuous growth, which is now limited only by the control imposed by the Niagara Treaty of 1950," the web page says. "This treaty, between the governments of Canada and the United States, requires a minimum flow over the falls of 100,000 (cubic feet per second)" from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. April through mid-September every year and from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. from mid-September through October each year. "A minimum flow of 50,000 cfs is required at all other times (non-tourist hours)," the district says. Mandated minimum flows aren’t the same as an average flow, we heard from Corps officials including George Cotroneo, who heads the Lower Great Lakes Hydraulics and Hydrology Branch in the agency’s Buffalo district. By phone, Cotroneo said the government doesn’t track the average flow rate over the falls. But generally, he said, that rate varies based on the time of day and year and factors including how much water is diverted upstream to generate electricity. All that aside, Cotroneo said he estimates the average flow rate over the falls at 100,000 cubic feet per second, or about half the average flow of the river upstream at Buffalo. "It’s not necessarily 100,000 cubic feet per second going over the falls during tourist season," Cotroneo said, though he said he considers that the average because it’s the minimum flow rate when tourists make their visits. "It could be more, depending on diversions to" power plants. He said, too, that heavy winds can cause the falls to plunge even faster. We asked Cotroneo if he was familiar with the average flow-rate figure posted on the Wikipedia page. He said he wasn’t before speculating that the figure was calculated based on the time periods and minimum flow rates stipulated by the 1950 treaty. "I wouldn’t do that," he said. We later reached a Chicago-based official with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, John W. Kangas, who doubles as U.S. secretary for the International Niagara Committee, a body created under the 1950 treaty to determine the amount of water available for the falls and power generation. Kangas said by email that he devised an equation based on the flow requirements in the treaty that supports an average minimum flow rate at the falls of 66,600 cubic feet per second. Kangas agreed that the flow rate is 100,000 cubic feet per second when summer tourists flock there. Our ruling The city said Onion Creek’s highest flow rate of 120,000 cubic feet per second during a recent flood nearly doubled the average flow of Niagara Falls. We didn’t find a time-stamped, ribbon-wrapped figure for the average flow rate of Niagara Falls. But the city’s declared "highest" flow rate of the creek was 20 percent greater--not nearly double--the average flow rate of the falls as estimated by a federal expert who based his assessment on the flow rate in tourist season. The creek’s actual highest flow rate that day, of 134,000 cubic feet per second, was 34 percent greater. This claim has an element of truth; the creek briefly ran faster than Niagara Falls on average. But the press release understated the creek’s highest flow and also gave an unsourced figure for the average flow of the falls. We rate the statement as Mostly False. CLARIFICATION, 1:30 p.m., Nov. 18, 2013: We amended this article to clarify that an official's estimate of the flow rate of Niagara Falls was based on the flow when tourists are typically there. We also added information collected after we published this article indicating that there is an equation supporting the idea that the falls' minimum average flow rate is about 66,000 cubic feet per second. Our rating did not change. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-03693	Says Abraham Lincoln supported an agreement that allowed slavery in New Mexico "and a law to return runaway slaves to their owners."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/21/paul-ryan/lincoln-backed-slavery-measures-us-rep-paul-ryan-s/	Over the years, PolitiFact has verified some interesting trivia about Abraham Lincoln. A claim that wrestling was one of Lincoln’s favorite sports he’s in the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, it turns out) was rated True. So was a claim that Lincoln once slipped out a window in an attempt to prevent vote in the Illinois Legislature. Now comes a more serious claim -- that the Great Emancipator once supported slavery measures. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., made the statement in a speech April 11, 2013 to the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that seeks to elect pro-life women to Congress. The potential 2016 presidential candidate invoked Lincoln in arguing that abortion opponents should try to appeal to "the broadest audience" by working, when possible, with abortion rights supporters. "Our forebears knew to strive for perfection, not to expect it -- because mankind is flawed. Progress takes time. It takes work. And it takes common sense," Ryan said midway through his speech, entitled "Building a Coalition for Life." "Take Lincoln. He hated slavery as much as anyone. But he defended a law that preserved it. He supported the Compromise of 1850, which prohibited slavery in California but allowed it in New Mexico. He even backed a law to return runaway slaves to their owners." Lincoln agreed to compromises, Ryan asserted, "if they brought him closer to his goal -- even in just a small way. We all know what happened. After years of turmoil, he helped pass the Thirteenth Amendment, which ended slavery for good." We’ll check the two specific parts of Ryan’s claim -- that Lincoln supported an agreement that allowed slavery in New Mexico "and a law to return runaway slaves to their owners." Ryan’s position Asked to back Ryan’s statement, his press secretary, Kevin Seifert, cited this passage from Lincoln, a biography by historian David Herbert Donald: Lincoln "did not call for the elimination of slavery in all national territories; he stood pledged to the Compromise of 1850, which allowed New Mexico and Utah to tolerate or to forbid slavery. He accepted the Fugitive Slave Act, though he suggested it should be modified so that it would ‘not in its stringency, be more likely to carry a free man into slavery, than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one.’" Seifert also cited a document that notes that the Compromise in 1850, which admitted California into the Union as a free state and allowed New Mexico, then a territory, to decide whether to allow slavery. To dig further, we consulted eight Lincoln experts. They generally agreed Ryan’s statement is partially accurate, but lacks key details. New Mexico and slavery While Ryan said Lincoln "supported" the Compromise in 1850, Lincoln was actually semi-retired from politics at the time, having left Congress a year earlier (he wasn’t elected president until 1860). At the time of the compromise Lincoln did not express support for it, according to several experts, including Lincoln biographer Ronald C. White Jr.; Michael Burlingame, a Lincoln scholar at the University of Illinois-Springfield; and Columbia University historian Eric Foner. As president, Lincoln did agree to a proposal that would have admitted New Mexico as a state, said Lincoln biographer James McPherson. So in that sense, he could be said to have supported the Compromise of 1850, in that New Mexico had opted to approve a slave code. On the other hand, McPherson said, no slaves were counted in New Mexico in the 1860 census, which indicates slavery had not taken hold there. Fugitive Slave Act Similarly, Lincoln as president held that the federal government needed to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act, mandating for the return of runaway slaves, given that it was the law of the land. But, McPherson noted, Lincoln wanted legislation to give alleged fugitive slaves a trial before they could be returned. "He did feel there was no choice but to defend the legality of the Fugitive Slave Act once it became law, and even said so in his first inaugural address -- but here some context is needed, too," said Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer. "He refused to oppose so-called ‘personal liberty laws’ that were passed by northern states to justify disobedience to the Fugitive Slave Act. "So, in sum, Lincoln always opposed slavery," said James Cornelius, curator at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library & Museum. "But he also held, privately and out loud, that federal law must be obeyed." Our rating Ryan said Abraham Lincoln supported an agreement that allowed slavery in New Mexico "and a law to return runaway slaves to their owners." He goes too far. Lincoln backed an agreement that allowed New Mexico to decide whether it would allow slavery. And Lincoln held that the federal government needed to abide the return of runaway slaves, given that was the law of the land, but he didn’t support it. Ryan’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. That fits our definition for Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2013-04-21T09:00:00	2013-04-11	['New_Mexico']
pomt-02609	Marijuana today is "genetically modified," with THC levels that "far surpass the marijuana" of the 1970s.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/24/patrick-kennedy/has-potency-pot-changed-president-obama-was-high-s/	Apparently, back when President Barack Obama would get high with the Choom Gang, he was tokin’ on some weak product by today’s standards. At least, that’s what one former congressman says. After Obama told The New Yorker that marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol — which opened the door to a broader conversation about legalizing or decriminalizing a drug that’s on the federal government’s most restrictive list, Schedule I — former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., said the president needs to brush up on his pot knowledge. "I think the president needs to speak to his (National Institute of Health) director in charge of drug abuse," said Kennedy, who chairs Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. The NIH director "would tell the president that, in fact, today’s modern, genetically modified marijuana (has) much higher THC levels, far surpass(ing) the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person." Obama’s exploits as a pot-smoking adolescent are well documented in his own memoir, Dreams from My Father. More recently, in journalist David Maraniss’ biography Barack Obama: The Story, readers learned that Obama as a high schooler in the late 1970s rolled with a group called the Choom Gang — friends from Hawaii who frequently got high. But has marijuana changed that much? We decided to investigate. What is THC? Cannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant. The level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC. THC levels also differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years. But what about marijuana itself? Has weed as we once knew it become more potent? The answer is: yes. THC levels are on the rise, and they have been for quite some time. The University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972. The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period. Back in the late 1970s when Obama was in high school (he graduated in 1979), the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, said Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research at Ole Miss. Further, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007. But while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isn’t likely to increase, ElSohly said. How did it get so strong? The former congressman said the reason for the increasing levels of THC is genetic modification. That’s not quite right. Genetic modification or genetic engineering involves altering a substance’s DNA at the molecular level. Producers of marijuana on the illicit market don’t have the ability to pull off those kinds of lab-based modifications. However, genetic selection involves breeding marijuana plants with the highest concentration of THC. Genetic selection, unlike genetic modification, has been practiced for centuries. Think about how we got different breeds of dogs or varieties of tomatoes. Genetic selection is quite prevalent in marijuana, ElSohly said. Drug dealers have steered toward these methods in hopes of creating a product that enables them to sell smaller volume at a higher cost. Cultivation methods that allow growers to control climate, water and soil levels have dramatically improved production as well, he said, and they have a better idea what parts of the plant produce the highest concentration of THC. There is some genetic engineering of marijuana in labs, but it’s not widespread yet and it’s not the cause for the increase, ElSohly said. What does it mean? What does this rise in potency mean in a practical sense? Let’s start with what the National Institutes of Health says, since Kennedy singled out the government agency. Noting that the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana has increased in recent decades, the NIH warns that "daily use can have stronger effects on a developing teen brain than it did 10 or 20 years ago." Researchers have warned against marijuana use by teens and even young adults, noting that developing brains have an increased risk of dependency. That was an issue even before potency factored in, though the growing strength of the drug does have health officials more concerned. Those concerns are also directed at populations who had already been advised against smoking marijuana when THC levels were lower, such as individuals with cardiovascular diseases or those with certain mental illness, such as schizophrenia. But for the average adult recreational or habitual user, there’s a lot less certainty about what rising THC levels mean. Only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level. In that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs. Roger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we don’t know everything about its potential impact. Beyond dependency, health officials also warn that smoking marijuana can cause paranoia and in some cases anxiety attacks. Hospital visits caused by marijuana are on the rise over the last decade, from 359,795 in 2004 to 540,340 in 2011. However, it is unclear if that is caused by higher potency levels, greater usage of marijuana or other factors. This is all important food for thought, because the debate is ongoing and more research is needed. However, this didn't affect our ruling. Our ruling Kennedy said that marijuana today is "genetically modified," with THC levels that "far surpass the marijuana" of the 1970s. Generally speaking, the potency of marijuana has been on the rise since Obama’s youth, though experts disagree about what impact that rise could have on marijuana’s negative health effects, in part because the research so far has been incomplete. The most off-base part of Kennedy’s claim is that the rise in THC levels comes from "genetic modification." It’s actually from genetic selection, a very old process of producing desired traits from crops. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-09244	Says Gov. Rick Perry failed "to involve border sheriffs in developing plans to prevent violence in their communities."	false	/texas/statements/2010/may/10/boyd-richie/sheriffs-say-perry-included-them-developing-spillo/	Gov. Rick Perry has expressed reservations about Arizona's hard-line immigration law which requires legal immigrants to carry documents identifying their legal status and which critics say encourages unconstitutional racial profiling. Boyd Richie, chair of the Texas Democratic Party, also disagrees with the Arizona law, though Richie doesn't think much of Perry. "For 10 years as governor, Rick Perry has played politics when leadership was needed on border and immigration issues," Richie said in a press release issued April 30, "from wasteful border cameras that cost $153,800 per arrest to his failure to involve border sheriffs in developing plans to prevent violence in their communities." We're not gauging if the video cameras lining the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border are wasteful; that's an opinion. Besides, toss in 24 additional reported arrests attributed in some way to the cameras since The Texas Tribune developed the per-arrest estimate and the so-called cost per arrest becomes $80,000 — an average that stands to decrease as arrests mount. We're focusing on whether Perry has failed to involve sheriffs in border security plans — especially the "spillover violence contingency plan" developed last year. Perry's office earlier spearheaded two other law enforcement initatives on the border, Operation Linebacker in 2006 and Operation Border Star in 2007. On behalf of Richie's claim, Democratic spokeswoman Daniela Santoni sent us a March 17 letter to Perry from Elfrain Valdez, mayor of Del Rio and chairman of the Texas Border Coalition, which advocates for security on the Texas-Mexico border. Valdez airs frustration that Perry hadn't consulted coalition members before activating the first phase of the state's spillover violence plan March 16. That move upped law enforcement, sent two helicopters to the border and put Ranger Reconnaissance and SWAT teams on standby. The day before, gunmen had killed two Americans in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, across the border from El Paso. Valdez writes: "Along with my elected colleagues on the border, I have watched with interest the announcement that you are activating the first phase of your Spillover Violence Contingency Plan. We live on the border and have responsibility for our communities and our citizens. However, at this point we are learning about your plans along with everyone else." Santoni also forwarded several news stories, two covering the coalition's discontent and echoing border leaders' concerns that violence hasn't spilled from Mexico into Texas. The third, a March 22 article in The Tribune, says Perry didn't alert Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino and others before activating the spillover violence plan — with El Paso being the only city alerted before the activation. Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger disputed the report, telling us the spillover violence plan "was developed in early 2009 with input from our local and federal law enforcement partners to prepare for the possibility of violence spilling over into the United States." Separately, Don Reay, executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, said Perry may have "failed to include the mayors, but he certainly didn't fail to include law enforcement agencies." Sheriffs of the 18 border counties formed the group in 2005 to lobby for funding for border security. We didn't attempt to reach every border sheriff, but law officers in Hudspeth County, east of El Paso, Terrell County, adjacent to Big Bend National Park, and Hidalgo County, more toward the east end of the border, said the governor's office has kept them well informed, partly through e-mails sent from their respective Joint Operational and Intelligence Centers — there are five, in El Paso, Laredo, Del Rio, Victoria and Rio Grande Valley. Hidalgo County Sheriff Trevino, whose community is adjacent to frequent gun battles in Reynosa, Mexico, said information flow from Perry's office could have been better when the spillover plan was implemented in March, but generally communication "between the state and the local and the federal agencies, at least in my area, is excellent. We receive daily briefings, we are on top of everything, we have great coordination, we have very frequent meetings where we discuss trends." When we told Richie's camp that at least some sheriffs disagree with Richie's statement, Santoni stood by the party's original cache of news articles. She added: "We consider the activation of a plan a central component of the development of a plan." All told, where does that leave Richie's statement that Perry failed to involve border sheriffs in developing plans to prevent violence in their communities? Lacking, only partly because most of Richie's evidence stems from border mayors who said Perry didn't notify them before activating the state's spillover security plan. Besides, Richie was absolute in his wording, suggesting that Perry didn't involve border sheriffs at all. Not so, we're persuaded. According to what we heard, the governor has worked with border sheriffs on security plans. We rate Richie's statement as False.

pomt-05967	"The median income in this country has declined 10 percent in the last four years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-median-income-has-declined-10-/	During the Jan. 23, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Mitt Romney offered an ominous statistic about how family finances have declined since the start of the last recession. He made the assertion when moderator Brian Williams of NBC News asked him, "Gov. Romney, you talk about restoring America's greatness. Given that, in your view when was America last great?" Romney responded, "America still is great, but we have a lot of people suffering. We have people that are underemployed that shouldn't be, unemployed that shouldn't be. Home values continue to go down. We have the median income in this country has declined 10 percent in the last four years. We're still a great nation, but a great nation doesn't have so many people suffering." We wondered whether he was correct that "the median income in this country has declined 10 percent in the last four years." As we awaited a response from the Romney camp, we looked at the official government statistics, which come from a data set of the U.S. Census Bureau called the Current Population Survey -- Annual Social and Economic Supplements. We looked at the trend for inflation-adjusted median incomes for households between 2007 and 2010, and between 2006 and 2010, both of which could be considered as the "last four years." The figures are produced annually and are not yet available for 2011 -- a key point we’ll return to in a moment. Between 2007 and 2010, the median declined by 6.3 percent, while between 2006 and 2010, the median declined by 5.1 percent. Both figures amount to considerably less than the 10 percent decline Romney specified. What gives? The Romney camp explained that they had taken the statistic from a report published by a private agency, Sentier Research, based on other Census Bureau data. Last year, Sentier initiated a new statistic -- a "household income index" that tracks upticks and downticks in median income on a monthly basis, rather than annually. The Census Bureau "will not issue an official estimate for 2011 until this coming September," said Gordon Green, one of the firm’s principals and a co-author of the report Romney referenced. But with the economy struggling and a presidential election looming, he said, "people want to know." The index allows economists to pinpoint income studies more narrowly than they can with annual figures, since the beginnings and ends of recessions do not typically track the calendar year. To create the index, Green and his colleague John Coder took data from the Census Bureau’s monthly household survey -- the one that’s used to determine the national unemployment rate. This sample reaches approximately 50,000 households and 130,000 household members each month, asking a variety of questions, including the sum of income earned by household members during previous 12 months. When Green and Coder released their October report, the finding was striking enough to be written about prominently in the New York Times. Between December 2007 -- the official beginning of the last recession -- and June 2011, "real median annual household income has declined by 9.8 percent," the authors wrote. "A decline of this magnitude represents a significant reduction in the American standard of living." This finding -- a nearly 10 percent decline -- was what Romney was referring to in the debate, his campaign confirmed to PolitiFact. But that isn’t the end of the story. Green told us that the 9.8 percent figure is now outdated. In July, the index fell again, but in August 2011 it began ticking up and has continued increasing through November 2011. The new decline is 8.2 percent, rather than 9.8. The new figures for December are due out within days, Green said. So by not referring to the most recent report, Romney overstates the scale of the decline. There are two other issues we think are worth mentioning. First, both the Sentier data and the annual median income data from the Census Bureau that we cited earlier refer to pre-tax income and exclude "near-cash" benefits such as food stamps and housing assistance. However, several economists told PolitiFact that using post-tax income and including food stamps and housing assistance in the calculation (data that is generally hard to come by) would likely show smaller declines than the ones recorded by either the Sentier or official Census Bureau data, and would offer a more useful picture of what was actually happening economically on the household level. The difference would stem in part from payroll tax cuts and tax credits signed by President Barack Obama, as well as growing numbers of Americans receiving food stamps in recent years -- neither of which are reflected in the figures Romney cited. Second, the Sentier data set is new, and lacks the outside scrutiny that comes with a years-long track record. On the plus side, Green and Coder came to Sentier after long careers at the Census Bureau -- Green as chief of the governments division and Coder as chief of the income statistics branch -- and their firm’s client list, according to its website, includes such prominent institutions as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Social Security Administration, the Urban Institute, the Brookings Institution, the American Enterprise Institute, several universities and the Census Bureau itself. Still, outside economists said the new index is going to have to prove its accuracy over the long term. Due to the limitations in the available census data, Sentier’s methodology includes a series of complicated adjustments, and it uses a four-month "moving" average for its data, in which one-quarter of the data every month is new, with the oldest one-fourth of the data jettisoned. The co-authors wrote that they did this because "estimates based solely on the 25-percent sample entering in a single month exhibit an unacceptable level of sampling variability." "Assuming it’s been matched against previous, authoritative measures of median income based on detailed questionnaires or income tax data," the new household income index "may provide a useful, up-to-date indicator of current money income trends," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "All I know for sure is that the Green-Coder estimate is not yet considered authoritative by any income expert that I know." Our ruling In the debate, Romney used a relatively new measurement to make his point -- one that shows higher declines in income than the standard statistics do. The statistics Romney used were created by two veteran Census Bureau number crunchers, and experts say that their approach includes both advantages (notably, timeliness) and disadvantages (most importantly, a short track record). More important for our analysis, though, is also the numbers Romney used are outdated. Over the most recent four months, the statistics show median income rebounding, making the decline since the start of the last recession smaller than Romney said it was. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-24T16:35:19	2012-01-23	['None']
pomt-04145	"Connecticut has the fifth toughest gun control laws in the country, including an assault weapons ban that bans 35 different weapons."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/02/jack-kingston/kingston-makes-issue-connecticuts-gun-control-laws/	Even ardent gun rights supporters are willing to talk gun control in the wake of the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn. During a Dec. 18 grilling by MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston said gun control should be "up for discussion" alongside violent video games and mental health. The Savannah Republican was endorsed by the National Rifle Association in 2012 and received an A+ grade from the group. Changing gun laws may not be the answer, though. "Connecticut has the fifth toughest gun control laws in the country, including an assault weapons ban that bans 35 different weapons," Kingston said. A Kingston spokesman did not reply to our request for more information, so we searched for state-by-state comparisons of gun control laws and reviewed Connecticut’s assault weapons statute. The term "assault weapon" is controversial. Various state laws use the phrase, although the National Rifle Association argues that gun control advocates created it to "trick the public into believing that ‘assault weapons’ were fully-automatic machine guns used by the military," its website says. There’s no formal definition for what counts as an assault weapon. Laws describing them vary. In general, the term refers to a semi-automatic firearm that resembles a fully automatic one or those used by militaries. Connecticut law generally bans the sale, transfer or possession of assault weapons. State statute defines them in two ways: Through a list of 37 gun models. By describing features that, when combined, constitute an assault weapon. For instance, a semi-automatic rifle with a detachable magazine, a folding or telescoping stock and a grenade launcher would be banned under Connecticut’s law. Connecticut’s law lists 37 guns, not 35, so Kingston’s not far from the mark. Technically speaking, the statute is written so that firearms outside the list can be prohibited, but this is a minor problem. What about Connecticut’s ranking? The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence uses a point system to rank states based on whether their statutes met the group’s standards on curbing firearm trafficking; background checks; child safety requirements and other factors. Connecticut’s laws were ranked the fifth strongest in the nation in 2011, the group’s most recent list. It was bested by California, New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York. Georgia tied for 22nd. The nutmeg state scored well consistently. We checked the rankings back to 2007 and found it made the top five each time. Still, Connecticut’s 58 points lagged well behind first place California, which earned 81 points. The state’s assault weapons ban was one reason why. It earned only three out of a possible 10 points because magazines that carry more than 10 rounds remain legal there. Also, the Brady Campaign prefers a different definition for an assault weapon. "While it’s the state with the fifth strongest gun laws, obviously, at 58 points out of 100, there’s a lot more the state can do," said Brian Malte, a spokesman for the group. We found that groups that push for tougher gun laws consistently give Connecticut high marks. For instance, the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ranked Connecticut fourth in its 2012 report, and fifth in 2010. It assigns points to each state based on 29 aspects of gun law, including the sale and transfer of firearms, owner responsibilities, and rules on their handling in public places. The center Georgia ranked 24th in 2012. And Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which boasts membership of more than 700 mayors, including Atlanta’s Kasim Reed, issued a 2010 report that compared states based on whether they enacted 10 key types of gun laws. Connecticut had put nine of the 10 types in place. Only New York and New Jersey received a 10 out of 10. Georgia had enacted two. Our conclusion: Kingston is right on this one. Connecticut consistently ranks high in lists of states with stringent gun laws, and literally ranked fifth in recent rankings by the Brady Campaign and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Furthermore, he’s pretty close on the number of assault weapons banned in Connecticut law. Kingston earns a True.	None	Jack Kingston	None	None	None	2013-01-02T06:00:00	2012-12-18	['None']
pomt-00822	Florida is "one of the few states that has actually had a narrowing of the achievement gap based on income, or based on race or ethnicity."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/27/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-praises-florida-closing-achievement-gap/	In his first foray into New Hampshire as a potential Republican presidential contender, former Gov. Jeb Bush talked up Florida’s record on education during his tenure. Bush, who was governor between 1999 and 2007, talked about how the state stopped automatically moving up third-graders to fourth grade if they weren’t deemed ready. (The old approach has sometimes been called "social promotion.") And he also touted that during his tenure Florida started the state’s voluntary prekindergarten program. Such policies paid off, Bush said. "We had significant gains, particularly with kids in poverty," Bush said at a business roundtable in Hudson, N.H., March 13. "Florida continues to be one of the states that does the best with low-income kids, and we are one of the few states that has actually had a narrowing of the achievement gap based on income, or based on race or ethnicity." Is Bush correct that Florida is one of the few states that narrowed the achievement gap for minorities and the poor? We took a closer look. The achievement gap for Hispanics and blacks When we asked Matt Gorman, a spokesman for Bush’s Right to Rise PAC, for evidence supporting Bush’s claim, he sent us some data from the National Center for Education Statistics, an office of the U.S. Education Department, originating with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP. This test, which measures a sample of fourth- and eighth-graders nationwide on math and reading, is dubbed "the nation’s report card" because the data can be used to draw comparisons between states and among racial, ethnic and income groups. "Achievement gaps" occur when one group of students outperforms another group in average scores, as long as the difference is statistically significant. The size of such gaps, and how they compare to past gaps, can vary widely, depending upon the years and subgroups chosen. Not surprisingly, Bush zeroed in on some of the statistics that put Florida in the most favorable light. Gorman pointed to test results comparing 2003 with 2013 that showed that Florida had narrowed the achievement gap between white and black students in fourth and eighth grade, on both the math and reading tests. That claim checks out -- an Education Department spokesman confirmed that Florida was the only state to narrow that gap for both grade levels and for subject matters for that specific time span. However, by changing the date range, we found different results. For example, Florida didn’t narrow the white-black gap if we compared certain other years between 2000 and 2013. (A caveat: 2003 was the first year that all the states had to participate in NAEP. In previous years, some didn’t.) Meanwhile, the data for ethnicity and income -- also cited by Bush -- are more problematic for Bush’s claim. Florida failed to narrow the gap by much between whites and Hispanics between 2003 and 2013 for fourth-grade math, eighth-grade math or eighth-grade reading. The one gap that did narrow was fourth-grade reading. (We’ll note that sometimes the gap narrowed, but if it was only slightly NAEP does not consider the state to be among the ones that narrowed the gap.) As for income, NAEP looks at students who are eligible for free and reduced lunches and compares them to those who are not. For this comparison, Gorman pointed to a different set of years -- 2003 and 2009. That time span was mentioned in a report by the Education Trust; it stated that Florida significantly narrowed the gap between low-income and higher-income students in fourth-grade reading. The gap for fourth-grade reading narrowed by 8 percentage points in Florida (and three other states), compared to a narrowing of 2 points nationally. Overall, then, Bush has a point about Florida narrowing the white-black gap, but the support for Florida having narrowed the white-Hispanic gap is weak. On income, Bush has a point that Florida narrowed the gap, at least for particular years. It’s worth noting that in some cases Florida’s gap was already smaller than the nation as a whole, making it difficult for Bush to have overseen further narrowing of the gap. For example in 2013, the NAEP showed that Florida’s Hispanic fourth-graders ranked the first state in the nation for highest average reading score. And we’ve heard before from experts who say we can’t simply compare Florida’s Hispanics to Hispanics in other states when income and other factors play a role, too. Also, it’s hard to say how much Bush’s policy changes contributed to the improvements in achievement, since other demographic or economic factors outside the governor’s influence could have played a role. University of Iowa education professor David Bills said that before he could conclude that Florida "did" anything to narrow the Hispanic-white gap, he would have to know about changes in the state’s Hispanic population -- for example, if their income had gone up or down. Our ruling Bush said Florida is "one of the few states that has actually had a narrowing of the achievement gap based on income, or based on race or ethnicity." Changes in the achievement gap can vary widely depending on the years studied, the tests chosen and the student groups measured, but Bush can point to fairly strong evidence on the black-white gap narrowing, fairly weak evidence of improvements in the white-Hispanic gap, and modest evidence backing up gains among poorer students. As for how unique Florida is, Bush has a point that it was the only state to consistently narrow the gap between black and white students, at least on math and reading tests between 2003 and 2013. The state wasn’t a national leader in closing the achievement gap between whites and Hispanics, though Florida’s Hispanic students are a leader on fourth-grade reading scores. On balance, then, Bush is more correct than not, so we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-03-27T11:05:15	2015-03-13	['None']
pomt-09460	"Debt has almost doubled in Austin under Gov. Perry."	true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/04/bill-white/white-says-texas-debt-has-doubled-under-perry/	Race for governor, Round 2. Gov. Rick Perry bested U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and underdog Debra Medina in the Republican primary while former Houston Mayor Bill White walloped businessman Farouk Shami for the Democratic nomination. Celebrating separately Tuesday night, both candidates rallied their respective supporters. For Perry, that meant warning Washington to "stop messing with Texas," a tenet of his primary campaign. White, meanwhile, started to niggle his new opponent — suggesting Perry and his consultants point to national debt to distract voters from Texas' record. "Debt has almost doubled in Austin under Gov. Perry," White said. "They think you will not notice this!" Game on. Is White right? We checked with the Texas Bond Review Board, which oversees the state's issuance of most bonds used to fund numerous activities, from helping local governments with economic development to building prisons to making housing loans to veterans. According to the board's annual reports, Texas had $34.08 billion in outstanding bonds and notes as of Aug. 31 — the end of the 2009 fiscal year. Perry took office Dec. 21, 2000 — nearly five months into fiscal year 2001. At the end of that year, Texas had $13.7 billion in outstanding bonds and notes. Adjusting for inflation, that would have equaled $16.6 billion in 2009. But there's a subset of state debt that hasn't surged, Perry's campaign pointed out — currently $3.07 billion to support parks and for construction of state facilities, among other activities. That debt has decreased by about 6 percent since 2001. Then there's debt to be repaid with program revenue. For example, interest on student loans is used to repay the bond that funded it without the state having to commit general revenue. That "self-supporting" debt has increased by 173 percent since 2001. Regardless, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, noted that lots of things have probably doubled since Perry became governor. After all, he's held the office for nearly a decade. Eva DeLuna Castro, a senior budget analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, also said it'd be a stretch to say Perry was solely responsible for all those debt decisions. "Voters do that, and the Legislature," she said. "So we're all responsible." Perry is one of four members on the Bond Review Board, which ultimately approves most state debt transactions. And over the years, we found, he was a leading advocate for expanding state debts to pay for transportation projects and to combat cancer. It turns out that transportation is responsible for most of the added debt load under Perry, increasing from basically nothing in 2000 to $11.8 billion outstanding as of Aug. 31 2009. That's because before 2001, the Texas Department of Transportation lacked the authority to borrow money to pay for road projects. Voters gave it that power in 2001 when they approved a constitutional amendment that Perry supported. Addressing transportation in his 2001 state of the state speech, Perry said, "I would like for both chambers to pass a bonding program to jump-start construction across our state." In 2007, voters also passed a constitutional amendment to create and fund the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas with $3 billion in bonds over 10 years, starting in January 2010. Perry had championed the cause with cyclist and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong and others. Where does that leave us? It's clear the amount of state debt has more than doubled since Perry became governor. We rate White's statement as True.

pomt-14061	"Let me say that I don't think (Bernie Sanders has) had a single negative ad ever run against him."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrong-negative-ads-bernie-sanders/	Hillary Clinton, who said this week she "will be the party’s nominee," emphasized on Meet the Press that she’s already won more votes than rival Bernie Sanders and she’ll also be the better prepared candidate for the fall. When Chuck Todd pointed out that Sanders fares better than Clinton in head-to-head matchups against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, Clinton suggested Sanders hasn’t been vetted as thoroughly as she’s been. "Let me say that I don't think he's had a single negative ad ever run against him. And that's fine. But we know what we're going into, and we understand what it's going to take to win in the fall," she said. "And finally, I would say that, you know, polls this far out mean nothing." Clinton has a point that compared with her, Sanders hasn’t really felt the burn of negative ad blitzes from Republican groups. But her claim that he hasn’t had "a single ad ever run against him" is an exaggeration. Dem-on-Dem negative campaigning Many of the attacks we found on Sanders in the Political TV Ad Archive actually come from other Democrats, including by Clinton supporters. Generation Forward, a pro-Martin O’Malley super PAC, went after Sanders while O’Malley was still in the race. In an attack ad, the group highlighted Sanders’ and Clinton’s Saturday Night Live portrayals and less-than-serious moments on the campaign trail (i.e. dancing). It ended with O’Malley saying a presidency shouldn’t be about entertainment. Another ad attacked Sanders for his record on guns: "Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill — background checks and waiting periods. ... Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns." (We rated the claim about background checks Mostly True.) The Sanders campaign referred us to web videos by Correct the Record, a super PAC hybrid known as a Carey committee that supports Clinton. The group’s YouTube channel includes at least 13 negative videos about Sanders. (Correct the Record said that its videos are not ads as it does not "do any paid public communications.") One focuses on Sanders’ controversial interview with the New York Daily News and is entitled "Bernie Sanders’ Sandy Hook Shame." Another asks, "Will Bernie Sanders explain why he’s sided with the gun lobby time and time again?" (This charge is largely inaccurate.) Others focus on Sanders’ "going negative" against Clinton and his record with fact-checkers. The Clinton campaign itself sent a President's Day-themed attack ad against Sanders through text messages, BuzzFeed reported. After audio of Sanders saying it would be a good idea if President Barack Obama "faced primary opposition" in 2012, the text reads, "Hillary is the only one in this race who’ll fight for the progress we’ve made under Pres. Obama." Largely, but not totally spared by Republicans Clinton, who has been a national figure and subject of GOP criticism for decades, is right that she’s faced far more negative campaigning than Sanders has. The Political TV Ad Archive includes some 120 ads either attacking Clinton directly or drawing unfavorable parallels between her and Republican candidates. Besides virtually all of the 2016 contenders on the GOP side, Clinton’s been consistently hit by conservative super PACs, the Republican National Committee and even some down-ballot GOP candidates. Sanders, on the other hand, has been largely spared by the Republican attack machine this cycle, and Clinton’s campaign sent us several articles to that point. Given that the ads would write themselves ("And everyone knows what that pummeling would focus on: He's a self-proclaimed socialist," writes Mother Jones’ David Corn), why are Republicans leaving Sanders alone? The answer seems to be that they don’t really see him as a threat. "Sanders has an important message that is resonating with many. But that is not enough to win the nomination. Why spend money that will have little return on the investment?" said John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote In Defense of Negativity: Attack Advertising in Presidential Campaign and spoke with us in April. In one case, a "faux attack" from a conservative super PAC appears to actually bolster Sanders, illustrating another line of argument: Republicans may prefer to run against the more radical Sanders in a general election. Though Sanders hasn’t been hit nearly as hard as Clinton, he has been attacked by the right a few times. Future 45, a conservative Super PAC funded by backers of Marco Rubio, ran a 30-second spot sounding the alarms on higher taxes to come under Sanders. Sanders is also featured in Republican-on-Republican attack ads as an unfavorable comparison. For example, the anti-Trump Club for Growth has highlighted similarities between Trump’s positions and Sanders’ (as well as Clinton’s and Obama’s). Similarly, American Future Fund, a conservative 501(c)(4) or "dark money" group, ran an attack ad against Ted Cruz by lumping him in with Sanders and other Democrats on national security issues. Mike Huckabee’s campaign, meanwhile, warned voters about "a crazy old man named Bernie" in a rhyming Christmas-themed ad and crooned "Hello from the caucus night. If Bernie wins, I’m going to die" in an Adele-inspired attack. We should also note 2016 is not the 74-year-old’s first time around the block. He has, after all, competed in political races since the 1970s. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs pointed to "blistering negative ads in his first Senate campaign." In 2006, Sanders’ Republican opponent Richard Tarrant spent millions on ads accusing Sanders of wanting to protect child molesters and voting against single-working mothers. They didn’t end up doing much for Tarrant, who lost to Sanders by 33 percentage points. Our ruling Clinton said, "Let me say that I don't think (Sanders has) had a single negative ad ever run against him." The number of attack ads against Sanders pales in comparison to the number against Clinton, but she’s wrong that he’s been completely spared. Democratic groups, including one supporting Clinton, and Republican outfits alike have gone after Sanders. We rate her claim False. Update, May 23, 2016: This report has been updated to include a response we received from Correct the Record after initial publication. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d7df3b83-bd90-4892-b050-86ae781485af	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-05-22T16:07:11	2016-05-22	['Bernie_Sanders']
pomt-08660	Clayton County has employed 1,300 people over the past seven months through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/14/mickie-williams/clayton-officials-say-housing-program-has-employed/	Clayton County got a boost from the federal government in April 2009 in its effort to combat the ongoing crisis of mortgage foreclosures. The south metro Atlanta county received a $9.7 million grant through the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program to buy foreclosed homes, fix them up and resell them to new buyers. County officials say they've noticed another benefit of the federal program -- the effort is keeping people employed and helping others get hired. Clayton's NSP manager, Mickie Williams, told county commissioners at a Sept. 7 meeting that about 1,300 people have been employed through the program over the past seven months. That sounds like good news when you consider that the most recent unemployment rate is 10.2 percent in Clayton and the nine other counties that are part of the Atlanta Regional Commission. Williams repeated the claim she made to commissioners in a telephone interview with AJC PolitiFact Georgia. She said she may be underestimating the total. "We're keeping the doors open on some of the small businesses," Williams said. So how did Clayton County come to this conclusion? Williams said the county had 114 homes under contract in the past seven months. She said the county hires at least 12 people to work on the purchase, renovation and selling of each home. That adds up to 1,368. The workers include contractors, loan officers, appraisers, inspectors, real estate agents, asset management, construction workers and the cleaning crew. John Adams, a longtime real estate investor who writes a weekly column for the AJC's Homefinder section, called Clayton County's methodology to come up with the number of people employed through the program "loose." Adams wondered how long was each person employed and about the significance of the work they performed. "I don't doubt the number, but I question its meaning," he said. Adams directed us to a 2008 study by the National Association of Home Builders. The study found 1.1 construction jobs are created when you spend $100,000 to remodel a home. Three construction jobs are created when you build a new home. We found a 2009 report on that organization's website that estimated 78 jobs were supported by each $10 million spent on remodeling homes in a typical metro area. NAHB used federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data to come up with its findings. Paul Emrath, a co-author of the report, said the 78 job estimate is full-time positions that someone worked during an entire 12-month period. There's little research on the impact of the NSP on job creation and retention. Its focus is on getting people into homes. Clayton officials estimate there are about 900 foreclosures per month. The state of Georgia received $77 million during the first round of grants. Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties were awarded NSP grants, as well as the city of Atlanta. Clayton started spending its NSP funds in January, Williams said. The NSP program, which was passed in 2008, is administered under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Joseph Phillips, a regional spokesman for HUD, said the federal agency does not keep track of how many people are employed through each grant recipient. The city of Atlanta has a list of 185 vendors who have done work for its NSP efforts, but they do not keep a breakdown of how many people are employed in each project. AJC PolitiFact Georgia interviewed several people who buy, renovate and resell foreclosed homes. Each one said they worked with a dozen or more people during the process. Bryan Eastman, who builds homes in several southeast Atlanta neighborhoods, rattled off the names of 25 different types of people he works with. Jeff Baillis, who fixes up homes in southwest Atlanta, said he typically works with about a dozen people. The work usually takes more than a month. "You can keep going and going and going," said Philippe Pellerin of Real Estate Alliance Partners, an Atlanta NSP partner who buys and resells homes in Atlanta neighborhoods like Peoplestown and Summerhill. We went back to a key question Adams asked: How long do these architects, drywall contractors and closing attorneys work on these projects? Williams said that is difficult to estimate because each project is different. The drywall repair work on one house may take more time than another, she said. Greg Shealey, a leader of one of the four asset management teams Clayton County used to handle the construction work on its NSP efforts, said one house may take two weeks to fix while another could take about two months. He estimated the crews spend about 60 hours a week on each house. Emrath and others noted, job creation and retention was not the main purpose of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. No one interviewed doubted 1,300 people have been hired to do work by Clayton County. But, as Emrath and others said, it would be easier to examine the numbers if Clayton had a breakdown of how much work each person hired performed for the county. People who work independently to buy, fix up and resell homes offer similar estimates to Clayton concerning the number of people they've hired to do such work. Clayton County's initial statement appears accurate. But it's based on estimates that can't be confirmed, and for that reason, we believe it needs more context. We rate the NSP estimate as Half True.

pomt-05257	"When it comes to what little bit of job creation was happening in Massachusetts (when Mitt Romney was governor), it was happening in the public sector at six times the rate that it was happening in the private sector."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/31/martin-omalley/omalley-criticizes-massachusetts-job-growth-under-/	With the presidential campaign focusing on the economy, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley is making the case that President Barack Obama is a better job creator than Republican Mitt Romney. In an appearance on Meet the Press on May 27, 2012, O’Malley, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, squared off with former presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, who defended Romney. Gingrich called Obama’s effect on employment "disastrous" and said voters will question whether they can afford another four years with him in the White House. O’Malley then brought up Romney’s record while governor of Massachusetts. "When it comes to what little bit of job creation was happening in Massachusetts, it was happening in the public sector at six times the rate that it was happening in the private sector," O’Malley, a Democrat, said. We decided to look into that job creation statistic. Massachusetts job numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show private-sector employment grew by 0.79 percent during Romney’s term. O'Malley said "public sector" in his claim, but that would also include local government jobs. That rate of increase is 1.57 percent -- about double the private-sector rate, which is significantly lower than O'Malley's six-times claim. O'Malley may have been referring to the state payroll, which saw a growth rate of 4.73 percent -- just about six times the rate of private-sector growth. If he had specified state jobs, the area Romney presumably had the most control over, O'Malley would have been accurate. Still, even that description is misleading because of the disparity in raw numbers between government and private-sector jobs. By using rate rather than the actual numbers, he gives the impression of a larger increase in public-sector jobs. In raw numbers, though, private-sector jobs increased by 22,400, while state jobs grew by 5,300. "The private sector accounted for a bigger share of all payroll employment gains in Massachusetts during Gov. Romney’s term," said Gary Burtless, a labor market expert with the centrist Brookings Institution. (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of John McCain, and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) He added: "The more legitimate criticism of Gov. Romney’s job creation record is that total payroll employment growth lagged far behind the experience of the rest of the country." For 2002 to 2006, the national growth rate was 5.2 percent, while Massachusetts’ rate was just .7 percent. Our ruling O’Malley said that Massachusetts’ public sector payroll grew at six times the rate of the private sector during Romney’s term as governor. That statistic is true only when counting state employees. But he said "public sector," which would include local government workers such as teachers and cops. What’s more, as Burtless pointed out, even though the growth rate was greater in government jobs, private-sector jobs still accounted for more of the state’s increase. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. That meets our definition of Half True.

pomt-11017	"ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/06/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-misrepresents-ices-detent/	Before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez upset top-ranking Democrat Joe Crowley in a New York congressional primary election in June, she laid out her stance on Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in an interview with The Intercept. "The fact that they operate without the accountability of the Department of Justice is extremely concerning to us all," said the Democratic candidate for Congress in New York’s 14th Congressional District, who has recently become well-known for leading calls to "abolish ICE". Ocasio-Cortez went on to say the fact that ICE operates under the Department of Homeland Security, rather than the Department of Justice, is problematic. "As a matter of fact, ICE is the only criminal investigative agency, the only enforcement agency in the United States that has a bed quota. So ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009," Ocasio-Cortez stated. Ocasio-Cortez’s claim had us wondering: Is ICE required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every night? Although the experts we spoke to told us ICE faces pressure from a variety of places to detain a large number of people, we found the legislation Ocasio-Cortez was referring to doesn’t require ICE to detain 34,000 people a day. Rather, it requires ICE to maintain 34,000 available beds a day. ‘Beds, not people’ Ocasio-Cortez was referring to a clause in the DHS Appropriations Act of 2016, which states that with the funds it receives from Congress through the act, ICE "shall maintain a level of not less than 34,000 detention beds through September 30, 2016." According to Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, the mandate exists because Congress wants to "make sure that ICE does not use the detention bed money for something less effective." The mandate first appeared in the DHS Appropriations Act of 2010. So while Congress requires ICE to make 34,000 beds available each day, it doesn’t require those beds to be filled. This isn't the first time this figure has come up. During a congressional hearing in 2014, U.S. Rep. Raúl Labrador, R-Idaho, asked then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson for clarification on the detention bed quota, as it is known. "There is nothing in the law that is mandating you to put 34,000 people on these beds. Is that correct?" Labrador asked. To which Johnson responded: "I don’t read the law that way. It doesn’t read that way … It says beds, not people." Peter Margulies, a professor of law at Roger Williams University, told us, "unfortunately, this became a little bit of an urban legend, in a way, about what the appropriations statute required." An ICE official also confirmed to PolitiFact that the language in the appropriations bills require ICE to maintain at least 34,000 beds each day, but don’t require ICE to fill those beds. However, according to a DHS report, in order to track compliance with the congressional mandate, ICE measures its "average daily population." So while the letter of the law may not require ICE to detain 34,000 people each day, it may have been in ICE’s best interest to act like it did. Unwritten rules Under DHS Secretary Johnson, ICE’s position was clear: 34,000 beds needed to be available, but not necessarily filled. But DHS secretaries have interpreted the appropriations legislation differently. In a 2013 congressional hearing, then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano hinted that the detention bed quota was tying ICE’s hands, saying that "we ought to be managing the actual detention population to risk, not to an arbitrary number." Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, told us that bureaucracy is a driving force behind the increased detention. "A plain reading of the statute would be that they (ICE) just need to have the beds available but not fill them. I think in practice, they have felt that they needed to fill them (because) they are being funded for those beds and they don't want to lose that funding." Has the number always been increasing? Ocasio-Cortez also stated that that number "has only been increasing since 2009." Though we’ve already established that no such numerical detainee requirement exists in the law for ICE, we decided to see if this part of Ocasio-Cortez’s claim was correct by looking at how the language in the appropriations bills changed from year to year. We found that her claim was not accurate. The DHS appropriations bills from 2010 to 2016 all included similar bed quotas. But the most recent 2017 and 2018 appropriations bills contained no such language. Experts confirmed with us that the detention bed quota language had been eliminated in 2017, and did not reappear in the current bill. While ICE’s average daily population has overall been on the rise since 2009, to say that the number tied to the detention bed quota has risen, as Ocasio-Cortez did, is inaccurate. Our ruling Ocasio-Cortez claimed that "ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009." The language in the congressional appropriations bills from 2009 through 2016 only mandates that ICE keep at least 33,400 (later 34,000) beds available. The bills don’t state that those beds need to be filled. Under different DHS secretaries, the government’s interpretation of the law has varied as to whether the beds need to be filled or not. In addition, the last time the language requiring ICE to maintain a certain number of beds appeared in an appropriations bill was 2016. So, Ocasio-Cortez’s claim that the "number (of detainees ICE is required to detain) has only been increasing since 2009" is inaccurate. We rate Ocasio-Cortez’s claim False. ​ See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez	None	None	None	2018-07-06T09:30:00	2018-06-27	['None']
pomt-13917	My administration is "well represented both racially, ethnically and gender-wise."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jun/24/jim-kenney/kenney-administration-and-thorny-problem-diversity/	Mayor Jim Kenney boasted of his administration’s diversity numbers at the Better Bike Share Conference in Philadelphia Thursday. Clarena Tolson, deputy managing director of the Office of Transportation and Infrastructure (oTIS) had just given well received remarks to introduce the mayor. When addressing the crowd, seemingly in reference to Tolson, he said, "I have some advice for anyone who wants to be successful in their career: Hire and promote smart women. Because they’ll get it done. "We went about doing that in the beginning of the administration through [the] transition. We are well represented both racially, ethnically and gender-wise." Kenney has received both good and bad attention for his hiring. A month into his administration, Philadelphia Magazine noted that 55 percent of his appointees were women. The magazine also reported that 34 percent his appointees were people of color. Does that mean it’s diverse? There are multiple ways we could measure diversity in the Kenney administration. Using this organizational chart as a basis, PolitiFact PA estimates at least 60 percent of the administration’s top brass is white, while some 50 percent are women. Exempt employees making more than $90,000, according to the city, are 61 percent white. Reacting to demographics for certain city departments, Council President Darrell Clarke called racial representation across execs "clearly problematic" during a budget hearing. City employees overall are 57 percent of color. (Philadelphia demographically is 44 percent black, 14 percent Hispanic, seven percent Asian, one percent Native American or Pacific Islander, and 34 percent white.) The disparity between the racial makeup between high-level employees versus the overall workforce predates Kenney’s term. Philly.com analysis found that in 2015, 64 percent of Nutter adminstration staffers making more than $85,000 were white, comparable to the current admistration’s numbers. This issue is by no means unique to Philadelphia. Kenney is among a recent wave of American mayors tackling this City Hall hiring gap with new tactics, perhaps following the lead of Boston’s Marty Walsh, Pittsburgh’s Bill Peduto, and former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels. Kenney appointed the city’s first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, Nolan Atkinson, whom he named before taking office. Many observers might say that the disparity needs closer examination. (Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said as much before the mayor’s swearing-in, in an email to Billy Penn last November.) Advocates and politicians have pointed to hiring practices and a less-than-ideal pipeline that’s not tracking candidates of color for the top jobs. Also of interest: according to Philadelphia Magazine, 57 percent of Kenney’s appointees, "at least," had worked in the previous administration. "[T]he City has some complicated, underlying barriers to racial and gender diversity, which the Mayor has acknowledged on multiple occasions," Mike Dunn, another city spokesperson, said in an email. "It’s why he created the position of the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, so that is one office’s full time responsibility to address these barriers in a systemic, focused way." Dunn mentioned that Pew is currently studying their workforce diversity, looking into policy fixes and best practices. "The outcome of the study will likely lead to changes made by the City to make city employment more representative of the population," Dunn wrote. Our ruling Kenney said his administration was "well-represented both racially, ethnically and gender-wise." Philadelphia is the only major city where women constitute the majority of workers. It’s a slight majority, and that’s close to what Kenney’s administration looks like. This is something for which Kenney has been celebrated. The other categories in his comment are another story, though. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto gets praise— his administration has been called Pittsburgh’s most diverse ever— for appointing a comparable percentage of blacks. But Pittsburgh is about two thirds white. Philadelphia is roughly two thirds of color. The Kenney administration’s numbers racially aren’t representative of Philadelphia. Sixty-one percent of the city’s top earners are white. While African-Americans are underrepresented, Asians and Latinos are even more so: Four percent of employees paid more than $90,000 are Hispanic; another four percent are Asian. In the city’s population as a whole, those two groups represent more than 2.5 times that. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Jim Kenney	None	None	None	2016-06-24T10:15:00	2016-06-23	['None']
pomt-06108	"The Social Security trust fund … is already facing imminent bankruptcy."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/03/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-social-security-trust-fund-faces/	As 2011 wound down and Congress dickered over extension of a temporary payroll tax cut for 160 million Americans, concerns about the extension cross party lines. A significant number of Democrats and Republicans argued that cutting that tax,which finances Social Security, will undermine the program. During the negotiations, House Speaker John Boehner told reporters that the payroll tax cut was an issue on which House Republicans were ready to work with President Obama to find common ground. "The key question is, how do we pay for it?" the Ohio Republican said. "It's important that the payroll tax cut be paid for because that money is used to fund the Social Security trust fund, which is already facing imminent bankruptcy." That drew the notice of PolitiFact Ohio. "Imminent bankruptcy" describes a dire situation requiring immediate attention. We asked Boehner's office for evidence. They referred us to the summary of the annual reports of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds that was issued last spring, and one passage in particular: "Social Security expenditures exceeded the program's non-interest income in 2010 for the first time since 1983. The $49 billion deficit last year (excluding interest income) and $46 billion projected deficit in 2011 are in large part due to the weakened economy and to downward income adjustments that correct for excess payroll tax revenue credited to the trust funds in earlier years." The status report goes on, however: "Through 2022," it says, "the annual cash deficits will be made up by redeeming trust fund assets from the General Fund of the Treasury. Because these redemptions will be less than interest earnings, trust fund balances will continue to grow. After 2022, trust fund assets will be redeemed in amounts that exceed interest earnings until trust fund reserves are exhausted in 2036, one year earlier than was projected last year. Thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2085." PolitiFact has been over this ground before. In recent history, the revenue raised in payroll taxes was more than enough to cover the benefits that Social Security needed to pay out. The excess went into a trust fund, which has now accumulated roughly $2.5 trillion. That money is not cash sitting in a vault somewhere. The federal government has loaned the money to itself, using the cash to pay for other expenses. The loan is in the form of special-issue Treasury bonds that earned $117.5 billion in interest in 2010, according to the latest trust fund report. Largely because of the recession, Social Security paid out more in benefits in the last two years than it raised from the payroll tax. To pay benefits in 2010 and 2011, Social Security supplemented money from the payroll tax with interest from the bonds, according to the Social Security Administration. According to the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund Reports, interest from the Treasury bonds -- plus revenue from the payroll tax -- will be insufficient to cover the cost of retiree checks in 2022. Fourteen years later, in 2036, the trust fund itself will be depleted, according to the report. If nothing is done, the only money flowing into Social Security will be the amount raised year-to-year in taxes. That will only cover about 75 percent of benefits through 2085. How does that add up for Boehner's statement about "imminent bankruptcy"? "Imminent" is defined by the dictionary as "about to happen." "Bankrupt" is a distinct legal term that means a person, company or government is unable to pay its debts. There is an element of truth here. Social Security is facing long-term fiscal challenges. But the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. The program is not out of money or unable to pay benefits. At the current pace, according to federal projections, scheduled benefits should continue to be paid in full for about 25 years. The sky may be darkening, but it is not falling. On the Truth-O-Meter, Boehner's statement is Mostly False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2012-01-03T06:00:00	2011-12-01	['None']
pomt-11859	Says special counsel Robert Mueller "has brought in Democrat campaign donors at a very high level" on his team of lawyers.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/03/sean-duffy/how-many-democrat-campaign-donors-special-counsel-/	U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, a northern Wisconsin Republican who has consistently backed Donald Trump, is making Democrat-bias allegations about a man who may pose a threat to Trump’s presidency: special counsel Robert Mueller. On Oct. 30, 2017, Mueller’s investigation produced its first criminal charges, its first guilty plea and the first public confirmation that an aide to Trump’s campaign sought an allegiance with Russians to gather "dirt" on Hillary Clinton. Duffy made his claim about Mueller the same day on CNN’s "New Day" show. He referred to Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2016 election, and the Democratic National Committee, saying: First of all, I support the investigation; I’m not asking for it to end. But I do have concerns that Mueller’s bringing in Democrat campaign donors at a very high level …. And I think that’s a mistake on his part. Let’s bring in non-partisan folks that -- or at least don’t have a partisan record because I think you open yourself up to criticism in making it partisan. So, how many of Mueller’s lawyers have made campaign contributions to Democrats, and how much? And is there evidence of a partisan bias on Mueller’s team? The charges and plea Duffy’s interview was prompted by the most significant developments for the special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, were indicted on a dozen felony counts, including money laundering. And George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the campaign, pleaded guilty to misleading the FBI about outreach efforts to Russian government officials. Papadopoulos is accused of falsely telling the FBI he was not part of the Trump campaign when a person described as an "overseas professor" told him that Russians possessed "dirt" on Clinton, in the form of "thousands of emails." As for Mueller, the special counsel’s office told us that it confirmed that Mueller is a longtime and current Republican. He is a former federal prosecutor who served as the FBI director under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, from 2001 to 2013. He was a partner at the WilmerHale law firm when he was chosen as the special counsel by the U.S. Justice Department in May 2017. Previous claim about the team A month after Mueller’s selection, Trump implied the investigation was politically motivated, making a claim more extreme than Duffy’s in saying: "I can say that the people that have been hired (for the independent Russia investigation) are all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton." PolitiFact National rated Trump’s statement Mostly False. At that point, the names of eight lawyers on Mueller’s team had been made public. Three had made campaign contributions to Clinton, but none had worked for her. One had defended the Clinton Foundation in court for WilmerHale. And another represented a Clinton aide, also for WilmerHale. The Justice Department looked into the contributions and employment histories of all of Mueller’s hires and determined them consistent with the rules of professional responsibility. Duffy's claim is a little more broad. Mueller’s team and their contributions Duffy’s office referred us to news reports on campaign contributions made by Mueller team members. The special counsel’s office told us that Mueller has 16 lawyers on his team, but that one of them has not been named publicly. That office provided us figures on how much the lawyers have given in total to Democrats and Republicans in federal campaigns. We also checked Federal Election Commission filings. Here’s what we found: Six of the 15 lawyers have not made campaign contributions to any political campaigns at the federal level. Among the lawyers who did make contributions, a total of $62,043 went to Democrats and $2,750 to Republicans, according to the special counsel’s office. In terms of Clinton specifically, election filings indicate that three lawyers gave her 2016 presidential campaign a total of $700; and three gave a total of $18,100 to either her 2016 campaign or her 2008 run for the presidential nomination. As for the implication of Duffy’s claim, here are points worth noting: One of the lawyers was a member of the team that won the 2015 conviction on federal corruption charges of Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who had been the longtime speaker of the New York State Assembly. The special counsel’s office pointed out to us that the legal standards for Justice Department hiring "prohibit the use of political or ideological affiliations to assess applicants." On that point, the Washington Post Fact Checker reported, in a June 2017 fact check on this issue: Federal regulations prohibit the Justice Department from considering the political affiliation or political contributions of career appointees, including those appointed to the Special Counsel’s Office. So the implication that Mueller is making politically motivated hires is quite a stretch, as he is legally prohibited from considering their political affiliations. Our rating Duffy says Mueller "has brought in Democrat campaign donors at a very high level" on his team of lawyers. Six of the 15 lawyers who have been publicly identified have not made campaign contributions to any political campaigns at the federal level. But among the lawyers who did make contributions, a total of $62,043 went to Democrats and $2,750 to Republicans, according to the special counsel’s office. As for a Democratic bias in the investigation, Duffy doesn’t specifically make that charge. But Mueller himself is a longtime Republican. And he is prohibited from choosing lawyers based on political affiliations. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2017-11-03T12:37:21	2017-11-30	['Robert_Mueller', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-14004	Because George Holding doesn’t live in the congressional district he’s running for, he "doesn’t experience the same things that we are all experiencing."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jun/03/renee-ellmers/north-carolinas-2nd-district-fight-over-residency-/	Rep. Renee Ellmers is attacking the authenticity of her main challenger for re-election in North Carolina’s 2nd District – a fellow member of the U.S. House of Representatives. "You know, the congressman doesn’t live in District 2," Ellmers said of her rival in the Republican primary, Rep. George Holding, in a recent debate. "I don’t want my family and friends to be represented by someone that doesn’t experience the same things that we are all experiencing. He can’t even vote for himself." In a recent redrawing of district lines, Holding’s 13th District was moved halfway across the state. It now runs between Mooresville and Greensboro. Holding’s home was placed in the 4th District, a solidly Democratic district represented by longtime Rep. David Price. But a quirk of U.S. election law is that you don’t have to live in a congressional district to represent it. So Holding chose to run for neither his current district nor the one he will be living in, but for the 2nd District represented by Ellmers, who has been the target of attacks from some conservative groups for not always voting the party line. Ellmers is right that Holding doesn’t live in the district he wants to represent. But does that mean he "doesn’t experience the same things that we are all experiencing"? The line implies he’s not familiar with the people who would be his constituents. And Ellmers doubled down, creating a website devoted entirely to the fact that Holding doesn’t live in the 2nd District. "Do you think someone who does not live in the 2nd district, and does not understand the needs of the 2nd district should be representing it?" the website asks, alongside a picture of Holding sleeping in Congress, from 2013. But Holding says he does understand the district, and we’re inclined to agree. In fact, the new 2nd District will contain far more people and places that Holding currently represents than Ellmers currently represents. "You know, I’m born and raised in Wake County," Holding responded to Ellmers during the recent debate. "Five generations of my family are from Wake County and Johnston County. When they redrew the district, they drew my neighborhood six miles out of the boundary. Hard for you to say I’m not part of this community." Six miles is a relatively short distance for a district that stretches for about a two-hour drive from its southwest end in Johnsonville to its northeast extremes in Whitakers. We looked up Holding’s house in the Wake County property records and found that’s true – his swanky cul-du-sac near Raleigh’s Five Points neighborhood is less than six miles from the closest 2nd District homes in north Raleigh and seven miles from the boundary in south Raleigh. The current lines The 2nd district that Ellmers currently represents includes all of Moore County as well as parts of Alamance, Chatham, Cumberland, Harnett, Hoke, Lee, Randolph and Wake counties. She won both the 2012 and 2014 elections with those boundaries. But seven of those nine counties will not be in the new 2nd District. Harnett County and parts of Wake County will. On the other hand, Holding’s current district, the 13th, was largely the basis for the new 2nd. In addition to Harnett County and the Wake County suburbs, it will also include parts of Franklin, Johnston, Nash and Wilson counties. Holding currently represents many of the same parts of Franklin, Nash and Wilson counties. But his constituency also includes parts of Edgecombe, Granville, Vance and Wayne counties, which won’t be part of the new 2nd. Comparing old, new boundaries In terms of both population and geography, Holding currently represents a much larger proportion of what will be the new district. Yet for whomever is elected (unless Brannon pulls an upset), the challenges of this new district won’t be much different from the district he or she currently represents – trying to balance the needs of wealthier suburban constituents with more impoverished rural areas, where unemployment remains higher. The largest concentration of people in the new district will be the Wake County suburbs, which both incumbents currently represent parts of, although Holding has the lion's share. Areas of the other five counties – Harnett, Franklinm Johnston, Nash and Wilson – have some suburban growth as well but tend to be more rural and less wealthy as they get further away from the Triangle. The 2010 lines Even though Holding currently represents most of what will be the 2nd District, Ellmers is also familiar with the territory. Many of the areas that are now in the 13th and after November will be in the 2nd were also part of a previous version of the 2nd. Some of the voters who live in those areas elevated Ellmers to power in the first place in 2010, when she unseated incumbent Democrat Bob Etheridge. "Many of the areas in the current ‘new map’ are areas that Congresswoman Ellmers was initially elected in during the 2010 election and areas that she served during her first term (2011-2013)," wrote her chief of staff, Al Lytton, in an email. "This included all of Franklin County, 2/3 of Nash County, all of Johnston County, all of Harnett County and portions of southern Wake County." Three boundary changes in six years, with populations shifting back and forth and back again into different districts? Maybe there’s a reason so many people don’t know who represents them in Washington. Our ruling Ellmers said Holding doesn’t live in the 2nd District and thus doesn’t understand the experiences of its constituents. While he doesn’t live in the district, Holding does represent most of the people who will be in the new 2nd District. Some of the areas will be new to him, and he will lose some of his current constituents. But on the whole, if Holding wins the election, this district’s challenges and needs will be largely the same as his current district’s. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05719	"Rhode Island is the only state where officers at state-supported [colleges] carry out their duties unarmed."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/07/glenford-shibley/state-sen-glenford-shibley-says-rhode-island-only-/	Rhode Island has long struggled with whether to arm its police on public college campuses. In January, state Sen. Glenford J. Shibley introduced legislation that would allow officers who patrol the campuses of the state’s three public institutions -- the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island -- to carry guns as long as they go through the requisite training. "Rhode Island is the only state where officers at state-supported institutions carry out their duties unarmed," said a General Assembly news release issued on the Coventry Republican’s behalf, announcing the introduction of his bill on Dec. 9. At a hearing Feb. 28 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Shibley repeated that statement, according to a Journal story, and expressed frustration with the state’s inaction on arming campus police. "What’s the holdup?" he said. "Who’s waiting for what tragedy?" Shibley’s claim intrigued us. Does the Ocean State really stand alone when it comes to allowing police on public campuses to carry guns? Let’s begin with some history. The Board of Governors for Higher Education first considered arming campus police at Rhode Island’s public institutions in 2000. URI conducted its own study two years later but decided that the time wasn’t right to make the move. In 2003, Brown -- a private institution -- decided to arm its police officers. Three years later, after the university’s sworn officers each received training in diversity, weapons and use-of-force, they were armed with semiautomatic pistols. The state Board of Governors formed a committee in 2008 to take another look at arming campus police in the wake of the 2007 killing of 32 people at Virginia Tech by a lone gunman, and other shootings at schools elsewhere in the country. In its March 22, 2010, report, the committee said that it had reached consensus that the Board of Governors should consider a plan to arm campus police at one or more of Rhode Island’s public institutions. But no action has been taken since then. When we called Shibley, a former police officer and assistant director of Rhode Island’s municipal police academy, he said he made the claim about the state’s singular status based on a fact sheet provided by Lt. Charles P. Wilson, a former police chief in Ohio, now the third shift patrol supervisor at the campus police department at Rhode Island College. The fact sheet states, "Where legislation enabling campus law enforcement is concerned, only [Rhode Island] has language which specifically restricts campus police from carrying firearms." Shibley urged us to contact Wilson, who, he said, had carried out years of research on the arming of campus police. Fifteen years, to be precise, said Wilson, who with his wife, Shirley A. Wilson, an associate professor of management at Bryant University, has written academic papers on general attitudes toward campus law enforcement and opposition to arming campus law enforcement. He sent a spreadsheet he compiled on law enforcement agencies at 2,050 four-year educational institutions around the country. The spreadsheet, which he said took three months to compile, was based on information gleaned from school web sites, correspondence with individual campus police officers, state and federal reports and some 200 phone calls. He said he plans to use the spreadsheet as the basis of a research paper. Wilson divided the schools according to whether they are private or public and also according to whether they have their own police officers on campus or instead use security guards. The latter is an important distinction. Campus police officers generally go through the same training as municipal police officers and learn how to safely handle guns. Security guards do not necessarily receive firearms training. Rhode Island’s public educational institutions all use campus police officers. All officers are trained in firearms as part of mandatory training at the municipal police academy. Of the 2,050 schools Wilson surveyed, 712 have police officers instead of security guards only. Of that number, 693 -- or 97 percent -- allow their officers to carry guns. We asked Wilson about Shibley’s claim. He told us that for years, three states were often cited as prohibiting their campus police officers from carrying guns: Rhode Island, Iowa and Oregon. But Iowa and Oregon have reversed their policies in recent years. The Iowa Board of Regents approved firearms for campus police on Oct. 31, 2007. Within two weeks, the police officers at Iowa State University were armed. And in Oregon last October, the state Board of Higher Education allowed the University of Oregon to convert public safety officers into full-fledged police who would be able to carry guns. But it’s important to note that campus police officers at the university currently are not armed. Wilson expects them to be issued firearms by the end of this year, but the school still needs approval from the Oregon Board of Higher Education to take that step. The only published survey we found that looked at firearms and campus law enforcement was done by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. The bureau released its most recent survey in February 2008. It was based on information collected about 750 four-year schools in 2004 and 2005. The survey supported Shibley’s premise -- that the majority of colleges that use police officers allow them to carry arms -- but it’s outdated and does not break out its results on a state-by-state basis. Our ruling Shibley said that Rhode Island is the only state that doesn’t arm the police officers at its public educational institutions. While Brown armed its officers six years ago, URI, CCRI and RIC haven’t followed suit. The vast majority of U.S. schools that have police officers let them carry guns. That’s a fact confirmed by the U.S. Department of Justice and by Wilson, the RIC police supervisor. Wilson is the only researcher we could locate who has broken down the issue by state, and according to his findings, Rhode Island is the lone hold out when it comes to allowing police at public schools to carry arms. But even though campus police in Oregon are allowed by law to carry guns, they are not carrying guns yet. That’s an important detail that Wilson accounted for in the fact sheet he gave Shibley. By glossing over this point, Shibley’s aim was slightly off the bull’s-eye, but he didn’t miss the target altogether. We rate the statement Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-04472	"In Romney's first budget (in Massachusetts), he cut $248.7 million from K-12 education."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/08/barack-obama/obama-ad-accuses-romney-cutting-mass-k-12-educatio/	A new Web ad from Barack Obama's campaign portrays Mitt Romney as a promise-breaker who cut Massachusetts education spending in his very first budget. The ad starts with grainy campaign video of Romney in 2002, saying, "The services delivered to our children in schools … we're not going to cut that." A reproachful Ronald Pacy, former superintendent in Attleboro, Mass., follows: "Gov. Romney said he was not going to cut education, and then the next thing we knew, those cuts were made." Then, in type on screen, the claim: In Romney's first budget, he cut $248.7 million from K-12 education. — Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, FY2004 Conference Budget, 6/26/03 We wondered, did Romney cut that amount from K-12 education right out of the gate? Massachusetts’ fiscal crisis In 2003, the new governor faced a fiscal emergency. Our colleagues at the Tampa Bay Times have examined Romney’s response to an economy still recovering from the dot-com bubble and the 9/11 recession. As Romney entered office, the state’s lawmakers — required to pass a balanced budget — faced a budget gap even after tax hikes and emergency spending cuts the year before. Romney got authority to make emergency cuts his first month and asked the Legislature to make more. Then he proposed a budget with savings of close to $3 billion. Did that include a $248.7 million cut from K-12 education? Not explicitly. But the budget he signed did. Budget games The number cited in the ad isn’t what Romney proposed. His state budget, in fact, suggested a modest overall increase of $8.9 million in two main categories of state K-12 spending. But he proposed a steep reduction in broader local spending that governments also used for education — a drop of $349.4 million, down nearly 30 percent from the prior year. The Democratic Legislature spread the cuts around differently, ultimately reducing those two education-specific categories by $248.7 million while restoring nearly half of broader "unrestricted" local aid. That’s the cut that ultimately survived Romney’s vetoes and the Legislature’s veto overrides. But none of that was clear from the report cited by the Obama team, which examined neither Romney’s proposal for fiscal year 2004 nor the budget that emerged after vetoes and veto overrides, but something in between known as the "conference budget." All three of those options were available in reports from the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, an independent, nonprofit think tank partly funded by unions that’s affiliated with the liberal Washington, D.C., Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The "conference" budget was the one that made it through the House and Senate and awaited the governor’s signature (and line-item veto). So, it’s a stretch to say any numbers in it were fully Romney’s. It was, in fact, more accurately the budget belonging to Democratic lawmakers who agreed on their own version — then generally blocked the governor’s vetoes. "The Democrats had veto-proof majorities in both chambers and rewrote Romney’s budget, as they have with all governors’ budgets, to what they wanted," Fred Bayles, director of the Boston University Statehouse Program told PolitiFact in May. Still, when Romney took his veto pen to that conference budget, he moved to chop millions more from the Legislature’s proposed school funding, including $10 million in kindergarten expansion grants (a cut overridden by lawmakers). Our ruling An Obama for America ad uses a big number to attack Romney’s record on school funding in Massachusetts, saying, "In Romney's first budget, he cut $248.7 million from K-12 education." "Romney’s first budget" sounds like a proposal coming from the governor. Romney actually proposed a modest increase in state K-12 spending categories and larger cuts elsewhere. The $248.7 million in education-specific cuts reflected primarily the work of the Democratic Legislature in a time of serious financial crisis that predated the governor. Romney, tasked with closing a substantial budget gap, ultimately signed a document that embodied the Legislature’s cuts — and then tried to use his veto to cut further. But he shares responsibility for that $248.7 million with the veto-proof majority of lawmakers. We rate the ad’s claim Half True.

pomt-05853	Says Milwaukee blacks have 55 percent male unemployment, 60 percent truancy, a 50 percent graduation rate, the "worst" reading scores and "lead" in infant mortality.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/13/david-clarke-jr/conservative-black-sheriff-says-milwaukee-blacks-h/	When an African-American tea party congressman held a "conservative black forum" on Capitol Hill on Jan. 23, 2012, the Milwaukee County sheriff was among the dozen panelists. David A. Clarke Jr. told the host, U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Florida, and a national C-SPAN audience about the woes of Wisconsin’s largest city. "I come from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a city with a lot of issues, a lot of issues," Clarke said in his opening remarks. Then he rattled off a set of startling statistics: "Fifty-five percent black male unemployment. Truancy rate of sixty percent -- sixty percent of students in the Milwaukee Public Schools system do not attend school regularly. They only graduate fifty percent of the students that do, and when they come out of there the diploma is not worth the paper that it's written on, and they probably can't even read it. We have the worst fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores in the nation. We lead in infant mortality rate and I could go on and on and on." Clarke is a Democrat in a largely Democratic county, but he is an outspoken conservative who often speaks bluntly about issues outside of law enforcement. So is the Milwaukee area really as bleak as the sheriff paints it? We’ll look at each of the five parts of Clarke’s claim: Unemployment, truancy, graduation rate, reading scores and infant mortality. Clarke's spokeswoman, Fran McLaughlin, confirmed that Clarke was speaking about African-Americans, rather than the total population, with the statistics he cited. She said Clarke’s statements were based on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stories, but she didn’t provide any specific one. Unemployment Clarke said Milwaukee has "55 percent black male unemployment." Does that mean the unemployment rate among black males is 55 percent? No. Clarke was likely referring to a Journal Sentinel article, published the same day as the forum, about a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study that reported an employment rate -- as opposed to the more commonly reported unemployment rate -- among black males. The study says nearly 45 percent of the area's black males ages 16 to 64 were employed in 2010. So, presumably the remaining 55 percent were unemployed. But the study arrived at its figures by counting virtually all black males, including those who aren’t actively looking for work, such as those who are incarcerated, disabled or full-time students. In contrast, unemployment -- the rate most commonly measured by the government and reported in the news media -- is based on the number people who are unemployed but actively looking for work. That’s a much smaller group. Indeed, the UWM study said that black male unemployment rate for metro Milwaukee in 2010 was 29.5 percent. So, this part of Clarke’s claim is misleading in that "black male unemployment" is far less than 55 percent. Truancy Clarke said the truancy rate among black students in Milwaukee Public Schools is 60 percent. The latest data from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, for the 2009-2010 school year, show 59.5 percent of black MPS students were habitually truant -- absent from school without an acceptable excuse for part or all of five or more days during a semester. So this part of Clark’s claim, rounded up a half-percentage point, is accurate. Graduation rate Clarke said the graduation rate among black Milwaukee Public Schools students is 50 percent. But, as a May 2011 Journal Sentinel article reported, the 2010 high school graduation rate for black MPS students was 59.5 percent, according to the latest available figures from the Department of Public Instruction. That means this part of Clarke’s claim is wrong. Reading scores Clarke said black Milwaukee Public Schools students have "the worst fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores in the nation." The Journal Sentinel reported in December 2011 on National Assessment of Educational Progress tests administered by the federal government in urban school districts. On the reading test, black fourth-graders in MPS tied with Cleveland for last place among 20 districts studied. Black MPS eighth-graders ranked 18th, ahead of the District of Columbia and Fresno, Calif. So, Clarke is a bit off on quoting the study. This part of his claim is also overstated in that the study considered only 20 school districts; the study doesn’t indicate whether MPS reading scores are among the worst for all U.S. districts. Infant mortality Clarke said "we lead" in black infant mortality. The Journal Sentinel reported in January 2011 on a Milwaukee Health Department study which found that, from 2005 through 2008, the black infant mortality rate in Milwaukee was 15.7 deaths for every 1,000 births -- 2.5 times higher than the white rate. The report said that for a slightly shorter period -- 2005-2007 -- Milwaukee’s black infant mortality rate was lower than Detroit’s and Philadelphia’s, but higher than many large cities, including New York, Chicago, St. Louis and Minneapolis. So, although the study didn’t cover a large number of cities, Clarke’s suggestion that Milwaukee is among cities with a higher black infant mortality rate is accurate. Our rating Clarke was correct in two parts of his claim: Black Milwaukee Public Schools students have a 60 percent truancy rate and Milwaukee has one of the higher black infant mortality rates among U.S. cities. Clarke was wrong in two parts. He overstated unemployment among black males in metro Milwaukee, which was 29.5 percent in 2010, and he understated the graduation rate among black MPS students; it is nearly 60 percent. On the remaining part of the claim, reading scores among black MPS students were nearly the worst among 20 school districts in a study. But that doesn’t mean they were the worst in the nation, which is what Clarke said. On balance, we rate Clarke’s statement Half True.	None	David A.

pomt-10827	"Took on the Olympics and turned them around"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/18/mitt-romney/the-effort-was-olympic/	In February 1999, Romney was called on to help bail out an Olympic effort that was marred by scandal. Sponsors wondered if they still wanted their names attached to the Games after it was revealed that Salt Lake City's host committee had showered gifts on the international group that had chosen the location. Investigations were underway. The Olympics were in serious trouble. Still, Romney's implication that he single-handedly rescued the Games is a sore subject in Utah. Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake organizing committee and a supporter of Romney's presidential bid, says Romney's commercial does overstate the problem. Garff says that contrary to Romney's ad, the Olympics were not bankrupt before he arrived. In addition, many of the Games' sponsors predated Romney's involvement, said Sydney Fonnesbeck, a former member of the Salt Lake City Council. "He just came in and gathered the money that was already (pledged)," she said. Fonnesbeck said Romney alienated some people with whom he worked during the Games. "He didn't want to give anyone else any credit," she said. "We became nobodies. A lot of us were hurt and angry. It didn't surprise any of us when he ran home and ran for governor." And yet, Romney did play a decisive role in righting the troubled Olympics. Richard Pound, a Montreal attorney and a member of the International Olympic Committee, said someone had to take charge and make decisions or the Games would have been a disaster. That's what Romney did. "There were good people in the organization, but for them to have been able to do the many things that needed to be done, they needed a good leader who could make decisions and empower them," Pound said. Romney scored a big win early in his effort to preserve the Olympic luster by helping to convince John Hancock to remain a sponsor. Stephen A. Greyser, a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School and a specialist in sports marketing, said the Olympic brand itself had been at stake. "It was Mitt Romney who was, in essence, Mr. Integrity," Greyser said. In the end, we cannot award a fully True ruling to Romney's claim when even his supporters say his claim is a little overstated. But there is nothing to dispute that Romney played a vital role in rescuing a very troubled Olympic games and that's why we're rating his claim Mostly True.

pomt-12560	Says President Barack Obama "tax audit exposes MILLIONS in offshore accounts stolen from taxpayers."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/14/blog-posting/fake-theory-barack-obama-hid-millions-taxpayer-dol/	Former President Barack Obama somehow fleeced American taxpayers for millions of dollars and hid the money in offshore bank accounts using an alias, a fake news story claimed. "Obama tax audit exposes MILLIONS in offshore accounts stolen from taxpayers," read the headline on an April 4, 2017, post on FederalistTribune.com. Facebook users flagged the story for possibly being fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. Out of the gate, we’ll note the story is fake. It said that the United States Treasury paid $411 million for "Royalty Payments for Obamacare" to a limited liability corporation owned by someone named Barry Soetero. The money was for the author of Obamacare for "expenses and royalties associated with naming the bill." The story said Obama was the bill’s author and therefore, he is the one collecting this $411 million. The conspiratorial implication is that Obama actually is Soetoro. (Soetoro is the name of Obama's stepfather, Lolo Soetoro.) FederalistTribune.com said the money was split among accounts in the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Caledonia. That last one is actually the name the Roman Empire gave to the region that is now Scotland. Among other claims in the disjointed post is a citation for an April 4 missive on FreedomsFinalStand.com, which said Obama had denied using the Soetoro alias many times. FreedomsFinalStand.com said that these contrived royalty payments were stopped after Obamacare was renamed the Affordable Care Act. That’s a patently absurd assertion about the law officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and was later dubbed Obamacare by skeptical Republicans to taunt Obama. But let’s go back even farther: It appears this post first breached the Internet as a March 11 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site we know was designed to troll conservatives with faux news made up to stoke ire on political issues. The parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. The site’s articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, usually without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, either. But its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." It’s difficult to say whether the other sites are in on the joke or not. FederalistTribune.com’s Contact Us link doesn’t seem to perform any action, and FreedomsFinalStand.com doesn’t appear to have contact information at all. Both sites are privately registered, with no personal contact information. At any rate, the tale of Obama using an alias to bilk millions from the U.S. Treasury for naming his signature health care law was made up. We rate the statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-00664	"Transgender individuals in the U.S. have a 1-in-12 chance of being murdered."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/may/13/garnet-coleman/garnet-coleman-said-transgender-person-has-1-12-ch/	State Rep. Garnet Coleman brought up murder in urging colleagues to add acts against transgender Texans to the state’s hate-crimes law. "The facts do not lie," the Houston Democrat said in a May 6, 2015, hearing held by the Texas House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence. Coleman, suggesting transgender Americans are more likely to be attacked, went on: "Transgender individuals in the U.S. have a 1-in-12 chance of being murdered. The average person has a 1-in-18,000 chance." His House Bill 2059 would add "gender identity or expression" to what a judge or jury could consider to declare an action a hate crime. We asked Coleman to elaborate on his declaration about the chances of a transgender resident, meaning a person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth, being murdered. In a written statement we fielded by email, Coleman said the 1-in-12 figure turned out not to have a factual basis. In preparing his presentation, Coleman said, he drew the 1-in-12 element from Equality Texas, a group that says it advocates for "full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Texans." Coleman also told us a 2012 Human Rights Campaign press release no longer posted online publicized the seemingly unsupported 1-in-12 statistic. We shared Coleman’s response with Equality Texas and the Human Rights Campaign, which says it focuses on achieving equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Chuck Smith of Equality Texas confirmed it gave Coleman the figure. A campaign spokesman, Adam Talbot, replied by email that he couldn’t find any sign of the group bandying the 1-in-12 formulation. By phone, Coleman said: "The information is false; it’s not verifiable." We took our own look. Chances of a murder We recognized, for starters, that counting the number of murders across the population isn’t the same as calculating the chances of any member of a subgroup getting murdered. Various factors come into play including where someone lives and works, for instance. Regardless, Coleman told us the 1-in-18,000 general chances of murder in the United States he mentioned was based on FBI-collected figures for murders in 2000. By email, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer guided us to an agency chart showing 15,586 murders and nonnegligent homicides in 2000 when the U.S. had 281,421,906 residents, which suggests 1 in 18,056 residents were murdered. According to the most recent compiled data on the chart, in 2013, the 14,196 murders/nonnegligent homicides within the U.S. population of 316,128,839 residents suggests there was one person murdered for every 22,269 residents. Fischer pointed us to another FBI chart stating that nationally in 2013, law enforcement agencies tallied 5,928 hate-crime incidents with 1,233 incidents traced to bias against the victim’s sexual orientation. Some 277 incidents were categorized as anti-lesbian, anti-gay, anti-bisexaul, or anti-transgender, the chart says. Separately, of 31 gender-identity hate crimes, according to the chart, 23 were anti-transgender and 8 were anti-gender-nonconforming (referring to a person who does not conform to the gender-based expectations of society as in a woman dressed in traditionally male clothing or a man wearing makeup). According to another FBI chart, none of the tallied 2013 victims of anti-transgender or anti-gender-nonconforming bias hate crimes were murdered. More recently, a March 2015 web post by the Human Rights Campaign and the Trans People of Color Coalition said that between January 2015 and March 10, 2015, at least seven transgender women were murdered in the U.S--after 13 transgender women were murdered in 2014. Smith from Equality Texas suggested by email that the 1-in-12 statistic originated in a master’s degree thesis written in the 1990s by a Californian, Kay Brown, who gave a course on transgender history based on her thesis, it appeared. However, neither Smith nor we could find a copy nor did we confirm any of these details. Next, some 11 months after we published this fact check, we heard by email from Brown, who said she once reached a "back-of-the-envelope" estimate on the chances of an androphilic (exclusively attracted to men) male-to-female transexual person being murdered. Brown said that result, which was not in a master’s thesis, evidently morphed elsewhere into a transgender murder rate. Brown also brought to our attention her August 2013 blog post on the topic. Separately, none of several online posts pointed out by Smith identified a factual basis for the 1-in-12. Notably, a May 2012 blog post by Christina Stephens of Missouri described her failed attempts to find a substantive basis. Stephens and others writing online speculated the statistic was referring to lifetime chances of being murdered with writer Parker Marie Molloy concluding in November 2013 that if estimates of the share of U.S. residents who are transgender are accurate, it’s not numerically reasonable for the 1-in-12 figure to hold up. A 2009 web post by the Washington, D.C.-based National Center for Transgender Equality, which calls itself the "nation’s leading social justice advocacy organization winning life-saving change for transgender people," said that no agencies tally transgender residents and many aren’t public about their identities, but the center estimates that up to 1 percent of the population is transsexual. Even if one presumes the 1-in 12 statistic reflects the lifetime chances of getting murdered, Molloy called it "extremely unlikely" to be correct. "Far too many trans people find themselves the victims of anti-transgender violence," Molloy concluded, "but luckily for us, it’s not 1 out of every 12 of us." Other research Thinking others might have sorted this out, we turned to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs whose latest report on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and HIV-affected hate violence, published in May 2014, covered U.S. conditions the year before. The report was based on public data and information provided by 14 member-groups including the Montrose Center in Houston, which means incidents were undercounted, the authors wrote. Overall, the report said, anti-LGBTQ and HIV-affected homicides in 2013 were down 28 percent from the year before, totaling 18 compared with 25 in 2012. But for the third year in a row, the report said, "transgender, transgender people of color, and LGBTQ and HIV-affected people of color experienced disproportionately severe violence." Thirteen of the 2013 victims were transgender women, the report said. The report also said: "Unfortunately, data on the prevalence of hate violence against queer, bisexual, transgender and HIV-affected people is virtually non-existent." Also disconcerting, the report said, its 2013 report documented over 600 more survivors and victims of hate violence through 2012 than the FBI had (1,376 survivors and victims compared to 2,001 survivors and victims). We also reached Vincent Villano, spokesman for the National Center for Transgender Equality. By phone, Villano expressed unfamiliarity with the 1-in-12 figure. "There really isn’t any data available out there," Villano said. Our ruling Coleman told colleagues: "Transgender individuals in the U.S. have a 1 in 12 chance of being murdered." We’re not judging here whether transgender individuals are at risk of attack. But we did not find evidence for this figure or even sufficient information to gauge if it was rooted in facts. All told, Coleman's claim was both unsupported and implausible. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-06222	Says Sen. Sherrod Brown "voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/dec/06/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-commerce-targets-sherrod-brown-votes-en/	There’s not much love lost between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown. Nearly a year before Brown, a Democrat from Avon, Ohio, is up for re-election, the world’s largest business federation has targeted him with a pair of negative television ads as it launched a nationwide 2012 election effort the group promises will be the "largest voter education and grassroots mobilization campaign in its nearly 100 year history." The Chamber says it spent more than $1 million on the initial round of political ads that target races in Ohio, Iowa, Montana, Washington, Pennsylvania and Nevada. The first Ohio ad criticizing Brown on energy issues started to run Nov. 16. Claiming that Washington’s energy policies could leave Ohio families in the cold this winter, it says: "When Sherrod Brown had the chance to help cut energy costs, he said no. Instead, Brown voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes." Over the Thanksgiving weekend, the group substituted a second ad with an illustration of Brown peeking through window blinds as an announcer suggests he’s "hiding from his tax-raising, job killing record." It goes onto assert that Brown "supports raising energy taxes." It also faults his votes for last year’s health care reform law. Both ads tell voters to call Brown’s office. Chamber spokesman J.P. Fielder says Brown is being targeted because his 9 percent level of support for U.S. Chamber voting positions is among the U.S. Senate’s lowest. "With the economy in the state it is in, and notably, the way the economy is in Ohio, we think it is all the more important to highlight for voters where candidates stand on business issues," Fielder said. Since energy was sole topic of the Chamber’s first ad and a key point of its second one, PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. We’re focusing on the group’s claim in the first ad that Brown voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes. The chamber cited votes that Brown made on May 17 and May 18 of this year. One of those votes was on a measure that would have eliminated $12 billion in tax breaks to big oil companies over 10 years as a way to reduce the budget deficit. It targeted five companies: Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, Conoco Phillips, and BP. Republicans, like Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, argued its passage would increase gasoline costs and reduce domestic oil production. Democrats, like California’s Barbara Boxer, contended the measure would not raise consumer prices because the oil companies are flush enough with profits to forsake such "corporate welfare." Despite Brown’s backing, It failed to get enough votes to warrant Senate consideration. The second measure - which also failed to get enough votes to warrant full U.S. Senate consideration - would have expanded offshore oil and gas drilling. Brown opposed bringing it to the Senate floor. Republicans, like Utah’s Orrin Hatch, predicted the measure would reduce energy prices and the nation’s reliance on foreign oil. Democrats, like Robert Menendez of New Jersey, said the plan would cut oil prices by a mere three cents a gallon in 20 years while risking spill damage on the nation’s coasts. PolitiFact previously has found that new domestic drilling won’t have much impact on oil prices much because of the many years it would take to realize production gains and because any contribution to the global oil market would be too small to significantly shrink prices. Fielder said the claim that Brown supports raising energy taxes, which is made in each ad, also is derived from a third vote he cast. Brown opposed an April 2009 budgetary amendment that would raise a parliamentary point of order against any legislation that would impose a national energy tax on individual taxpayers who make $200,000 or less, or couples with a top income of $250,000. According to the U.S. Senate website, a point of order is "a claim made by a Senator from the floor that a rule of the Senate is being violated. If the chair sustains the point of order, the action in violation of the rule is not permitted." Brown spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak said the measure Brown voted against "wouldn’t affect energy taxes by one dime" because it was a procedural amendment to prevent any Congressional debate over energy issues. Where does that leave the Chamber’s allegation that "Brown voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes"? There is an element of truth in the claim. Brown’s vote to repeal tax breaks to big oil companies could be deemed a vote to "increase energy taxes." But those taxes would be on big oil companies - not the Ohioans whom the ad says "need economic help, not higher energy taxes." PolitiFact has noted in previous items that the assertion that Brown’s opposition to the offshore drilling measure was "a chance to help cut energy costs" is dubious, since the consumer price impact of offshore drilling would be minimal and in the far future. And the Chamber argues that Brown’s opposition to establishing a parliamentary "point of order" against debating energy tax legislation means that he "supports raising energy taxes." But that’s not what that vote was about. His vote indicates that he wouldn’t bar discussion of such ideas, not that he supports them.

pomt-04343	Says Mitt Romney wants to add $2 trillion to defense budget that the military hasn’t asked for.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/24/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-spend-2-trilllion-military/	Republican nominee Mitt Romney has said he plans to increase defense spending by about $2 trillion over the next 10 years if he’s elected president. In the final debate of the campaign, moderator Bob Scheiffer asked Romney, "Where are you going to get the money?" Romney said he would take it from other parts of the budget -- by abolishing Obamacare and by changing Medicaid to a block grant and turning it over to the states. President Barack Obama said Romney’s plan for more defense spending is a bad idea, because it isn’t necessary. Romney "wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for," Obama said. In this fact-check, we examine the claim that Romney is promoting something the top brass don’t want. Romney has outlined out his national security policy on his website. There, he warned that restoring the military "will not be a cost-free process," and said he will "begin by reversing Obama-era defense cuts ... with the goal of setting core defense spending — meaning funds devoted to the fundamental military components of personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and research and development — at a floor of 4 percent of GDP." What’s 4 percent worth? The Pentagon’s budget is expected to run in the range of 3.2 to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year. According to the Center for a New American Security, a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations, even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by $2.1 trillion over the next ten years, as reported by CNN. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction, uses that number too, as do other budget think tanks. Romney seems to accept it, so as far as the $2 trillion figure goes, it seems reasonably accurate. In the past, when asked about increasing defense spending in tough economic times, the Romney campaign has emphasized that the 4-percent goal will take some time to achieve. While the campaign website describes the goal as "a floor", campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it "a target" in an email to a Boston Globe reporter. The first priority, Saul wrote, is to reverse "Obama-era defense cuts." In the same article, one Romney adviser, Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, "That’s not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is. It would have to be a very slow ramp-up and they would be hard-pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term.’’ This suggests there is some flexibility on Romney’s part, although the candidate himself has not expressed that. What the Pentagon is asking for In the debate, Romney said, "Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We're now at under 285." In fact, the 313-ship plan reflects a 2005 strategic review. In April, the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, presented a new program that sets a goal of 300 ships. Mabus’s remarks came at a moment when Romney had been vocal in his opposition to the new approach. "A lot of this criticism is based on either incomplete and/or inaccurate or outdated information, or a failure to see beyond the short term or a willingness to protect the status quo in spite of the changing world and in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary," he said. The president’s budget calls for $487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021. His defense secretary, Leon Panetta, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have both spoken up for the plan, as have the heads of all five branches of the military. "We are developing today the Joint Force the nation will need in 2020," Dempsey told the Senate budget committee. "We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time—to win any conflict, anywhere." Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the department’s plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face. "The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nation's fiscal situation.," Panetta told the budget committee. "We are at that point in history. That's the reality of the world we live in." Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said, "the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget, and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts." The president is the commander-in-chief. Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him. To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation, the chain of command says it all. But in the past, when military commanders have disagreed with presidents, they have found ways to get their complaints to the public. This is not to say that all commanders are pleased with the trade-offs they face. But Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security, said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military, and by and large, the commanders support the plan. "It’s hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this," Bensahel said. Broadly speaking, it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits. Our ruling The president said Romney planned to increase defense spending by $2 trillion and that was money the military hadn’t asked for. Military leaders have testified in support of the president’s spending plan, and we found no evidence of disagreement behind the scenes. We rate the statement True.

pomt-13967	"There are tens of thousands of homes right here in California where you turn on the faucet but you can't drink the water."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/14/bernie-sanders/lack-reliable-tally-epa-california-hinder-bernie-s/	The wisdom of using hydraulic fracking, the controversial process of squeezing oil and gas out of rock using pressured fluid, has been one of the issues that separates Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, with Sanders advocating an outright ban on the technique. Sanders repeated his opposition during a news conference in Spreckels, Calif., in Monterey County, and said it was part of a larger concern about the availability of clean water, which he characterized as "one of the looming crises" in the United States and around the world. "It is not just Flint, Mich., that is struggling with clean water. It is hundred of communities all over this country," he said. "There are tens of thousands of homes right here in California where you turn on the faucet, but you can't drink the water." "They have to bring in bottled water, and, by the way, at great expense," Sanders said. "And if we do not act aggressively on fracking and other issues, this problem will only spread." (There was a moment of confusion during Sanders' comments when someone to Sanders' left injected a comment and, based on that, Sanders said it was tens of thousands just in that county. When we contacted that other person, environmental lawyer Gary Alan Patton, he told PolitiFact that he and Sanders misunderstood each other and the "tens of thousands" was not a county number.) For this fact-check, we will look at whether Sanders correctly reported the scope of the problem in California as a whole. The short answer: We couldn't find any clear data. The federal Environmental Protection Agency — with a budget of over $9 billion — said it doesn't have a running tally of households or individuals in the United States or by state who can't drink their tap water. EPA referred us to California's EPA and its State Water Resources Control Board. They don't have a tally either. What the control board does have is an annual report covering 2014 with numbers that are only suggestive of the scope of the drinking water problem in California's 7,789 public water systems. It focuses on the 167 water systems in the state that have had drinking water violations. The only time it counts people is in the sections that list water systems with arsenic, nitrate and nitrite contamination. By our tally, in 2014, 168 water systems serving 158,354 residents were cited at least once for high arsenic concentration. An additional 124 systems serving 36,652 residents were cited for high concentrations of nitrate or nitrite, substances common in fertilizers. In total, those water systems serve just over 195,000 people. With an average household size of 2.58 people, that would be about 75,600 households, putting Sanders in the "tens of thousands" ballpark. The problem is saying a water system has been cited for violations in 2014 doesn’t mean those households don’t have drinkable tap water. Some of those violations may have since been corrected. Some of those water systems may have adjusted for the contamination. Consider contamination with arsenic, the legendary poison that, in small doses over a long period of time can cause diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The element usually comes from the erosion of natural deposits. We contacted people in two of the largest systems cited for arsenic contamination. In Arvin, Calif., the levels are so high, the 18,000 or so residents supplied by local water district are drinking bottled or filtered water provided by the city. The schools, parks and the library, for example, have their water filtered. The city is working on three new wells to try to correct the longstanding problem. Yet a few miles northwest, in Lamont, which serves a population of 18,290, people are drinking the water in spite of one well with high arsenic levels. That well is shut down, so the tap water is drinkable. Water district officials are hoping a new well will have low levels so they can blend it with the now-offline well to dilute the arsenic. "We never had a case where people had to purchase water because it was unsafe to drink," said Rolando Marquez, water system supervisor. Point being, they shouldn't be included in any count to assess whether Sanders is correct. But there's another factor that makes the state report even less reliable as a gauge of how many California residents have tap water that's not safe to drink. Between 660,000 and 2 million people in the state rely on unregulated water from home wells that may also be polluted and don't have to be tested. People may be drinking it because the cost to homeowners to treat that water may be prohibitively high. The only official estimate we could find for the state was a 2013 news release from the state water board reporting that, "More than 95 percent of California’s 38 million residents get their drinking water from a public water supply and, of that number, 98 percent are served safe drinking water, according to CDPH," the acronym for the California Department of Public Health. If that means 2 percent are served unsafe drinking water, that works out to about 722,000 residents or roughly 280,000 households. That's hundreds of thousands, not tens of thousands. If that estimate is correct, Sanders is low-balling the tap water pollution problem in The Golden State. When we contacted the Sanders campaign, they didn't have any hard numbers either, just media reports, including an Associated Press story about 2 million people living near groundwater containing uranium (but that's untreated water and the number goes beyond California), another AP story reporting that 57 water systems in California had too much lead in their drinking water (but no indication on how many households they served) and a story from the Visalia Times Delta saying that nearly one fifth of groundwater used for public drinking supplies is polluted (again, that's before treatment). Our ruling Sanders said, "There are tens of thousands of homes right here in California where you turn on the faucet, but you can't drink the water." But surprisingly, neither the federal nor state governments has a reliable tally for public water supplies, never mind private wells that are not regulated. Clearly California has a lot of polluted water, but in many cases that water can be treated or mixed with unpolluted water to bring the contaminants down to safe levels. Thus, the number of households with undrinkable tap water remains uncertain. Sanders is right about the problem but his assessment of its scope — tens of thousands of households — lacks good data. For that reason, we rate it Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a0479acd-8a2a-47f7-9b7e-93ba460d5c1c	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-06-14T13:41:37	2016-06-01	['California']
pomt-08103	"Barack Obama is in an economy that's only worsened since he's been president of the United States."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/13/matthew-dowd/matthew-dowd-says-economy-has-only-worsened-under-/	During the Dec. 12, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Matthew Dowd, a former strategist for President George W. Bush who lives south of Austin, said that "Barack Obama is in an economy that's only worsened since he's been president of the United States." With a wealth of economic statistics available, we thought Dowd's comment offered a good opportunity to take stock of how well the economy has actually performed since the start of Obama's presidency. We'll acknowledge that there is no perfect mix of economic statistics. That said, here are a few that some economists we spoke to believed were good measures of the economy under Obama. First, we'll look at the factors that have shown improvement. • Gross Domestic Product. There have been seven quarters since Obama was inaugurated. During his first two quarters, GDP shrank -- by 4.9 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. (GDP also shrank during three of the previous four quarters, when George W. Bush was in office.) But during the ensuing five quarters under Obama, it's risen -- by 1.6 percent, 5.0 percent, 3.7 percent, 1.7 percent and 2.5 percent. Most of these are fairly meager rates of growth, but it's hard to argue that they show the economy getting worse. • Earnings and income. Personal income was more than 4 percent higher in the third quarter of 2010 than it was in the first quarter of 2009. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings and average weekly earnings for private workers are almost 8 percent higher and three-tenths of 1 percent higher, respectively, than they were when Obama was sworn in. Some of these gains are modest, but they are gains nonetheless. • Industrial production. Industrial production has increased by a little over 4 percent since Obama's inauguration, though today's level is still lower than it was in 2007. • The stock market. The stock market is one step removed from basic economic indicators, but it does show what investors think about the prospects for the broader economy. And since Obama was inaugurated, it's been going like gangbusters. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by a whopping 44 percent between Jan. 20, 2009, and Dec. 12, 2010. And the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index -- a broader indicator of the domestic stock market -- rose by more than 61 percent over the same period. This all sounds promising, but it would be premature to call Dowd incorrect. Here are some factors that have gotten worse on the president's watch: • The housing market. If you compare existing home sales for the first 10 months of 2009 with the first 10 months of 2010, the number of sales was about 3 percent lower in 2010. In the meantime, the foreclosure situation is getting worse. The number of foreclosure filings in October 2010 was 21 percent higher than the level in January 2009. • Personal bankruptcies. The level of personal bankruptcies was 26 percent higher in the third quarter of 2010 than it was in the first quarter of 2009. (However, business bankruptcies did decline by about 2.5 percent over the same period.) And finally, the biggie: • The jobs picture. The unemployment rate has risen from 7.7 percent in January 2009 to 9.8 percent in October 2010. If you drill deeper into the statistics, these woes are reflected in almost every subsample of the population. White? Up from 7.0 percent to 8.9 percent. Black? Up from 12.8 percent to 16 percent. Hispanic? Up from 9.9 percent to 13.2 percent. The same goes for Americans with varying levels of educational attainment. Those without a high school degree saw unemployment rise from 12.4 percent to 15.7 percent. High school grads saw it increase from 8.1 percent to 10 percent. Those with some college training rose from 6.4 percent to 8.7 percent. And college graduates saw their unemployment rise from 3.9 percent to 5.1 percent. The trends for long-term unemployment have been especially dispiriting. The median duration of unemployment has doubled from 10.6 weeks to 21.6 weeks, while the number of "discouraged workers" -- those no longer actively seeking employment -- has risen by almost 75 percent. The sole bright spot in the labor market affects those Americans who already have a job. Earnings have increased, as indicated above, and the "separations rate" -- that is, the number of voluntary and involuntary departures from a job as a percentage of the work force -- has fallen from 3.8 percent to 3.1 percent. That means that if you already have a job, you're less likely to lose it than you were in early 2009. But if you don't have a job, it's become no easier to get one under Obama. Put it all together and you have an economy that has both improved and gotten worse since Obama's inauguration. "Almost certainly the economy is still growing, meaning that it has expanded, though at a disappointing rate," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the liberal-to-centrist Brookings Institution. "Only in upside-down world could this be described as 'an economy that's only worsened' after January 2009. Since the summer of 2009 the economy has certainly improved, but at a disappointingly slow rate." Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, said the statement is false based on statistics. But he added that Dowd is on safer ground if one compares the "Obama recovery" to past recoveries, which have been characterized by stronger rebounds. When we asked Dowd for his thoughts, he said that some weight had to be given to the views of the American people. And to take just one example, a recent Bloomberg poll found that 35 percent of respondents thought they were better off than they were two years ago, 51 percent thought they were worse off and 14 percent were unsure. Similarly, while the poll found almost even approval ratings for Obama generally -- 47 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove -- his rating on the economy was far worse, at only 41 percent approve, 54 percent disapprove. J.D. Foster, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact that the two most important factors to look at are GDP and jobs, and these two divide just as neatly as the other factors, with one pointing to an improved economy and the other pointing to an economy that has gotten worse. There's evidence on both sides, so we'll split the difference and rate Dowd's statement Half True.	None	Matthew Dowd	None	None	None	2010-12-13T17:57:47	2010-12-12	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-14990	"Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/13/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-united-states-has-more-people-jail-/	Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders argued that part of what holds the country back is it spends far too much money keeping people behind bars. Those dollars, he said in the first Democratic debate, could do much more good. "Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth," Sanders said. "It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration, maybe, just maybe, we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids." We take Sanders’ use of the word "jail" to included prisons. The United States is the third most-populous nation -- China and India are way ahead with about four times as many people. Do we really incarcerate more people than any other country? The latest numbers say we do. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2013 there were more than 2.2 million people in local jails, and state and federal prisons. It’s a little harder to get rock solid numbers internationally. The United Nations collects some information, but it covers only about 50 countries, and it doesn’t include China. Fortunately, the Institute for Criminal Policy Research based at the School of Law at Birkbeck at the University of London, has gathered more comprehensive data. By its tally, China has about 1.65 million prisoners. That places it second behind the United States. Russia comes in third, with about 655,000 prisoners. The UN data says Russia has about 700,000 prisoners but that includes people held without a final sentencing decision. China’s incarcerated population could very well be higher, the center notes. Chinese government officials reported in 2009 that more than 650,000 people were being held in detention centers around China on top of the count for sentenced prisoners. If that number was the same in mid 2013, the total prison population would be more than 2.3 million in China, pushing it above the United States. But we can’t settle that possibility here. A better way to compare prison populations worldwide is to measure a country’s prison population as a share of the national population, experts told us. Adjusted for population, the United States’ prison population (707 prisoners per 100,000 population) exceeds countries around its size, including China. But according to the latest data, it ranks second -- not first -- worldwide. First place goes to the tiny nation of Seychelles, which posts the highest rate of 868 prisoners per 100,000 population based on the most recent data. Peter Wagner is executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit group that supports reducing the prison population. Wagner told PolitiFact in February the countries are not at all in the same league. Seychelles is a group of African islands in the Indian Ocean northeast of Madagascar and is home to just over 90,000 people. For perspective, the least populous U.S. state is Wyoming with more than 580,000 residents. The addition of 240 Seychellois from 2012 to 2014 into an already small prison population dramatically pushes the rate from 707 prisoners per 100,000 population to 868, overtaking the United States. "I think countries that small are just not comparable," Wagner said, adding that his group’s 2014 States of Incarceration report filtered out countries with less than a half-million residents. Our ruling Sanders said that America has more people in jail than any other country. It’s likely he means the population in state and federal prisons, along with those in local jails. The latest federal census found more than 2.2 million people behind bars in the United States. A research center in England reports that China ranks second with about 1.65 million prisoners. But the Chinese figure fails to include many thousands of people in detention centers, and we don’t know how many that would be. Regardless, based on population size, America has an incarceration rate higher than any other nation. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-00681	"When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/07/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-we-had-lowest-net-worth-any-president/	Former President Bill Clinton is back to making claims about his family’s humble financial roots. A year ago, he was defending Hillary Clinton for claiming that they left left the White House "not only dead broke, but in debt" (which rates Mostly False). "I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office," Clinton said then (Half True). This time, it’s amid scrutiny of all those lucrative speeches and foreign government donations to his family foundation. "I'm grateful for our success," Clinton told NBC News’ Cynthia McFadden in an interview that aired May 4. "But let me remind you. When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman." So, did Bill do better by isolating on presidents since Harry Truman? The answer is yes. A humble haberdasher, Harry S. Truman Detailed financial disclosures were not required for presidents through the 1970s, so we’re left to rely on other resources to get a picture of a commander-in-chief’s financial assets, said Paul Brace, a professor of political science at Rice University. Still, we do know a lot about their lives. Let’s start with Truman since he’s critical. Truman and his wife Bess were not homeowners when he became president. They rented a Washington apartment, and Bess’ mother, who owned the Independence, Mo., home associated with Harry Truman, shared a room with their daughter Margaret, said Alonzo Hamby, a Truman biographer and Ohio University emeritus professor of history. Truman’s journey to public office followed bankruptcy-dodging and a failed haberdashery business in the 1920s. He worked his way up from county judge to a U.S. senator, vice president and president upon Franklin D. Roosevelt’s death in 1945. Even when he was earning $10,000 as a senator in 1935 ($171,000 in 2015 dollars), he could not save the family farm his mother owned. It was Truman’s post-White House flirtation with bankruptcy that inspired Congress to pass presidential pensions, said Aaron Crawford, a post-doctoral student at Southern Methodist University. Experts can’t pinpoint his net worth to a specific dollar figure, but all the evidence points to the number being quite low. Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, explored Truman’s financial highs and lows using tax returns released by his presidential library. The man from Hope, and his pre-White House wallet The Clintons are certainly unique compared to other first families in modern history for a couple big reasons: They did not inherit sizable family estates, and Hillary Clinton was the family breadwinner as Bill worked as a career politician. Before running for the White House in 1992, Clinton brought in $35,000 a year as Arkansas governor, plus some speaking fees, honorariums and in-kind income, such as living in the governor’s residence. Hillary was a senior partner in the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock at the time, earned $92,000 salary and listed her share of her law firm’s profit-sharing and retirement plan between $100,001 and $250,000, according to a New York Times examination of the couple’s finances in 1992. The Clintons listed their net worth as nearly $700,000 in a 1992 statement, a substantial hike from the $418,692 net worth reported at the end of the 1989, according to the Washington Post. Lest you worry about the financial wealth of the Clintons, the family was still well off by most any standard. The median household net worth for Americans in 2013 was $81,200 (see page 12), according to the Federal Reserve. Other presidents since Truman The experts we contacted didn’t rattle off hard numbers as they dissected various presidents’ pre-office net worth. Instead, they ruled out the obviously wealthy presidents based on their jobs and family situations. (Truman biographer Hamby used the phrases, "JFK of course was quite rich," "Reagan was at least quite affluent," and "George H.W. Bush was at least wealthy if not filthy rich.") Eliminating the obvious, experts focused on who might present Clinton with a realistic challenge. Richard Nixon? He had a pretty lucrative law practice in New York. Lyndon B. Johnson? Journalists and historians disagree on exactly how he built his wealth, experts said, but he at least married a wealthy woman whose father owned Texas radio stations. Dwight D. Eisenhower? Nah, they said, as he was doing well for himself after World War II, landing on corporate boards and enjoying a good military pension and sales of his memoir, Crusade in Europe. "You save the world, you get good royalties," said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. Most encouraged us to give presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford a closer look. Carter had earned a good living as the owner of a peanut warehouse business in Georgia before running for the state Senate in 1962, said Scott Kaufman, a scholar of Ford and Carter at Francis Marion University. In 1979’s Jimmy Carter: A Character Portrait, authors Bruce Mazlish and Edwin Diamond wrote that Carter’s fortune was $814,000 when he became president, Kaufman said. That bests Clinton, without even having to break out the inflation calculator. A separate source — a 1976 Washington Post article sent over by the Hillary Clinton campaign — showed Carter had a net worth (when valuing assets at their original cost) of $512,000, which translates to $1.3 million in 1992 dollars, according to 1975 tax returns he released during his campaign against Ford. A document from the Gerald R. Ford presidential library suggests Ford had a more modest net worth compared to other presidents. The document, dated Oct. 29, 1973, (the year before Ford became president), showed a net worth of $256,378, which had the same buying power as about $810,000 in 1992. That’s more than the Clintons, though not by much. Ford’s finances and dealings were part of the most intense background checks for anyone ever screened for the vice presidency, Kaufman said, coming off the resignation of Nixon vice president Spiro Agnew earlier that month and amid looming worries about legal implications for Nixon in the Watergate scandal. "They didn’t want to appoint someone who might also have problems," Kaufman said. Our ruling Bill Clinton urged Americans to remember the Clintons’ more modest beginnings with his family’s fattened finances in the limelight, saying, "When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman." You can decide whether his point is relevant, but Clinton has improved the accuracy of his factoid since making a similar claim last year. We could not find evidence of a president after Truman whose inflation-adjusted net worth was smaller than the Clintons’. We rate his claim True.

pomt-12615	Government orders South African firm "to lay off 3,389 white employees."	false	/global-news/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/no-south-african-officials-didnt-order-white-layof/	Facebook users set the fake news flags waving when a 2015 news item resurfaced recently. The headline from a website with the URL conservative-headlines.com said, "South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employees." "A South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce its number of white employees by 44.3 percent over the next five years," the article said. "This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal ‘Black Empowerment’ program." The headline misses the mark on its main points, but behind it lie real events. PolitiFact Global News Service examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life." The conservative-headlines.com website, which features images of the Confederate flag and an op-ed in favor of a white "ethnostate" in South Africa, took its story from a prominent Afrikaans language news site Netwerk 24. Netwerk 24 was reporting on the affirmative action plans of Eskom, South Africa’s public electric company. South Africa operates under the Employment Equity Act, which says "employers must make sure designated groups (black people, women and people with disabilities) have equal opportunities in the workplace." Netwerk 24 reported the 3,389 figure based, it said, on documents Eskom had submitted to three unions. One of the unions, Solidarity, describes itself has having "a close relationship with the Afrikaner community." Solidarity opposes "reverse racism," and regularly tangles with the government over affirmative action. The factual part of the claim is this: In November 2014, the South African Labor Department sent Eskom a report telling it to set numerical targets so that the makeup of its workforce would more closely match that of the country at large. The company had to submit a plan to reach those targets by 2020. The report itself doesn’t give a number. But if Eskom didn’t come up with a plan and implement it, then the Labor Department could bring a case against it in the government’s Labor Court and seek to impose a fine. We asked the Solidarity union where it got the figure of 3,389 whites and spokesman Francois Redelinghuys told us "this number was derived from the employment equity plan Eskom submitted whereby it was envisioned that by 2020 they aim to reduce the amount of white workers as part of their affirmative action strategy." Redelinghuys didn’t tell us how the number was derived. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe told us, meanwhile, that "there is no such plan" to layoff white workers. In Eskom’s 2016 annual report, the company lays out the workforce makeup it hopes to achieve by 2021. For example, the fraction of black employees in senior management is slated to rise from about 61 percent to 89 percent. It would seem likely that blacks would gain at the expense of whites, but there is no way to translate those changes into absolute numbers. Adding to the complicated picture, the company plans to downsize across the board by about 20 percent. How this all would shake out racially is unclear. In May 2015, Solidarity said in a press release that in the coming year, Eskom planned to cut 1,689 blacks from its rolls, and 1,080 whites. In other words, blacks would be the bigger losers. The company distanced itself from those figures, saying they had been part of a draft plan than was never adopted. But in any event, the numbers don’t bolster the broader claim that whites will suffer more than blacks. If the numbers in the headline are dicey, so is the idea that the government had "ordered" Eskom to lay off white workers. Solidarity spokesman Redelinghuys told us that "we only said that said amount (of) white worker jobs would be reduced. The media made the article about laying off workers." Professor of labor law Christoph Garbers at Stellenbosch University told us that "the (government’s) report/ recommendation clearly does not say what the article says." Garbers said the Labor Department told Eskom to take demographics into account, but "that is a far cry from interpreting this to mean that Eskom now has to dismiss people." Garbers also said that by law and precedent "you can’t justify dismissal on the basis of affirmative action." Eskom’s spokesman told us that to date, not a single worker has been "retrenched," or as we would say in American English, laid off. Our ruling A Facebook post said that the South African government ordered a company to lay off over 3,000 white workers. The source of the figure remains unclear. While the government did tell the state utility company Eskom to increase the fraction of black workers in various job categories, it did not specify a number. And while the government could take Eskom to court if it failed to adopt a higher goal, it did not order the firm to fire anyone. On that point, even the union most closely identified with white workers agreed. Furthermore, even if that many whites did lose their jobs, the figure alone says nothing about whether more blacks might lose theirs. Eskom plans to downsize and in one plan leaked from the company, that’s exactly what could have taken place. Lastly, South African law bars a company from laying off a worker in order to meet affirmative action goals, an expert told us. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07634	Says Texas colleges and universities may opt to allow guns on campuses.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/17/eddie-rodriguez/state-rep-eddie-rodriguez-says-colleges-and-univer/	State Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, D-Austin, recently said he supports the right to carry firearms, but individual schools colleges should decide whether students can pack them rather than legislators approving a blanket law permitting concealed handguns on campuses. Appearing on CNN on Feb. 22, Rodriguez said: "Colleges and universities can have guns on campus (now), allow it to happen, and they haven’t done it. He was interviewed alongside state Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, who has authored legislation allowing concealed handguns on college campuses. Only Utah has such a law. We wondered if colleges can already to permit guns on campus. To back up Rodriguez, Nate Walker, his chief of staff, pointed us to Section 46.03 of the state penal code, which includes language in place since 1974 listing places where weapons, including firearms, cannot be taken. The law says it’s illegal to bring a firearm on "the physical premises of a school or educational institution, any grounds or building on which an activity sponsored by a school or educational institution is being conducted, or a passenger transportation vehicle of a school or educational institution, whether the school or educational institution is public or private, unless pursuant to written regulations or written authorization of the institution." According to W. Scott Lewis, Texas legislative director of Students for Concealed Carry on Campus, "a college or university could (now) choose to create an administrative policy overruling the statutory prohibition against possessing a firearm at an educational institution," he said, pointing to the same section of the penal code. Brian Malte, state legislative director for the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun regulations, also interpreted the law to mean universities and colleges can grant concealed-carry permit holders permission to bring handguns onto campus "on a case by case basis." Lewis said no Texas college has permitted guns on campus, but in 2007 the Harrold school district, northwest of Fort Worth near Oklahoma, gave employees the OK to carry concealed firearms, a development we confirmed in an August 2008 Associated Press news article. The district’s policy was the first in Texas, the Houston Chronicle reported a month later. The policy, which refers to the law highlighted by Rodriguez’s aide, states the board "may, from time to time, authorize specific school employees to possess certain firearms on school property, at school-sponsored or school-sanctioned events, and at board meetings." Only employees with an up-to-date concealed handgun license are eligible, the policy says. David Thweatt, the district’s superintendent, told us the policy has not been challenged in court. Wondering why no college has similarly allowed concealed weapons, we consulted state Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who as a state senator authored the 1995 legislation allowing Texans to carry concealed handguns. Patterson pointed to Section 46.035 in the penal code, which he speculated trumps any permission a university may grant to a concealed handgun license holder. The section says it’s illegal for a concealed handgun license holder to carry a handgun on "the premises where a high school, collegiate, or professional sporting event or interscholastic event is taking place, unless the license holder is a participant and a handgun is used in the event." "At what time does the University of Texas campus have a sporting event not going on?" Patterson said. "What is a sporting event? Is that a workout? .. I don’t think as a practical matter they could allow anyone to carry a handgun." Austin attorney Allen Halbrook, who has defended licensed firearms dealers, pointed out that "premises" is defined in the penal code as "a building or a portion of building" in the penal code. Halbrook said he thought it would generally be illegal to bring a concealed handgun into a classroom. But, Halbrook speculated, maybe not other places on campus: "For instance, if I’m a legal, 21-year-old student who’s qualified to own and possess a handgun, if the college permits it, I could have one in my dorm room," he said. Finally, we turned to state authorities for clarification. Most were mum. Spokespeople at Texas A&M University, the University of Texas System, the Higher Education Coordinating Board, the Department of Public Safety and the Texas Legislative Council, which Walker said informed Rodriguez about the law by telephone, each declined to comment. Jerry Strickland, a spokesman for the Texas attorney general’s office, reiterated the prohibition against firearms in school buildings, at sporting events and on "any grounds or building on which activity sponsored by a school or educational institution is being conducted." Yet he also noted that firearms aren’t restricted by law from school streets, sidewalks and parking areas. Strickland declined to comment on whether colleges and universities can allow concealed handgun holders to bring their guns into other areas of campus. "We have not had occasion to look at that issue thoroughly," he said. Our take: State law allows higher-ed institutions to permit weapons, though concealed handguns are prohibited from sporting and interscholastic events. We rate Rodriguez’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-13976	"We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-us-gives-100000-green-cards-y/	In a statement after an attack on an LGBT nightclub in Orlando that killed at least 50 people, Donald Trump warned that such attacks would continue as long as the United States opens its doors to Muslim immigrants. "We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year," Trump said in the June 12, 2016, statement. "Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States. Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term – and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing." In this fact-check, we’ll look at Trump’s assertion that "we admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year." (We’ll leave it to readers to decide whether that’s too many, too little, or just right.) We will start by noting that "lifetime migrants" is not a commonly used term in the immigration-policy world, and the Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. However, after checking with experts, we feel confident that Trump meant to describe people who are given permanent residency. Specifically, he was referring to the number of people each year who receive "green cards" -- the documentation for permanent residency in the United States, which enables the bearer to apply to become citizens within three to five years. The Department of Homeland Security tallies these numbers by publishing annual statistics for "persons obtaining lawful permanent resident status" by country of birth. (By and large, refugees are included in this total, though they account for just a fraction of all green-card recipients.) The trickiest part of checking Trump’s math has to do with what should be considered "the Middle East." Trump is correct if you use a somewhat expansive definition of the "Middle East." Here’s a rundown by countries and number of new green cards issued in 2014, the most recent year for which full data is available. We’ve listed them in descending order by number of green cards issued. Country New green cards in 2014 Iraq 19,153 Pakistan 18,612 Iran 11,615 Egypt 11,477 Afghanistan 10,527 Jordan 5,187 Turkey 3,834 Israel 3,805 Morocco 3,605 Syria 3,540 Yemen 3,492 Lebanon 3,245 Saudi Arabia 1,696 Algeria 1,669 Kuwait 1,057 United Arab Emirates 1,039 Libya 524 Tunisia 429 Qatar 202 Bahrain 122 Oman 90 Total 104,920 That total represents slightly under 10 percent of green card recipients from around the world, which amounted to 1,016,518 in 2014. Some may quibble with the inclusion of certain countries on this list, since they arguably lie outside a strict definition of the Middle East. These include countries that might be considered to be part of central Asia (Afghanistan and Pakistan), countries that might be considered to be in north Africa (Algeria, Libya and Tunisia), and one country that is partially in Europe (Turkey). If you subtract the green cards from each of those countries, the number falls to just under 70,000, which would make Trump’s claim somewhat exaggerated. However, experts we checked with don’t think it’s unreasonable in common conversation to include such countries as Afghanistan, Libya and Pakistan in the Middle East, particularly given how intertwined those countries have become with the United States’ Middle East policy in recent years. Given Trump’s focus on support for Islamic extremism, it’s also worth a reminder that country of origin is not the same thing as religious affiliation. "The Census Bureau does not gather data by religious affiliation, so it would not be possible to disaggregate minority-religion populations from this region, such as Coptic Christians and Chaldean Christians, that have sought and received refugee status," said Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute. And many of the immigrants from Israel -- another country included in the chart above -- are Jewish. And a final technical note: While Trump used the word "admit" in reference to migrants getting green cards, Mittelstadt noted that slightly more than half of all green cards issued annually are given to people who are already in the United States, but who have a different immigration status. So the connection between obtaining a green card and someone’s entry into the United States can be separated in time. Our ruling Trump said, "We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year." A strict definition of the region produces a number closer to 70,000. But adding in other countries that most Americans would consider to be in the Middle East, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey, brings the number to 100,000 or more. It’s also worth remembering that not all immigrants from these countries are Muslim. All in all, the statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/43e8d534-e493-4d5e-b38a-f156a7c0fc7a	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-06-13T15:31:20	2016-06-12	['Middle_East']
pomt-05376	Mitt Romney has "proposed cutting his own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/08/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-cut-his-own-taxes-while-ra/	President Barack Obama says Mitt Romney is the anti-Robin Hood. In a campaign speech in Columbus, Ohio, on May 5, 2012, Obama said the Romney's economic plan would raise taxes for millions of low-income Americans while cutting them for the wealthy. Obama told the crowd that Romney "doesn’t seem to understand" that helping the rich doesn’t automatically trickle down to benefit the poor. "Why else would he want to spend trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Why else would he propose cutting his own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families?" Obama said. Romney's tax plan, unveiled in February, includes a repeal of the estate tax, a decrease in the corporate tax rate and a 20 percent across-the-board rate cut for all personal income tax brackets. So how is it that some people’s taxes would actually increase under his plan? We decided to check it out. How Romney would pay less We contacted the Romney campaign for more details on his tax plan but did not hear back. So we're relying on the Romney campaign's description of the tax plan and the analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a well-respected independent group. Romney’s tax plan would affect what he personally pays in federal income taxes. With a fortune estimated at between $80 million and $250 million and 2010 earnings of around $21 million, Romney falls in the top tax bracket. That class currently pays a 35 percent rate. His plan would reduce that to 28 percent. "The tax plan would cut taxes on the rich a lot," said Roberton Williams, an economist with the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution think tanks that published an analysis of Romney’s plan. The 20 percent cut, Williams said, is "a huge savings for the people at the top end." How others could pay more Romney’s tax plan also allows the expiration of tax cuts enacted in the economic stimulus package, including: The American Opportunity Tax Credit raises the maximum education tax credit from $1,800 to $2,500 and it makes the credit partially refundable so low-income people who don’t pay any taxes would still benefit. The stimulus bill also increased the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working families from 40 percent to 45 percent. An extension enacted in 2010 increased the maximum credit for families with three or more children from $5,236 to $5,891 in 2011. The child credit, a tax benefit to offset the cost of raising a child, is a partially refundable credit of up to $1,000 per child. Recent legislation lowered the threshold for qualifying, so that working families with earnings above $3,000 qualify for at least a partial credit. These tax cuts provide substantial cuts for low-income taxpayers. And since Romney’s plan would allow them to expire, that’s who would see a tax increase under his proposal. (We are defining "working families" as tax filers or non-filers who receive a benefit from those tax cuts.) The Tax Policy Center said Romney’s plan would raise taxes on about 11 percent of tax filers (or those too poor to file and pay taxes) by an average of about $900 in 2015. With 165 million filers in the U.S., that’s about 18 million people, as Obama said. Said Williams: "Because he would not extend the Obama tax cuts, the people at the bottom who were benefiting from those cuts would see their taxes go up." It’s worth noting that overall, most people’s taxes would decrease under Romney’s plan. The Tax Policy Center said that 70 percent would get tax cuts averaging almost $4,300 -- a result of the 20 percent rate cut. Our ruling Obama claimed Romney’s plan would cut his own taxes while raising them on 18 million working families. The Tax Policy Center found that, indeed, even with a 20 percent rate cut, 18 million people would find themselves in a gap where the rate cut wouldn’t offset the loss of benefits from the Obama tax cuts Romney would let expire. That is, they’d end up paying more (or getting less in refunds) without the expanded child credit, EITC and education credit. Romney has not explicitly said he wants those tax cuts to end, but his lack of support for extending them means there would be an increase on the 18 million people. Obama's statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-05-08T16:54:03	2012-05-05	['None']
pomt-02711	"This is the first time in Texas history -- and only the fourth time in United States history -- that two women are running for the top spots."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/dec/26/gilberto-hinojosa/two-women-running-top-state-offices-isnt-unusual-t/	The chairman of the Texas Democratic Party declared in a December email blast soliciting contributions that the Texas party is making history. "This is the first time in Texas history -- and only the fourth time in United States history -- that two women are running for the top spots," Gilberto Hinojosa said. He was referring to the Democratic state senators who have filed to run in 2014 for governor (Wendy Davis of Fort Worth) and lieutenant governor (Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio). Is this the first time that Democratic women have sought these offices in the same year? No, we quickly found. In 2010, San Antonio physician Alma Ludivina Aguado unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor, losing in the party primary, and Linda Chavez-Thompson was the party's pick for lieutenant governor. But what about women seeking the top office in a general election? Since Davis has a little-known opponent in the March 2014 primary, Reynaldo "Ray" Madrigal, and Van de Putte is unopposed, it's likely that both Davis and Van de Putte will both be nominated and appear back to back, so to speak, on the November 2014 general-election ballot. A party spokesman, Emmanuel Garcia, said by phone that this is what Hinojosa was underscoring. A party spokeswoman, Ada Ortega, told us that Hinojosa’s first/fourth declaration was rooted in a Nov. 23, 2013, Associated Press news article on Van de Putte declaring her candidacy for lieutenant governor. The AP story hinted at the expectation that Democrats will nominate Davis and Van de Putte, stating: "It is the first time in Texas history women have led a major party's ticket for the state's top offices, and only the fourth time in U.S. history." By email, the reporter who wrote the story, Austin-based Will Weissert, told us he drew that conclusion based on a July 26, 2013, press release from the New Jersey-based Center for American Women and Politics. That release said that just twice before, in Illinois in 1994 and Kentucky in 1999, major-party tickets were led by two women. At the time of the release, the third instance was about to be New Jersey state Sen. Barbara Buono running for governor with union executive Milly Silva as her lieutenant governor running mate, the release said. (The pair lost in a November 2013 landslide to Republican Gov. Chris Christie and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno.) In 1994, the center said, Illinois Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dawn Clark Netsch chose state Sen. Penny Severns as her running mate. In 1999, Kentucky Republican gubernatorial candidate Peppy Martin ran with a Taylor County school board member. Both tickets lost. By telephone, the center’s director, Debbie Walsh, stressed that in the three previous instances, the nominees ran together as a ticket. Texas doesn't do it that way; the Texas governor and lieutenant governor each stand election on their own. Walsh, who said the center has collected information on women running for office since its 1971 launch, said the center did not look into how often, if at all, two women simultaneously sought to be nominated in a primary for a state’s top two offices. At our request, the center searched for such instances since 2000, which Walsh said was the earliest year for which information across the states was easily accessed. Walsh then emailed us a chart indicating that two women or more have run in primaries for governor and lieutenant governor in Alabama, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas (as noted above) and Wisconsin. All told, Walsh said, if Davis and Van de Putte win their respective nominations, the two will be the nation’s fourth all-female top-of-the-ticket in November. By phone, party spokesman Garcia said Hinojosa could have clarified that he was referring to the historic significance of Davis and Van de Putte as November nominees. After we published this article, the Associated Press noted in a Jan. 1, 2014, news article that in Arizona in 1998, women captured the five top state offices. According to Arizona’s Nov. 23, 1998, canvass of that voting, the victors were: Republicans Jane Dee Hull, governor, and Betsey Bayless, secretary of state; Democrat Janet Napolitano, attorney general; and Republicans Carol Springer, state treasurer, and Lisa Graham Keegan, superintendent of public instruction. Then again, Arizona has no lieutenant governor. Voters in 2010 rejected a proposal to create the office. Our ruling Hinojosa said: "This is the first time in Texas history -- and only the fourth time in United States history -- that two women are running for the top spots." Hinojosa is entirely correct in reference to general elections nationally only if the 1998 victories of two Arizona Republicans are not considered. But two or more women have sought to be nominated for a state’s top elected positions more than 20 times since 2000. We rate this partly accurate claim as Half True. UPDATE, 4:30 p.m., Jan. 3, 2014: We updated this article to note that in 1998, women ran and won the top state offices in Arizona. This change did not affect our initial rating.

pomt-00715	Austin has "gone from being the 24th most congested city just about 10 years ago to being the fourth most congested — more congested than NYC."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/apr/28/steve-adler/steve-adler-says-austins-4th-most-congested-us-cit/	Traffic in Austin is so awful, Mayor Steve Adler declared, there’s less congestion in the Big Apple. Adler, speaking to the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, said April 1, 2015: "We have gone from being the 24th most congested city just about 10 years ago to being the fourth most congested — more congested than NYC," Adler said, according to his prepared remarks emailed later to an Austin American-Statesman editor. Is all of that so? Austin’s congestion may have gotten even worse, we learned, though hizzoner’s New York angle overlooks that drivers bent on reaching the boroughs have longer commutes. To our inquiry, mayoral aide Jim Wick said Adler relied on traffic scorecards for different years put out by Inrix, a company that says it analyzes real-time traffic conditions as part of its focus on "understanding the science of traffic." In the latest Inrix scorecard, Wick noted by email, Austin landed fourth in traffic congestion, New York fifth. We confirmed those rankings as cited. But a March 2014 Inrix summary of its latest report, based on traffic conditions in 2013, suggests Austin motorists wasted fewer hours stuck in traffic on average that year (41 hours) than drivers in New York, who averaged 53 wasted hours. Cities with more hours wasted in traffic were Los Angeles (No. 1), Honolulu and San Francisco, Inrix said. Inrix’s illustration of the Austin-New York results: SOURCE: Blog post, "Three Takeaways from INRIX’s 7th Annual Traffic Scorecard," Inrix website, March 2014 (accessed April 8, 2015) Still, Austin ranked No. 1 nationally in traffic complaints made on Twitter, besting Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Seattle, according to the summary. And did Austin rank 24th in congestion a decade past? Wick emailed us a February 2009 Inrix scorecard, based on traffic conditions in 2008, placing Austin-Round Rock 21st nationally that year and 26th in 2007. (This is a good time to stress that each city analyzed by Inrix is the city’s metropolitan area, sweeping in nearby communities.) Wick said the mayor's prepared remarks may have had a typo; they should have said 24th. Inrix: Austin congestion ‘getting worse’ Next, we turned to Inrix to ask why Austin edged New York in the latest congestion rankings even though New York drivers piled up more hours stuck behind trucks. Inrix spokesman Jim Bak reaffirmed that New York drivers spent more time on average stuck in traffic in 2013, but Austin ranked worse in "congestion intensity" according to the Inrix index basically showing how bad traffic gets at peak drive times, Inrix says. For a road segment with no congestion, for instance, the index score is zero. Each additional point in the index represents a percentage point increase in the average travel time of a commute during peak travel hours compared to free-flow conditions. Peak times are defined as the weekday hours from 6 a.m to 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. For 2013, Inrix says, Austin had a higher index than New York. In fact, more up-to-date Inrix data indicates that in the 12 months through July 2014, Austin still ranked fourth nationally with an Inrix index score of 23.3; New York, by then placing sixth nationally, had a score of 20.7. What this means: Austin drivers accustomed to a 20-minute free-flow trip were taking nearly 25 minutes to make the same trip at peak times--reflecting a 23 percent increase of four minutes and forty seconds over free-flow conditions. The traffic delay exceeded the comparable pause for New York drivers by 32 seconds, per Inrix. By Inrix’s research, Bak indicated, Inrix’s report covering conditions in 2008 placed Austin’s index 21st nationally compared to 26th in 2007, he said. In 2008, cities that had worse traffic than Austin according to the Inrix index included Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington, D.C., Houston, Boston, Seattle, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Phoenix, Miami, San Diego, Denver, Baltimore, San Jose and Detroit. Drumming the Truth-O-Meter, we asked Bak to unpack the New York contrast. Can it really be Austin has worse congestion? After all, you rarely see a New York movie without cars piled bumper to bumper. Bak conceded New York drivers, on average, face longer commutes. But focusing solely on drive times to judge congestion, Bak said, would lead to results driven by population. We looked for alternate congestion analyses. Census Bureau survey By email, Alan Pisarski, a Virginia transportation expert, responded to our inquiry by suggesting we consider the latest federal survey indicating how long it takes Americans to get to work. The U.S. Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey asked respondents to say how many minutes it usually took to get from their home to work the previous week. Austin residents reported average travel times of 23.5 minutes, placing the city behind more than 300 others with 65,000 residents or more, according to a chart emailed to us by a bureau spokesman. Cities with longer reported travel times included Pittsburgh and New York, with 40-minute averages; Chicago, 34 minutes; Philadelphia and San Francisco, 32 minutes each; Baltimore, 31 minutes; Los Angeles and Boston, 30 minutes each; Detroit, 27 minutes; Houston, 26; Las Vegas, 25--and many more. Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein also emailed a chart showing the survey results by metropolitan region. By that filter, drivers from the New York-Jersey City-White Plains, N.Y. area reported travel times of nearly 37 minutes, the second-longest nationally. Drivers from the Austin-Round Rock area had travel times of 26 minutes, ranking behind more than 90 areas. Texas A&M Transportation Institute We also reached out to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, which has long gauged traffic conditions. Its 2012 "Urban Mobility Report" includes a chart indicating that in 2011 (the latest year checked), New York ranked fourth nationally with 59 hours in average travel delays per auto commuter while Austin tied for 17th with Portland, Oregon and Las Vegas with 44 hours in average travel delays per auto commuter. Another entry in the chart, though, states drivers in peak periods in New York and Austin were experiencing nearly identical percentage increases in travel times, on average. By phone, the institute’s Tim Lomax pointed out its research compares metropolitan regions, not cities in themselves. So its New York data takes into account portions of New Jersey and Connecticut and its Austin figures sweep in parts of nearby Hays and Williamson counties. Unlike Inrix, Lomax said, the institute "weights" its results so congestion on heavily travelled roads factors more significantly into results. Heads up: The institute is teaming with Inrix to produce a report covering 2014 traffic conditions, Bak and Lomax each said. And, Bak said, Austin looks to rank fourth again nationally for congestion with an index score of 24.9, up 7 percent. Congestion, Bak said, "is getting worse," largely due to the improving economy. Given the A&M institute’s 2011 statistics showed drivers in Austin and New York facing nearly identical percentage increases in drive time but the actual minutes added in travel time were higher in New York, we asked Lomax if the data show Austin is more congested than New York. "I don’t think they do," Lomax said, adding: "By one measure, they have about the same traffic congestion. By another measure, New York is worse than Austin." Still, he added, "by no measure does Austin have a great traffic situation." A decade ago We also peeked at charts showing how the institute’s travel time indexes and peak delay times for Austin and New York changed annually from 2006 through 2011. Austin's index ranged from 1.30 to 1.33, often placing the city fourth nationally. New York’s index, ranging from 1.32 to 1.42, ranked No. 1 two years, No. 3 other years. Austin’s average delay per peak-auto-commuter (a mouthful meaning the yearly sum of all the per-trip delays for drivers traveling in peak periods) ranged from a high of 56 hours in 2006 to a low of 43 hours in 2010 with its national rank ranging from 8th to 18th. New York’s comparables were a low of 54 hours of delay in 2006 to a high of 66 hours in 2007, landing the city third to ninth over the years. TomTom Lomax pointed us to another outfit that analyzes urban congestion--TomTom, maker of navigational devices. A chart posted online by TomTom in 2015 shows "congestion levels" for cities which it says is the increase in overall travel times at peak hours compared to travel times in free-flow conditions. Sound familiar? In 2014, according to GPS measurements from TomTom's traffic database, New York ranked fourth among the nation’s cities with a congestion level of 31 percent; Austin ranked 13th with a congestion level of 25 percent (the same as the levels in Houston and Tampa). Then again, TomTom also presents congestion as similar in New York and Austin in that an Austin driver with a 30-minute drive (counting trips to and from work) piled up 21 minutes a day in traffic delays--just like a New York counterpart doing a 30-minute commute. Nick Cohn, a TomTom traffic expert, called us back from New York and showed us how to check travel time added in morning versus evening peak times for each city. According to TomTom, New York drivers in 2014 faced slightly longer percentage delays weekday mornings--on average, seeing a 48 percent longer trip than in free-flow conditions compared to a Austinites’ 42 percent longer trip. But Austin drivers got delayed incrementally more in evening rush hour--experiencing an average 61 percent bump in travel time compared to free-flow conditions versus New York’s 56 percent surge. But around the clock and through each week, Cohn said, New York has worse congestion than Austin because its roadways are crowded more often. Taken as a whole, Cohn said, New York has more wasted travel time. "Your chances of hitting a traffic jam outside peak periods is higher in New York than in Austin," he said. Our ruling Adler said of Austin: "We have gone from being the 24th most congested city just about 10 years ago to being the 4th most congested. More congested than NYC." Inrix ranked Austin the nation’s No. 4 worst for congestion through 2013, just ahead of the No. 5 New York area. Also, Austin placed 26th for congestion in 2007, not quite a decade ago. But there's missing context here in that by various measures, New York’s congestion comes out worse than what Austin drivers have been experiencing. On balance, we rate this statement Half True.

Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were reviled by some conservative segments of the electorate by the time he left office in 2001. And Gallup Organization polling has showed that the percentage of people with a negative opinion of Hillary Clinton has scored in the 40s — or higher — consistently since 2000. Dodd isn't the first to question whether Clinton could win a national election, or to note how polarizing she is. Among others: • "The fact that Senator Clinton is a polarizing figure in American politics is not even a point of debate,'' said David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser to Barack Obama. "It's an empirical fact.'' • Republican strategist Karl Rove called Clinton "fatally flawed" because of her high negatives. In the matter of Dodd's quote, a Zogby International survey released in October 2007 reported 50 percent of voters would refuse to vote for her. A Harris Poll in March 2007 had the same result. However, that statistic alone doesn't tell the whole story of whether or not Clinton could win in the general election. Clinton generates strong ill-will among Republicans but she also draws raves by Democrats. A Gallup Poll released Dec. 19, 2007, shows Clinton has advantages against leading Republican candidates Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney in hypothetical matchups. She led most Republicans narrowly in Rasmussen Reports polling in December 2007, and in some cases better than other leading Democrats. "While she may be polarizing, she is definitely electable. If Sen. Clinton is the Democratic nominee, she has a very strong base of support and very strong opposition," said pollster Scott Rasmussen, president of Rasmussen Reports. The Gallup Poll also found that Clinton would not have to look far to find a polarizing candidate who took the White House. Her husband, Bill, won in 1992 when his negatives outstripped his positives in spring polling. George W. Bush won re-election in 2004 with high unfavorability ratings, although the Gallup Poll had higher positive ratings for him than negative ratings early in 2004. In 2007, Clinton's favorability went from 48 percent in August to 51 percent in December, noted Jeffrey Jones, managing editor of the Gallup Poll. "I would say with her favorability ratings now she could be electable," Jones said. "It would definitely be to her advantage if the Republican Party would nominate a candidate with high unfavorability." So Dodd is accurate when he cites polls that show 50 percent of the American public won't vote for Clinton. But the rest of the story is that it's not a dealbreaker as far as electibility goes.

pomt-05671	Says David Rivera "allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act" that would crack down on insider trading by members of Congress.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/mar/16/luis-garcia/house-republicans-stock-act-key-provisions-rivera/	Members of Congress are generally wealthier than the people they represent, and some leave office with fatter bank accounts than when they started. Could their growing riches be a result of access to special information that allowed them to make lucrative trades in the stock market? Those were questions that 60 Minutes tackled in a November 2011 report inspire by the book Throw Them All Out, by Peter Schweizer, a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University. The book’s thesis is that members of Congress are using inside information to buy and sell stocks at a profit, using advantages that ordinary investors don’t have. The 60 Minutes report helped breathe life into a bill largely ignored by Congress for years, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act. Suddenly, nearly everyone in Congress was in support of banning themselves from insider trading. The Senate and House passed different versions in February. Bipartisanship at its best? Hardly. Democrats argue that the legislation passed by the Republican-controlled House is too watered down. That argument has reverberated down to a Florida congressional race. Luis Garcia, a Miami Beach state representative and a Democrat, is trying to unseat U.S. Rep. David Rivera, R-Miami. In a Feb. 15, 2012, press release, Garcia attacked Rivera’s vote on the STOCK Act to suggest that Rivera is soft on public corruption. Garcia said Rivera "allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act that would crack down on corruption of public officials and on those who peddle political inside information for profit." We should note that Garcia’s claim was similar to claims in a press release sent by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee just a few days earlier. Rivera is the subject of a criminal probe by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service related to $510,000 in undisclosed payments from a gambling enterprise to a company owned by his mother. Here, we will fact-check Garcia’s claim that Rivera allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act about public corruption and on those who peddle insider information. In a related report, we will check another claim from Garcia, that Rivera received a $5,000 contribution from U.S. Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., who is under a House ethics investigation related to his stock trades. Roots of the STOCK Act Insider trading is illegal for everyone, including members of Congress -- even without the STOCK Act. But independent investigations by journalists and academics show suspicious patterns of trading by members of Congress. Fueled in particular by the 60 Minutes report, members wanted to pass legislation specifically for Congress, so there is no uncertainty about the matter. While newspaper articles have often focused on the trades of individual politicians, some believe the problem could be more widespread. Alan Ziobrowski, a business professor at Georgia State University, found that senators’ purchases outperformed the overall market, according to his 2004 paper on the topic. His research showed "senators trade with a substantial informational advantage....The results suggest that senators knew when to buy their common stocks and when to sell," he wrote. In testimony about the STOCK Act in December, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement director Robert Khuzami said that under current law pursuing insider-trading charges against a member of Congress, "is without direct precedent and may present some unique issues." (Here’s more analysis about the complications of a federal agency investigating Congress.) In 2006, a version of the STOCK Act was introduced after the Wall Street Journal reported that Tony Rudy, chief of staff to then House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, engaged in hundreds of stock trades from his computer at the Capitol. The bill never received a vote. It was reintroduced in 2007 and 2009 but drew little interest. Before the 60 Minutes report aired on Nov. 19, 2011, the STOCK Act had nine co-sponsors. After it aired, it got than 200 within a few weeks. Rivera signed on in December. Fighting over the STOCK Act It’s at this point, when it looked like the STOCK Act might have an actual chance of passing, that the real battle began. On Feb. 2, 2012, the Senate approved an amendment calling for the "public corruption prosecution improvements" that was intended to give prosecutors more tools to go after corrupt public officials, including stiffer sentences. The Senate version also included new requirements for "political intelligence consultants," people who monitor actions on the Hill and sell the information to investors. The concern was that the consultants receive nonpublic information from members of Congress, so the Senate required them to disclose their activities the way that lobbyists do. The Senate approved the bill 96-3. Over in the House, Republican majority leader Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., unveiled his own version, which stripped out the public corruption amendment and the requirement that political intelligence consultants disclose their activities. Democrats and watchdog groups criticized Cantor’s bill as weak -- but so did a Republican senator who zeroed in on the elimination of the political consultant provision. "It’s astonishing and extremely disappointing that the House would fulfill Wall Street’s wishes by killing this provision," said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, in a statement. "If Congress delays action, the political intelligence industry will stay in the shadows, just the way Wall Street likes it." Still, House Republicans added new clauses to the bill and said they were strengthening it. They called one of those sections the "Pelosi provision"; it included stricter rules for members participating in public offerings. The 60 Minutes investigation reported that U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., participated in Visa’s initial public offering while a bill about credit cards was pending. Several groups that advocate for government transparency have called for a stronger version of the law including the Sunlight Foundation (which called the House version "STOCK Act Lite") and Common Cause. The House approved their version on Feb. 9 in a vote of 417-2. News reports in early March indicated that the Senate might accept the House’s version of the bill. Whatever one thinks of the particulars of the House version, its passage might still serve as a warning for Congress about insider trading, said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice who prosecuted securities fraud. "The real effect of the STOCK Act is to put on notice prominently everyone on Capitol Hill and in the federal government that using material non-public information to buy or sell securities, or to tip off another person to do so, is a violation of federal law, and that they have a duty to keep confidential such information," said Frenkel in an email. Rivera’s role We asked Garcia directly what he meant by saying Rivera "allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act." What did Rivera do specifically that allowed the House version of this legislation to go forward? By his "yes" vote, Rivera allowed it, Garcia said. "He voted for the law," Garcia said. "If you are voting for that law you are allowing that law to go on." We checked to see if Rivera took any public action to encourage a stronger STOCK Act. We searched news reports and Rivera’s office website and could not find anything beyond a single "week in review" press release. Garcia’s statement -- that Rivera "allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act" -- makes it sounds like Rivera had some sort of power to stop Republican leaders from recrafting the bill, perhaps thanks to a committee post or close ties to leadership. In fact, that’s not the case. Rivera doesn’t have any powerful committee role connected to the act and is a member of separate House committees on foreign affairs and natural resources. Meanwhile, Cantor has kept his distance from Rivera at times. In 2011, a Cantor spokesman said Cantor had concerns about investigations into Rivera. When Cantor held a fundraiser in Miami in February 2011, Rivera wasn’t in attendance. Our ruling Garcia claimed that "Congressman David Rivera allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act that would crack down on corruption of public officials and on those who peddle political inside information for profit." It’s true that Rivera voted for a version of the bill that removed provisions related to corruption of public officials and on political intelligence consultants. But Garcia doesn’t offer any evidence that Rivera "allowed" it to happen other than voting for it. The statement makes it sound like Rivera had some sort of powerful role in making the legislation coming to pass. Actually, Rivera himself is under investigation -- and not exactly the guy House leaders would turn to when crafting legislation about ethics. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10104	Barack Obama will "raise Social Security taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/23/republican-party-florida/extra-taxes-possible-for-high-earners/	A campaign mailer from the Republican Party of Florida attacked Barack Obama on the issue of the economy. We received the mailer on Oct. 22, 2008. "How do Barack Obama's plans impact your budget?" reads the mailer. "Will you count on Social Securty? Obama plan: Raise Social Security taxes." Obama has floated proposals to raise Social Security taxes, but only on those who have incomes of about $250,000 a year and above. To be clear, when we talk about Social Security taxes, we're talking about payroll taxes paid by workers who have not yet retired ( not taxes on the benefits of retirees). Most workers currently pay 6.2 percent of their earnings in Social Security taxes, on earnings up to a limit of about $102,000 in 2008. If you want to look at your own pay stub, the line that represents Social Security taxes is usually labeled FICA OASDI, which stands for Federal Insurance Contributions Act Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance. Now you know. The Social Security system is expected to need more money after the baby boomers retire. One of Obama's proposals to address problems with the program is to begin taxing benefits on higher incomes that are now exempt. He proposes to start taxing income of $250,000 and higher at a rate somewhere between 2 and 4 percent, and this includes an employer contribution, so the cost to the worker would likely be between 1 and 2 percent. By the way, people who make $250,000 or more make up roughly 3 percent of everyone who files taxes. So Obama does propose raising Social Security taxes. But the raise would hit only a small portion of the population. We find the Republican Party of Florida's statement to be overly broad and rate it Half True.

pomt-12967	"While many urban areas across the country saw a sharp increase in crime over the last year, the Philadelphia Police Department successfully lowered part one crimes."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/dec/27/jim-kenney/did-major-crimes-drop-philly-compared-other-cities/	Mayor Jim Kenney’s administration recently released a report stuffed with the good news that happened during his first year in office. It notes how the DNC was better for local businesses than the pope and contains plenty about the soda tax and the upcoming education initiatives it will fund. But the report first discusses crime, consistently one of the biggest concerns for Philadelphians who flirt with leaving the city. "While many urban areas across the country saw a sharp increase in crime over the last year," the report reads, "the Philadelphia Police Department successfully lowered part one crimes and increased drug seizures." So what’s part one crime, and did Philly’s part one crime rate drop? And did other cities have difficulty keeping their overall crimes rates low? We decided to check. And for fun we’ll look into how this year’s change in the crime rate compares to the years of former Mayor Michael Nutter. First, Philly’s crime rate. Part one crimes are defined by the Uniform Crime Reporting Act as forcible rape, homicide, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson. The mayor’s report states that of part one crimes as of Dec. 11, homicide is down 1 percent, burglaries are down 14 percent, reports of rape down 10 percent and robberies down 8 percent. The administration said it obtained its data from the Uniform Crime Reporting Act. If you look at year-to-date statistics directly from the police department on Dec. 11, they’re slightly different. Homicide, for instance, was up 2 percent. But either way, part one crime was down 1 percent on Dec. 11 and violent part one crime was down about 5 percent, according to statistics from the police. The decrease follows a years-long trend for Philadelphia. Under the Nutter administration, violent crime decreased about 20 percent from when he took office in 2008 to the end of 2015. Most of the decrease took place in his last four years, but Philly experienced a slight decrease in violent crime in his first year before slight increases the next three years. Not every city can tell the same story as Philadelphia about a reduction in crime and violent crime this year. Throughout 2016, national publications have hyped a rise in violent crime, particularly murder rates, for reasons unclear to experts. Among big cities that have experienced a surge in violent crime are Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles. As of last week, Dallas’ part one crime rate had increased .1 percent and Los Angeles’ 5.4 percent. Nearby big cities like New York and Baltimore have seen a decrease in part one crime, like Philadelphia, according to statistics from their police departments. A recent study by the Brennan Center looked at 21 of the 30 largest U.S. cities and compared projections of crime rates from 2016 to 2015, based on numbers it collected in September. It found the projected crime rate up 1.3 percent overall, a projection the Brennan Center described as "nearly unchanged," the violent crime rate up 5.5 percent and the murder rate up 13.1 percent. The Brennan Center notes most of the fluctuations in the crime rate fall within expected ranges and there has been no national wave of crime. The main reasons for stories about an unclear increase in murder and violent crime nationally are outliers like Chicago and San Antonio, which have seen their murder rates go up about 47 percent and 50 percent, respectively, this year. For overall crime rate, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Antonio, Charlotte and Oklahoma City were the only cities with increases in crime above 4 percent. Philadelphia is one of 13 of the 21 cities to experience a reduction in total crime and one of eight to see a reduction in violent crime.

pomt-07364	Says people in Africa "literally walk two and three hundred miles" in order to vote.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2011/may/06/mike-bennett/think-we-have-it-tough-africa-people-walk-300-mile/	Republicans and Democrats in the Florida Senate argued on May 5, 2011, over the purpose of a major elections overhaul, with Democrats saying the bill will suppress votes and Republicans countering that it will help prevent fraud. HB 1355, which passed both chambers and now heads to the desk of Gov. Rick Scott, eliminates a four-decade-old provision that allows voters who have moved or changed their last name to update their information at the polls on Election Day. Those voters would have to file provisional ballots that are reviewed after the election. The bill also requires third-party groups like the League of Women Voters to register with the state and to turn in signed voter registration forms within 48 hours instead of the current 10 days. Democrats argued the changes make voting harder. Sen. Mike Bennett, R-Bradenton, said that's okay. Florida has made voting too easy, he said during debate, and people should be required to make an effort to cast a ballot. "We all want everybody to vote," he said. "But we want an informed voter." Voting is a privilege, Bennett said, so how easy should it be? "Do you read the stories about the people in Africa? The people in the desert, who literally walk two and three hundred miles so they can have the opportunity to do what we do, and we want to make it more convenient? How much more convenient do you want to make it? Do we want to go to their house? Take the polling booth with us? "This is a hard-fought privilege. This is something people die for. You want to make it convenient? The guy who died to give you that right, it was not convenient. Why would we make it any easier? I want 'em to fight for it. I want 'em to know what it's like. I want them to go down there, and have to walk across town to go over and vote." Do people in Africa really walk 200 to 300 miles to vote? To put that in perspective, we're talking about walking the distance between Tallahassee and Biloxi, Miss., on Interstate 10, or the distance from Miami to Daytona Beach along I-95. We didn't have to go too far to find an answer. A group of African elections experts and officials happened to be in Gainesville May 1-10 learning about the American elections process. We were able to get them on the phone with the help of University of Florida political science professor Daniel A. Smith. Through a Department of State translator, we asked each of them if people walk 200 to 300 miles in order to vote in Africa. We didn't have to wait for the translation...we heard the laughter. "A maximum of two kilometers," said Mr. Alpha Faye, a teacher of history and geology in Senegal and an elections observer. (Two kilometers is about 1.25 miles). Ms. Khadijetou Sall, a Mauritanian social worker and elections monitor, said that just like the United States, her country uses public facilities as polling places -- schools, medical clinics, other facilities in local villages. Ms. Mehla Ahmed Talebna, also of Mauritania, said that major parties also provide transportation for voters to make it to the polls, a practice also common in the United States. "No question, no one walks through the desert to vote," Talebna said. In Chad, a landlocked country with huge deserts in the north, the maximum distance you might have to walk is 5 kilometers (about 3.1 miles), added Mr. Baidessou Soukolgue, a program officer at the Chad office of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy. In Niger, it's up to 4 to 5 kilometers to a polling place or about 3 miles, said Mr. Abdoulaye Issoufou. "It is more difficult to vote here than in Niger," Issoufou said. Elections officials even have plans for the country's nomads -- who move with their cattle to find water and land for grazing. None of the African elections officials we spoke with heard of any case of someone walking 200 to 300 miles to vote. In fact, they wanted to know where Bennett got his information from. We would, too. We searched news accounts of the recent elections in Chad, Uganda, Nigeria and elsewhere and found no instance of people walking hundreds of miles in order to vote.

pomt-09428	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's "concession speech came with less than 20 percent of the precincts having been counted.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/15/linda-curtis/independent-activist-linda-curtis-says-sen-kay-bai/	Linda Curtis of Bastrop, who’s opposed Republican Gov. Rick Perry for two election seasons, says she saw a sign of GOP bigwigs running scared the night Perry bested U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and upstart Debra Medina for their party’s 2010 gubernatorial nomination. Curtis helms Independent Texans, a group that has a Web site where visitors can “blow up” Perry’s head. In a March 3 Web post headlined “Where Do Indies Go Now That Rick Perry’s Party is Over,” Curtis writes: “Kay’s concession speech came with less than 20 percent of the precincts having been counted.” Curtis saw meaning in the timing of Hutchison’s speech, which was televised statewide from her campaign party in Dallas. “It was clear that regular Republicans, out of weakness in the face of the Medina insurgency, needed to circle the wagons,” Curtis writes. “It was a very fractious (primary campaign) fight. They were risking bedlam breaking out if they didn’t patch things up quickly.” We wondered if Curtis accurately characterized the timing of the concession and if Hutchison and Perry were in cahoots to kiss and make up. Perry's challengers combined for 49 percent of nearly 1.5 million votes cast. Hutchison got 30.3 percent and Medina won 18.6 percent, according to the Texas Secretary of State’s office. Perry drew 51 percent. Curtis told us she suspects the Hutchison and Perry camps had been in touch before the results were known and knew they needed to showcase unity as soon as possible. “This is what I would do if I was just trying to maintain the status quo,” Curtis said. “It’s not a conspiracy; it’s what they do, kind of a natural move.” First, did Curtis get her numbers right? She was close. Hutchison conceded about 9:30 p.m. March 2. At 9:18 p.m., the AP had posted results from the primary based on 1,868 of 8,236 precincts, or nearly 23 percent, reporting. It's not unheard of for candidates to give in before most votes are counted. In November 2006, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Chris Bell conceded before the night was through. However, Bell spoke after the AP had declared Perry the winner, shortly before 9 p.m. This year, the Associated Press declared Perry the victor of the GOP gubernatorial primary at 10:56 p.m., about 90 minutes after Hutchison conceded. Second, was Hutchison's timing part of a joint Hutchison-Perry "unity" strategy? Mark Miner, spokesman for Perry's campaign, said there was no coordination between the campaigns on primary night. "That's just ridiculous," Miner said of Curtis's Web post. "I'm sure she wrote it from a black helicopter." Hutchison's campaign chairman, Jim Francis of Dallas, likewise disputed Curtis’s take on collaboration between the camps. “To drag it out past 10 o’clock at night was sort of an unfair thing to do to Perry," Francis said. "It was clear what the situation was. Kay wanted to exit in a classy, dignified way. That’s what she decided. There wasn’t any strategy about it.” Besides, even if she'd squeaked into a runoff, Francis said, Hutchison had already decided to concede if she trailed Perry by 20 percentage points or so -- and she did. So how does Curtis rate on the Truth-O-Meter? Hutchison conceded after about 23 percent of precincts had reported -- not less than 20 percent as Curtis said, but close. Neither the Hutchison nor Perry campaign confirmed Curtis's hunch that they strategized to hurry the senator's concession--and there's no independent way to prove or disprove her speculation. Regardless, it isn't part of her statement. We rate Curtis's statement as Mostly True.	None	Linda Curtis	None	None	None	2010-03-15T06:14:16	2010-03-04	['Kay_Bailey_Hutchison']
pomt-03399	Says Terry McAuliffe "opposes" Virginia’s right-to-work law.	false	/virginia/statements/2013/jul/03/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-opposes-virginias-right-/	GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli is painting Democratic rival Terry McAuliffe as a pawn of labor unions. During a June 21 radio interview on WWRC 1260-AM, Cuccinelli dubbed his opponent "Union Terry" and said McAuliffe’s pro-labor stance goes beyond the bounds of most Democratic lawmakers in Virginia. "He’s not even in the same place as most of his Democrats in the General Assembly," Cuccinelli said. "I mean, over three-fourths of them have supported the right-to-work, while he opposes it." Few things are as sacred in Virginia politics as the right-to-work law, which bars compulsory union membership to hold a job. Virginia is among 24 right-to-work states and supporters have long argued the law spurs economic development and affirms personal freedom. It’s become a rite that successful statewide candidates in the Old Dominion -- Democrats and Republicans -- bow at the law’s altar. McAuliffe expressed his fealty during a Jan. 21 speech before the National Federation of Independent Business. "We are a great right-to-work state," he said. "We should never change that. It helps us do what we need to do to grow our businesses here in Virginia." So we asked Cuccinelli’s campaign for proof that McAuliffe "opposes" the right-to-work law and received a three-page response from spokeswoman Anna Nix. Much of the response centered on a June 18 article in The Washington Post that said McAuliffe, during a visit to Northern Virginia, "declined to say whether he would protect the commonwealth’s status as a right to work state or search for ways to make the state more friendly toward organized labor." McAuliffe’s quoted response in the article, however, says nothing negative about right-to-work. "I’m going to work with management. I’m going to work with labor. I’m going to work with everybody to move Virginia forward," McAuliffe said. "It’s not ‘either-or.’ We are a right-to-work state that has been here for many years, and it’s not going to change. But the focus has got to be not on trying to divide folks. [It] is, how do we work together to grow the Virginia economy to have the most diverse economy to bring in those 21st-century jobs?" At a June 20 news conference in Northern Virginia, McAuliffe was again asked whether he would try to "soften or weaken" the law. He replied, "Right-to-work has been the law here in Virginia for 65 years and I wouldn’t change it." Other backup sent by Cuccinelli’s campaign equated McAuliffe’s friendliness with unions as proof that he opposes the right-to-work law. But that’s a flawed argument. "Just because he says, 'I don’t have a problem with union people,' doesn’t mean he wants to do away with the right-to-work law," said James Meath, board chairman of Williams Mullen, a Richmond-based law firm. (Meath represents the Richmond Times-Dispatch in labor matters). Cuccinelli's camp, for example, pointed us to a blog posted by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers in spring 2010 discussing McAuliffe’s plans, which he later dropped, to open an electric car manufacturing plant in Virginia. "We’re going to have 2,000 folks down there -- all of them union members," McAuliffe said of his employment plan. Meath said it’s legal for McAuliffe or anyone starting a Virginia business to contact a union and say, "Send me all your people; I’ll hire them." The right-to-work law merely states that the employer could not insist those workers remain in the union after they were hired, Meath said. Cuccinelli, in laying his charge against McAuliffe during the radio interview, also noted that his opponent has supported collective bargaining for public workers and has received and has received "hundreds of thousands of dollars" in campaign donations from organized labor. These issues, however, do not compromise the right-to-work law. Our ruling Cuccinelli said McAuliffe "opposes" the right-to-work law. He focuses on a June 18 news report that McAuliffe, during an interview, refused to defend right-to-work. But McAuliffe, in that article, did not criticize the popular law and was quoted as saying that right-to-work is "not going to change." On at least two occasions prior to Cuccinelli’s attack, McAuliffe stated that he would not try to alter the law, which he said "helps grow our businesses here in Virginia." Cuccinelli also makes a guilt-by-association argument, offering McAuliffe’s friendliness with unions as proof that he opposes right-to-work. But this, too, is a flimsy argument: It is entirely possible to support unions and the right-to-work law. Cuccinelli fails to provide credible proof of his claim and we rate it False.

pomt-06871	"Believe it or not, consumer spending is up over the last eight months."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/01/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-consumer-spending-has-actally/	As a member of House of Representatives, Ohio Gov. John Kasich chaired a budget finance committee in the 1990s when Congress achieved a bi-partisan deal to balance the federal budget under former Democratic President Bill Clinton. So, the Republican governor has become somewhat of a go-to historian lately for national media outlets reporting on the budget debate and stalemate over the debt ceiling. The governor appeared July 17, 2011, on "Meet the Press" as part of a panel discussion that also included National Urban League president Marc Morial, economist Diane Swonk, Honeywell CEO David Cote and CNBC’s David Faber. Host David Gregory set up part of the discussion with a Wall Street Journal article which rattled off a number of dejecting economic statistics and said that consumer spending has been decimated. Faber concurred, saying that the United States has a consumer-led economy and consumers just aren’t willing to spend right now. Cote noted that businesses like his are reluctant to increase production which could in turn create more jobs until they are sure there is demand for their products from consumers. Then Kasich chimed in. "Believe it or not, consumer spending is up over the last eight months, OK?" he said. Swonk, the economist, acknowledged Kasich’s point. The governor then went on to suggest that business has been slow to grow and add jobs because government has left too much uncertainty hanging in the balance in way of potential increases regulations or business taxes. Sounds fair enough but is he right about consumer spending? PolitiFact Ohio consulted the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis which charts spending trends. The most recent information shows that disposal personal income -- meaning money Americans had available to spend after paying typical taxes -- was indeed up eight straight months from September 2010 thru May 2011. June figures were not yet available. And the personal consumption expenditures -- money spent after taxes and typical living expenses -- were up 11 straight months from June 2010 through May 2011. PolitiFact Ohio also thought it would be wise to ask a few economists, people who study the ins and outs and make projections about this stuff everyday, to give the rise in consumer spending some perspective. Dean Baker, a co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, said Kasich is right, but added a caveat. "I would just point that this is an extremely low bar. Consumer spending measured in nominal dollars is almost always rising, except in a severe recession," Baker said. "So, saying that consumer spending is up over the last eight months isn’t too different from saying it is warmer in July than January. We pretty much always expect that to be true." Baker said the rate of growth adjusted for inflation is a better factor for determining consumer spending is really growing to any worthwhile degree. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former economist with the U.S. Department of Labor, offered another significant measure -- comparing consumer spending in a given month compared to the same month one year earlier. Look at the figures that way, and Kasich looks golden again as year-to-year consumer spending has been up for over a year. And he agreed that the rate of grown adjusted for inflation was also a good measure. When seasonally adjusted for inflation, Burtless said that consumer spending actually fell slightly, by one-tenth of a percentage point in two months, April and May. Kasich is correct, though, that consumer spending, measured in inflation-adjusted dollars, has been risen overall the past eight months. In fact, the year-over-year spending comparison shows that real consumer spending has been higher than the year ago amount since December 2009. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kasich’s claim True.

pomt-00739	"The fastest-growing part of the Pentagon’s budget are health care expenses."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/apr/21/evan-bayh/former-senator-evan-bayh-says-fastest-growing-defe/	When former senators Evan Bayh, D-Ind.,and Judd Gregg, R-N.H., made a swing through the state this month promoting their First Budget initiative, they threw around facts and figures like rice at a wedding. The two emphasized the nation’s ever-increasing debt (now at $18.2 trillion) and ongoing deficits ($485 billion for 2014). But amid their calls for voters to hold presidential candidates accountable for the country’s finances, a few nuggets stood out. Both at an appearance at the Rudman Center at the University of New Hampshire School of Law and at an editorial board meeting at the Monitor, Bayh talked about a specific challenge of reining in military spending. "The fastest-growing part of the Pentagon’s budget are health care expenses," said Bayh, a former Senate Armed Services committee member. It’s growing faster than spending on tanks and planes and salaries? Could this be true? We decided to look into the matter. According to Todd Harrison, a senior fellow in defense budget studies at the independent Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Bayh is on the mark. While Bayh’s statement is broad, and one can divide the defense budget into different wedges, health care spending has soared. "Among the main areas of the defense budget (like procurement, R&D, construction, pay, etc.) military healthcare has grown the fastest," Harrison wrote in an email. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found the same trend. According to a report it released last year: "The cost of providing health care to service members, retirees, and their families increased by 130 percent" from 2000 to 2012. But what are the specific numbers? For fiscal year 2016, Harrison said, the military’s projected health care costs are expected to total $48 billion dollars. That sum covers the 9.2 million beneficiaries of Tricare, the Pentagon’s benefits program. Most of that money doesn’t help out frontline troops, either. It pays for benefits to their dependents, or to retirees. The CBO report found total spending of $52 billion in 2012, which is lower than the 2016 projection. But Harrison said any decline is illusory. The Defense Department has included reforms to health care system in its budget request, but Congress "will likely deny many if not all of the reforms," he said. The actual cost would then be higher. Overall, Harrison wrote, military health care costs have "grown from being just 4 percent of the DoD budget in 1990 to 10 percent today." If anything, this undercounts the actual fiscal impact. The Tricare system of military health care coverage is an entirely separate entity from veterans’ health care, which is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ budget. And VA coverage isn’t cheap: It’s likely to cost $62 billion in fiscal year 2016, Harrison said. By the standards of health insurance, Tricare coverage is generous. According to reporting by the Military Times, "active-duty family members . . . pay no annual enrollment fees and no cost-shares to see a physician. Retirees pay $555.84 a year to enroll themselves and their families in Tricare Prime and pay fees ranging from $12 to 20 percent of a bill depending on the care received." The addition of retirees and their families under the so-called Tricare for Life program has been a major driver of the increased costs, the Military Times wrote. In fact, former defense secretary Chuck Hagel warned that the health care expenses were hurting the military’s overall mission. The Pentagon’s greatest fiscal challenge, he said in 2013, was "the growing imbalance in where that money is being spent internally." That is, toward doctors’ bills, not boots on the ground. Competition for the fastest-growing part of the budget is spending to fight terrorism and extremism (called overseas contingency operations). Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, said resources devoted to those operations spiked far higher on a percentage basis. But that depends on how one slices the Pentagon budget and the time frame used to measure growth. According to the Defense Department’s 2016 budget request, overseas contingency operation spending was $22.9 billion in fiscal year 2001, and peaked at $186.9 billion in fiscal year 2008. It’s projected to come back down to $50.9 billion for 2016. In other words, while that spending increased a staggering amount, it has dropped markedly in recent years. In their New Hampshire appearances, Bayh and Gregg said military spending is not the main driver of the United States’ debt and deficits. Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid pose the biggest long-term challenges. Discretionary spending -- which includes spending on the military -- "is not our problem," Gregg said at the Rudman Center. Our ruling Bayh said that "the fastest-growing part of the Pentagon’s budget are health care expenses." There’s little debate that generous military health care benefits are taking up an ever-increasing share of the Pentagon’s budget. While other parts of the budget have spiked, that’s in the past. We rate the statement True.	None	Evan Bayh	None	None	None	2015-04-21T14:43:09	2015-04-02	['None']
pomt-07702	Texas would have to increase current state spending by 28 percent just to reach the national average for spending per resident.	true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/06/scott-mccown/letter-scott-mccown-says-texas-would-have-increase/	Opposing massive cuts in state spending, a former Texas lieutenant governor and a former state district judge recently told business leaders that past Texas Legislatures budgeted so conservatively that state government lags other states in per-person spending. The Feb. 1 letter from Democrats Bill Hobby and Scott McCown to leaders of local chambers of commerce around the state says: "To put in perspective how tight Texas is with a dollar, Texas would have to increase current state spending by 28 percent just to reach average state spending per resident" across the country. Asked the basis for the percentage, McCown, a former state district judge who is now director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, deferred to Eva DeLuna Castro, the center’s senior budget analyst. In an e-mail, DeLuna said she drew on U.S. Census Bureau data to reach the percentage. Nationally in 2009, state governments reported nearly $1.6 trillion in general expenditures. For Texas, the comparable figure was $98 billion, according to information posted online by the bureau. DeLuna told us general expenditures include all money spent by a government in a fiscal year -- net of recoveries and other correcting transactions -- other than for retirement of debt, purchase of investment securities, extension of loans and agency or private trust transactions. She also said the bureau’s total closely tracked what the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters, and state comptroller’s office would typically say that the state spent in 2009. The same year, the U.S. population was estimated at more than 306 million, including nearly 25 million Texans. DeLuna said she reached per-capita spending estimates by dividing the general expenditures by the population estimates. The result: $5,072 for the nation, compared with $3,959 for Texas. Finally, DeLuna said, she calculated what percentage increase would raise the Texas figure to the national average--28 percent. When we checked with the Census Bureau, Cheryl Lee, chief of the state finance and tax statistics branch in its governments division, had no comment on the center’s calculation. She said the bureau doesn’t pair its finance findings with population data to reach per-capita numbers. Separately, Austin economist Stuart Greenfield pointed out two other runs at calculating per-capita state spending comparisons, both of them citing information from the bureau and other sources. A chart posted online by the Washington-based Tax Foundation says that in 2007, Texas state government spent $3,830 per person in state funds, ranking 50th among the states. That year, the foundation says, the national average was $5,446. Based on those figures,Texas would have needed to boost state spending by 42 percent at the time to draw even. But when we ran this past Mark Robyn, the foundation’s staff economist, he cautioned that the 2007 chart is outdated. More recently, a 2009 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows Texas with state spending of $3,630 per person compared to the national average of $5,038--an indication that Texas would have had to increase its spending 39 percent that year to reach the national average. A footnote to the foundation’s research posted online says the spending figures were obtained from the National Association of State Budget Officers. DeLuna of the Austin center said the NASBO total doesn’t take into account some Texas spending that the census bureau counted, such as extra money for state universities and Food Stamp benefits.

pomt-01106	"There have been some estimates that if you deported everybody who is in Texas illegally," it "would create an economic recession for the state."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/jan/09/chuck-todd/chuck-todd-says-there-are-estimates-texas-recessio/	An NBC reporter made us wonder about mass deportations touching off a Texas recession. Chuck Todd, who hosts the "Meet the Press" program, quizzed Texas Gov.-elect Greg Abbott on a December 2014 edition of the program about the costs to Texas of schooling and otherwise serving individuals living in the state and country without legal authorization. But, Todd suggested, the same immigrants support the state’s economy, adding: "There have been some estimates that if you deported everybody who is in Texas illegally, it would actually be an economic—it would create an economic recession for the state of Texas." Abbott replied by saying legal immigration has been good for the country. We didn’t hear back from Todd’s office about which estimates he was thinking of to conclude that if every resident not authorized to live in Texas was deported, the state’s economy would be hammered. Meantime, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas told us through spokesman James Hoard it’s unaware of research on the economic impact should every unauthorized resident of the state be deported. But a bank economist, Pia Orrenius, said by email: "If you take a million workers out of the Texas labor force, economic activity will contract." Another expert on the Texas economy, Southern Methodist University economist Bernard Weinstein, said he was unaware of fresh looks at the effects of deporting all unauthorized Texas workers. Generally, he emailed, "Texas has had the most robust economy of any large state over the past five years, accounting for about 30 percent of all the jobs created nationwide. Without question, our large immigrant population—both legal and illegal—has contributed to that growth. I don’t know that deporting all of Texas’ undocumented workers would cause an outright recession, but it would certainly impose some real pain on a number of industries such as agriculture, hospitality (hotels and restaurants), and residential construction/maintenance." Robert Wood, a spokesman for the Texas Association of Business, replied to our inquiry by pointing out a May 2008 Houston Chronicle news story on a study overseen by economist Ray Perryman of Waco as possibly relevant. According to the story, Perryman calculated that Texas would lose more than 1 million residents if all unauthorized workers vanished overnight, costing the economy. Wood also noted a May 2013 Texas Tribune news story quoting data compiled by a Washington, D.C., think tank, the Immigration Policy Center, stating that mass deportations in the state, home to an estimated 1.6 million unauthorized immigrants, would cost the economy billions of dollars. "If all unauthorized immigrants were removed from Texas, the state would lose $69.3 billion in economic activity, $30.8 billion in gross state product, and approximately 403,174 jobs, even accounting for adequate market adjustment time," the center said. We followed up with Perryman, who emailed his firm’s April 2008 report to us while cautioning that all its figures and projections would be different by now given changes over time. Sudden deportations, sudden recession? The 2008 Perryman report didn’t predict a recession anywhere in the U.S. in the event of mass deportations. Still, it said, the "undocumented workforce comprises a notable percentage of total workers in many industrial and occupational categories, which are becoming increasingly difficult for employers to fill. Without undocumented workers, notable labor shortages would emerge, and significant economic dislocations would occur." Whether Texas went into a recession, Perryman told us by email, "would depend on the circumstances. If the entire workforce were removed quickly with no time to adjust, it would cause a recession. That outcome is very unlikely. If it were done on a more-phased basis with time to respond, it would still likely take a heavy toll, but an all-out recession might be avoidable," he wrote. Perryman continued: "The difficulty lies in the percentage of the Texas workforce filled by undocumented workers." The 2008 report estimated unauthorized residents to comprised 9 percent of Texas workers in 2007, compared with 5 percent nationwide. In his email, Perryman went on: "Even if every unemployed person in the Texas labor force today could and would fill one of those slots (which is obviously not the case), the state would be short several hundred thousand workers. Those jobs would have to be filled by recruiting from other areas (which would also be facing similar situations, though in most cases not as severe) or, replaced by technology (which takes time, etc.). It would also disproportionately affect some key industries that support growth and exports (such as construction and agriculture). "I guess the bottom line is that, under any circumstances, it would cause a lot of disruptions. Under most circumstances, it would cause a recession with the magnitude and duration depending on the specific plan. Under a few programs (a very gradual phase-in combined with mechanisms to replace the workers with ‘documented’ ones, which would require real, comprehensive immigration reform), a recession could be averted. Whatever the politics, the sheer numbers make a quick deportation very difficult to manage," Perryman said. 2012 study Also to our inquiry, spokesman Ed Sills of the Texas AFL-CIO pointed out an August 2012 report from the liberal Center for American Progress estimating that in Texas or any of six other states, "deporting even a portion of the unauthorized immigrants would lead to significant losses in gross state product, worker wages and tax revenues." The report, undertaken by Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, an associate professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said unauthorized immigrants comprised 7.2 percent, or 1.02 million, of Texas workers and accounted for $14.5 billion in taxes paid in the state in 2010. (The report said its population estimates drew on the U.S. Census Bureau and Pew Hispanic Center.) The report didn’t use "recession" in its description of probable Texas outcomes. Still, it said, removing "all of the undocumented immigrants from Texas would have substantial, indeed devastating, consequences for everyone remaining in the state. Driving undocumented immigrants out of Texas would lead to substantially diminished earnings, decreased gross state product and lost tax revenue for the state government." The state’s gross state product, the report said, would be reduced by more than $77.7 billion, or 6 percent, if the "undocumented population were driven from the state." Another voice We also consulted Bob Dane of the Washington, D.C.-based Federation for American Immigration Reform, which focuses on the costs of immigration, particularly illegal immigration. Dane suggested the idea of sudden mass deportations is obviously absurd. Still, if they happened, Dane said by phone, there would be short-term inconveniences, even chaos. But over time, he said, vacancies would be filled by job-seeking legal residents—and wages would rise. The Perryman report said that nationally mass removals would result in the immediate loss of 8.1 million jobs, but the reduction would shrink to 2.8 million jobs once businesses and remaining workers adjusted. In Texas, the report said, there would ultimately be 403,174 jobs wiped out, compared to 1.15 million jobs lost immediately after unauthorized residents were removed. Our ruling Todd, addressing Abbott, said there had been "some estimates that if you deported everybody who is in Texas illegally… it would create an economic recession for the state." It’s hard to overlook that Todd’s statement was premised on hypothetical mass deportations no one expects to occur. That glitch aside, economists have said the Texas economy would suffer without its unauthorized workers, but we didn’t find "recession" estimates. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

The claim resurfaced Aug. 3, 2017, in an article titled, "Human Meat Found In McDonald’s Meat" on theamericaninsider.org: "This shocking report impelled food inspectors to investigate the matter further. What is even more shocking, allegedly they have found human and horse meat in the freezers of an Oklahoma City McDonald’s meat factory. In addition, inspectors found human meat in several trucks on their way to deliver the burgers to the fast food restaurants. "Lloyd Harrison is FBI agent, and for Huzler he stated: ‘The worst part is that it’s not only human meat, it’s child meat. The body parts were found across the US factories and were deemed too small to be adult body parts. This is truly horrible,’" read the post. The post never discloses the name or publication of the report that would maintain the validity of the article, but it does divulge the name of the website that originated this meaty tale. The story first began on Huzlers.com. Huzlers, a website that specializes in publishing joke articles about topics that are trending on social media, published the original article in March 2014, according to the debunking website Snopes. Readers who believed the post took to social media to accuse McDonald’s of using human meat and questioning the contents of their burgers. The fast-food company affirms that their patties are made out of 100 percent real beef. Although the story is still circulating three years after its publication, there is no record of McDonald’s trying to feed diners human flesh. In 2016, a Bay Area food lab took a stab at trying to discover surprise ingredients in burgers. The lab got a combined 258 meat and veggie sample patties from different retailers and fast food chains in Northern California and tested them for missing or unexpected ingredients. Out of the 258 test samples they found that one burger contained a minute trace of DNA that was likely left by a factory worker who came into contact with the product. The report does not disclose where each sample was from but it does explain that the patty found with the human DNA was a veggie burger, a menu item that is not served in American McDonald’s.

pomt-05885	Newt Gingrich "was fined $300,000 for ethics violations."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/07/restore-our-future/did-newt-gingrich-pay-300000-ethics-fine-back-1990/	EDITOR’S NOTE: We originally ruled this claim True. A short time later, we were contacted by an attorney who represented Gingrich during the ethics proceeding and who disputed that Gingrich was "fined" by the ethics committee. The lawyer said Gingrich had paid a "cost assessment." We decided to take a second look at the issue and decided to change the ruling to Mostly True. *** A pro-Mitt Romney "Super PAC" is flexing its muscles in the Republican race for president, telling conservative voters not to fall for Barack Obama’s plan to hand Newt Gingrich the GOP nomination. The group, called Restore our Future, is running television ads in Iowa and Florida. "Barack Obama’s plan is working: Destroy Mitt Romney, run against Newt Gingrich," the ad says. "Newt has a ton of baggage. He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations and took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, before it helped cause the economic meltdown. Newt supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming. Maybe that’s why George Will calls him the least conservative candidate. Check the facts at NewtFacts.com." Super PACs aren’t formally affiliated with campaigns, but they can still spend money to try to influence elections, and they don’t face the same disclosure requirements as official campaigns. In this case, Restore our Future is run by supporters of Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. The ad makes a lot of claims. Here, we wanted to check whether Gingrich "was fined $300,000 for ethics violations." Gingrich’s ethics violations date back to the 1990s, when Gingrich taught a course at Kennesaw State College while serving in Congress. The organizers of the course solicited financial support from "individuals, corporations and foundations," promising that the project qualified for tax-exempt status. But an ethics committee investigation concluded that the course was "actually a coordinated effort" to "help in achieving a partisan, political goal" -- something that would run afoul of its tax-exempt status. A further problem for Gingrich was that during the investigation, he submitted letters from his lawyers for which "the subcommittee was unable to find any factual basis." Gingrich "should have known" that the information in the letters "was inaccurate, incomplete, and unreliable," the investigation found. The allegations were largely adjudicated by January 1997, with Gingrich agreeing to pay a sum of $300,000 and admitting that he had "engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives." He became the first speaker to be sanctioned in this fashion by the House. (Here’s a time line of the case.) During this year’s campaign, Gingrich said that the investigation was conducted by "a very partisan political committee" in a way that "related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics." We rated that statement Pants on Fire. (Read our fact-check for more details.) As we’ve noted before, Gingrich’s intensely partisan style and his heavy use of the congressional ethics process against others ramped up the level of partisan warfare during his investigation. But, the investigation itself moved forward with bipartisan support. The ethics panel’s case had the consent of Republicans, including the committee’s chairwoman, and it was led by a special counsel who was not a Democratic partisan and who focused on substantive legal matters. Most notably, when it came time to vote, the House -- including nearly 90 percent of voting Republicans -- voted to support the committee’s recommendation. At any rate, the investigating subcommittee released its findings to the full committee on Dec. 21, 1996. It recommended "a reprimand and the payment of $300,000 toward the cost of the preliminary inquiry." On Jan. 17, 1997, the full committee held nearly six hours of televised hearings, then voted 7 to 1 to accept the subcommittee’s recommendation. The full House went on to pass the ethics report 395 to 28, with 196 Republicans voting for it and 26 voting against it. The question of whether the $300,000 payment was a fine attracted some debate at the time, and continues to do so today. After our initial analysis resulted in a rating of True -- archived here -- J. Randolph Evans of the law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge and one of Gingrich’s lawyers in the ethics case wrote us to question our ruling. "Based upon the actual language of the House Committee report itself, it is clear that Speaker Gingrich was only asked to reimburse the House $300,000 to offset some costs of the Committee’s investigation. No fine was ever levied against the speaker," Evans wrote. He also criticized us for promoting our fact-check via Twitter. "Any statement in any broadcast communication supporting the notion that Speaker Gingrich paid a congressional fine is wholly inaccurate, and should be characterized that way by PolitiFact. More significantly, in light of controlling authority on this issue, any additional publication by PolitiFact that supports the truth of such a statement will be considered knowingly false," he wrote. Evans has a point that the committee’s official findings do not mention the word "fine." Instead, the report recommends that Gingrich receive "a reprimand and a payment reimbursing the House for some of the costs of the investigation in the amount of $300,000." Lawyers with expertise in political law agreed with Evans’ point about the committee’s decision not to label it a "fine." But these experts also warned against interpreting the levy as merely a reimbursement, saying it’s hard to view it as anything but a penalty against Gingrich. "I think it is fair to say that the $300,000 was assessed as a punitive measure, and there would have been no such assessment if the ethics committee thought he was free from wrongdoing," Kenneth A. Gross, the head of the political law practice at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. "It really is matter of characterization and even semantics. It was not a fine in a legal sense but a punitive measure." Other experts agreed. "I suspect that the committee never asks a person to pay $300,000 for its investigation costs if the result of the investigation was to find the person completely blameless," said legal commentator Stuart Taylor. "The payment was meant to penalize Gingrich personally for lying to Committee investigators, so it could fairly be called a ‘penalty’ from a layman’s point of view," said Brett Kappel, a counsel with the firm Arent Fox LLP. It’s also worth noting that the head of the committee that investigated and reprimanded Gingrich said at the time that, although the committee didn’t officially call it a fine, she personally considered it to be a fine. As the House was preparing to vote on the ethics panel’s findings, the chair of the House ethics committee, Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., had this exchange with Katie Couric of NBC News: Couric: "Do you view this $300,000 as a fine or to compensate for the cost of the investigation?" Johnson: "Well, it can be seen either way." Couric: "How do you see it?" Johnson: "I see it personally as a fine." Another view: The Congressional Research Service, in a 2005 report, said the sum paid by Gingrich "was not characterized by the Committee as a ‘fine,’ " but CRS did use the term "penalty" to describe it. To cut through the semantic fog, we turned to Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist at the University of California at Berkeley. He said it’s fair for a media outlet to describe the fee Gingrich paid as a "fine" or to write that Gingrich was "fined." "Some people distinguish fines and charges for costs, but the verb 'fine' is also routinely used as including costs," he said. He sent us several examples of courts noting that their fines included court costs. "The implication that since the penalty charged Gingrich was not a ‘fine’ there was no imputation of guilt or violation of ethics rules is simply false: People are not held responsible for costs if the charges are found groundless," he said. A footnote: Gingrich paid off the $300,000 in installments, according to contemporaneous news accounts. At one point he was even going to borrow money from former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. But by the end of 1998 Gingrich had finished paying the fine without Dole’s help. Our ruling The Super PAC Restore Our Future made a linguistic overstep when it labeled the $300,000 payment a "fine," since the ethics committee never used that precise term. But the underlying point of the pro-Romney Super PAC ad remains valid. Although the payment was not technically a "fine," it was a penalty. The committee reprimanded Gingrich and assessed him a sum of $300,000. The chair of the committee said on national television that despite the panel’s word choice, she personally considered it to be a fine. It is common in many legal settings for court costs to be included in fines. And an array of legal experts told us that the avoidance of the word "fine" in describing the payment does not suggest vindication for Gingrich; rather, they said, the payment was clearly intended to be punitive. On balance we rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Restore Our Future	None	None	None	2012-02-07T16:40:55	2011-12-14	['None']
pomt-07464	"The costs of cancer and all affiliated issues are over $20 billion a year to this state."	true	/texas/statements/2011/apr/18/jim-keffer/texas-rep-jim-keffer-says-cancer-and-related-issue/	Opposing a proposal to reduce the amount of money that the state puts toward cancer research, Republican state Rep. Jim Keffer of Eastland focused on the financial impact the disease has on Texans. Addressing the measure’s author, GOP Rep. Rob Orr of Burleson, Keffer said in House debate April 3: "Do you know … that the costs of cancer and all affiliated issues are over $20 billion a year to this state? So that is the reason that this is such a great program. We are having successes, and, really, to tamper with or harm it now … it’d be detrimental." We wondered whether Keffer was right about cancer costs to Texas. First, some background: In 2007, with the backing of Gov. Rick Perry and bicycling superstar and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong, the Legislature voted to ask Texans to approve the sale of $3 billion in bonds over 10 years to finance cancer research grants. Voters gave the OK that fall, and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas was created to dole out the money. Orr’s 2011 measure, which the House rejected, would have reduced the annual sale of the cancer bonds by one-third over the next biennium. In response to our inquiry, Keffer’s chief of staff, Ky Ash, told us that the $20 billion cost statistic was a reference to May 2007 testimony by consultant and lobbyist Billy Hamilton, a former deputy state comptroller, before the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. During that hearing, which we reviewed online, Hamilton said he was not speaking for any group or agency in addressing "the financial aspects" of cancer in Texas. He pointed to a 2001 study commissioned by the Texas Comprehensive Cancer Control Coalition, a public-private group that is now known as the Cancer Alliance of Texas, and conducted by a research team led by David Warner, a professor of health and social policy at the University of Texas’ LBJ School of Public Affairs. The study estimated the total economic impact of cancer on Texas in 1998 as about $14 billion. According to the study, about $5 billion of the total represented "direct costs," including hospitalization and other treatments, cancer screenings and medications, plus spending on research and other cancer-related programs by state agencies, nonprofit groups and private foundations. The remaining $9 billion reflected "indirect costs" — in this case, the value of the economic activity lost because someone was sick with or died from cancer. For example, the researchers estimated how much income and other economic benefits people who died of cancer in 1998 would have produced had they lived to their age group’s average life expectancy. So, Hamilton testified, the $14 billion total included numerous costs — including to the government, to families, in lost wages and in insurance — "rolled together." He then told the senators that he had drawn on the study to make a conservative estimate for the cost of cancer in Texas in 2008: "just under $30 billion." Noted: That’s quite a bit greater than Keffer’s aired figure. In an e-mail, Hamilton told us that he no longer has the original information that supported his analysis, but he said he reached his estimate by updating the 2001 figure using newer data on cancer incidence in Texas, plus demographic and economic figures and information on cancer costs. Hamilton said he believed his estimate was conservative because his price assumptions were closer to the general inflation rate than the increase in the costs of medical care, which is greater. Next, we looked for other research on the costs of cancer in Texas. Christine Mann, an assistant press officer at the Texas Department of State Health Services, pointed us to an analysis conducted by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. It put the 2007 cost number at about $22 billion: $10 billion in direct costs and $12 billion in indirect costs. The March 2009 report, commissioned by the Texas Cancer Registry, says the researchers’ methodology combined an adaptation of a recently published National Cancer Institute approach with methods used by the LBJ School’s Warner in 2001. From 1998 to 2007, the more recent report says, the cost of cancer in Texas increased for several reasons, including an increase in the number of older Texans, rising health care costs and more expensive treatments. For information about cancer trends in Texas, we turned to the Texas Cancer Registry, a collaboration between the Texas Department of State Health Services, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. A February 2010 report says that although cancer rates (the number of new cases per 100,000 people) have been declining in recent years, the number of new cancer cases has been rising because of "the increasing size and aging of the Texas population." According to the Cancer Registry, there were 95,607 new cancer cases in Texas in 2007, the most recent data available. That’s an increase of 3.6 percent from the year before. Finally, we found an analysis of the 2010 costs of cancer in the state. Done by the Perryman Group, a Waco-based economic analysis firm, the report updates the direct and indirect cost estimate to about $25.3 billion. However, the report, conducted for the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, says Perryman "developed a more comprehensive measure of the cost of cancer in terms of Texas business activity," including both losses stemming from treatment, illness and death — as the earlier studies measured — and "spillover effects," which it considers "further reductions in business activity." Those additional reductions push estimated Texas economic losses to more than $150 billion and nearly 700,000 jobs, the Perryman report says. Finally, we looked for national expertise on the costs of cancer at the state level, finding none. Summing up: Keffer claimed that cancer and its related issues cost Texas upwards of $20 billion a year. Most of that figure is pegged to indirect costs. That said, the most recent research we found consistently pegged the total annual cost at considerably more than $20 billion. We rate Keffer’s statement True.

pomt-11724	The House tax bill has "a lot more permanent relief for middle-income and even lower-income families" than the Senate bill does.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/dec/14/carlos-curbelo/does-house-tax-bill-make-more-changes-permanent-se/	As the House and Senate were finishing the details of a joint version of the Republican-backed tax bill, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., was defending the House’s version as friendlier to Americans of modest means. In an appearance on Miami’s WPLG-TV on Dec. 10, Curbelo was asked about the pattern of Americans being projected to gain from the GOP tax bills in the first few years after it’s passed, but then paying more in taxes closer to 10 years after passage. Curbelo responded to the question by touting the advantages of the House-passed version compared with the Senate-passed version. "The House bill does have a lot more permanent relief for middle income and even lower income families long term, permanently," Curbelo replied. "The Senate bill, their budget rules are different so they had to put these gimmicks in the bill, frankly. We, in conference, are insisting on the House provisions to make the middle-class relief permanent." We wondered whether Curbelo was correct that he House bill has "a lot more permanent relief for middle-income and even lower-income families" than the Senate bill does. Long-lasting tax cuts Curbelo is correct that in the House’s version of the tax bill, several key provisions -- its replacement of seven existing tax brackets with four, the raising of the standard deduction, and an expanded child tax credit -- are permanent. All of these provisions in the Senate bill expire after 2025. There’s only one significant provision in the House bill that would expire -- a family tax credit worth $300 credit for the taxpayer, spouse, and non-child dependents. That provision sunsets in 2022 under the House bill. (A similar, $500 credit in the Senate bill would expire in 2025.) The pattern of eventual tax increases in the Senate bill is stronger than from the House bill, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation found. By 2027, every income group below $100,000 would see an increase, on average. So Curbelo has a point that several key House provisions are written to be permanent, unlike the equivalent provisions of the Senate bill. Why that’s not the whole picture It’s important to note, however, that sunsetting provisions aren’t the only cause of later tax increases. Other factors the following provisions of the House bill (and also the Senate bill): • The amount of the child credit is not indexed for inflation. By contrast, the provision it effectively replaces -- the personal exemption -- is indexed for inflation. • The rate brackets would grow more slowly from year to year because they would be adjusted by a less generous measure of inflation. • The earned income tax credit -- a refundable credit for low-income Americans who are employed -- would also increase more slowly because of the same change to the inflation measurement. Our ruling Curbelo said the House tax bill has "a lot more permanent relief for middle-income and even lower-income families." That’s generally the case: Only one provision of the House bill that’s likely to be claimed by Americans of modest incomes, a family tax credit, would expire within the first decade, whereas many key provisions in the Senate bill would sunset early. However, it’s worth noting that the expiration of provisions is not the only reason that taxpayers are projected to pay more closer to 10 years after the bill’s passage. Another one, unmentioned by Curbelo, is changed treatment of inflation adjustments in the House bill. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11740	"I released way more (tax) information than Bruce Rauner has."	false	/illinois/statements/2017/dec/11/jb-pritzker/no-jb-pritzker-did-not-release-more-tax-informatio/	We recently rated "True" a statement from Democratic gubernatorial candidate Daniel Biss that attacked the tax transparency of rivals JB Pritzker and Chris Kennedy. Biss said the other candidates had released no more information about their personal finances than did Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner--and that wasn’t much at all. The issue quickly flared up again as Rauner said the income Pritzker reported on his tax returns was too puny for a man whose net worth has been estimated at more than $3 billion. The governor’s campaign ran an ad questioning whether Pritzker was an "incompetent investor" or "stashing his cash overseas" and "refusing to pay his fair share" of taxes. Rauner offered no proof for either contention, though it is worth noting that he was attacked with similar hazy claims during his 2014 election campaign that suggested he dodged taxes by routing investments through a Cayman Islands tax haven. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As reported in the Chicago Sun-Times, Pritzker fired back: "It’s laughable that Bruce Rauner is complaining about my taxes," Pritzker said after a Democratic gubernatorial candidates’ forum at the historic Second Presbyterian Church on the South Side. "I released way more information than Bruce Rauner has, and it’s important to recognize that unlike Bruce Rauner, who, yeah, he paid taxes, but you know how he made his money? By cutting jobs. By buying companies and firing people." Setting aside the campaign rhetoric of Pritzker’s response, we were struck by his statement that he had released "way more information" about his taxes than Rauner. That’s not what we found last week, so we took another look. Rhetoric vs. reality Rauner, a wealthy private equity investor, has made a practice of releasing 1040 tax forms that give just a hazy outline of his annual earnings and taxes paid. He released three years of tax returns -- for 2010, 2011 and 2012 -- when he first filed to run for governor in 2013 and has continued to release his 1040s every year since then. Illinois law requires no tax disclosure from candidates, but until Rauner it had been common for candidates for the state’s top office to voluntarily disclose the entire contents of their tax returns in a gesture of transparency. For wealthier candidates like Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy, the two-page 1040 is just a tiny piece of their returns. The more telling information is contained in what are likely dozens or hundreds of pages of schedules, forms and supporting documents attached to 1040s that detail how investment and capital gains income was derived, business losses or gains, and deductions for charitable donations. "I don't know that 1040s are really all that useful without the rest of the supporting materials," Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, told us for last week’s fact-check. "I suppose that they're better than nothing, except that I think you encourage further disclosures of just the 1040s." Rauner has never released those supporting materials, nor did Pritzker or Kennedy when they disclosed the contents of recent 1040s in late November. All three candidates pitch themselves as accomplished businessmen with shrewd financial acumen, so it is significant that none are willing to release the documentation that could help voters better assess the accuracy of such claims. By contrast, Biss, a state senator whose annual income is mostly derived from his legislative salary, did make a complete tax disclosure. That’s why he sarcastically taunted Pritzker and Kennedy in a recent tweet about "pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard" when it came to tax transparency. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Just as Rauner did as a first-time candidate in 2013, Pritzker released three years’ worth of 1040 forms when he filed his nominating petitions. They showed adjusted gross income of $14,950,446 in 2016, $9,974,627 in 2015, and $3,137,655 in 2014. His effective tax rates were 27.7 percent (2016), 24.3 percent (2015) and 37.3 percent (2014). Accompanying the state and federal 1040 forms was a brief press release listing the income and tax rates paid, the amounts in federal and state taxes paid by trusts from which Pritzker benefits ($128.97 million and $24.95 million, respectively) and charitable giving by Pritzker himself and by his foundation ($15.3 million and $53.8 million, respectively). Rauner also has regularly issued statements on charitable giving with his returns. When we asked what constituted "way more" on Pritzker’s returns, the Pritzker campaign pointed to a statement he also released about taxes paid by trusts of which he is a beneficiary. Pritzker is descended from a family of wealthy entrepreneurs who launched the Hyatt Hotel chain, and his fortune is derived in part from inheritances passed down through trusts. Pritzker did not release the trust tax forms themselves, however, so there is no way to independently verify the accuracy of that disclosure. That said, holding out the trust numbers as the evidence for more fulsome disclosure than Rauner is a curious tactic. As Rauner often points out, his fortune was self-made, he inherited no money and receives no income from trusts. In short, Rauner has made no trust disclosures because he says he has no trusts. Our ruling Pritzker said he "released way more information than Bruce Rauner has" on income taxes. But Pritzker’s three years’ worth of 1040 state and federal cover sheets are identical to the sort of disclosure Rauner released as a candidate four years ago and what he has issued each year since. Pritzker did release information about taxes paid by trusts that benefit him, but construing that as exceeding Rauner’s disclosure is something of a straw-man argument. Rauner says he has no trusts to report income from. We rate Pritzker’s statement False. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	JB Pritzker	None	None	None	2017-12-11T05:00:00	2017-12-06	['None']
pomt-11406	"It happened under Obama, and it was lauded by the media as being genius. And now under the Trump campaign — it’s the Cambridge Analytica scandal."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/22/meghan-mccain/comparing-facebook-data-use-obama-cambridge-analyt/	As news reports surfaced of Cambridge Analytica and the Donald Trump campaign, conservatives pointed to what seemed a double-standard. On ABC’s The View, co-host Meghan McCain said former President Barack Obama was met with praise when he used similar Facebook data for his campaign, whereas Trump was met with outrage. "It happened under Obama and it was lauded by the media as being genius," McCain said. "And now under the Trump campaign — it’s the Cambridge Analytica scandal." "Was it the same thing?" co-host Joy Behar asked. "Yeah," McCain said. "It was micro-targeting and data mining." "I think it’s different, though," said co-host Sunny Hostin. "It’s not different, though!" McCain exclaimed. So, was it the same thing? While the data the two campaigns had access to was largely the same, the way they accessed it, and for what purpose, was very different. "She was making the point that the Obama re-election campaign used a similar tactic through Facebook to gain access to the personal information of millions of voters," ABC spokeswoman Lauri Hogan clarified. The data Under the way Facebook allowed its apps to operate between 2010 and 2015, Obama’s 2012 re-election app and the survey app used by Cambridge Analytica had access not only to their users’ profiles but their friends’ list and their biographical information. When the user approved it, these apps could access details such as users’ and their friends’ tags, likes and demographics. Over a million people downloaded the Obama for America app. Around 300,000 people downloaded the personality survey app that ended up sending their data to Cambridge Analytica. The number of users’ data the firm reportedly gained access to (50 million) is much higher because it includes the users’ friends. The number of user data, it follows, was much higher for the Obama campaign, too. How it was accessed The real divergence is in the way each campaign accessed the data. The Obama campaign created a Facebook app for supporters to donate, learn of voting requirements, and find nearby houses to canvass. The app asked users’ permission to scan their photos, friends lists, and news feeds. Most users complied. The people signing up knew the data they were handing over would be used to support a political campaign. Their friends, however, did not. The people who downloaded the app used by Cambridge Analytica did not know their data would be used to aid any political campaigns. The app was billed as a personality quiz that would be used by Cambridge University researchers. Aleksandr Kogan, one of the Cambridge researchers involved in the project, sold the data to the upstart political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The company then sold its services not only to the Trump campaign, but to the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz and the senatorial campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., among others. When Facebook discovered a developer had shared users’ data without their consent in 2015, it asked both the original app and the consultancy to delete the data. That didn’t happen. "The thing that is true is that every Facebook app you downloaded back then was getting access to your entire friends list," said David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. "When tech people were trying to raise outrage about it they were being ignored. Now, everyone is outraged. But what (McCain) is wrong about this is that Kogan then sold it, and for a much creepier purpose." How it was used Obama operatives used Facebook data to get users to send their messaging for them, according to Eitan Hersh, a Tufts professor who wrote Hacking the Electorate, a book on Obama’s microtargeting strategies. Facebook friends lists, tags and photos allowed Obama operatives to identify a person’s close friends, which they then matched with offline public records. (Was this person likely to vote for Obama, but unlikely to get out to vote?) They then told the app users which of their friends they should send campaign messages to. Cambridge Analytica dialed up what Karpf called the creepiness factor. They combined the survey results with the Facebook data to create psychological profiles they then sold to campaigns. The idea was, if the firm could discover how these people thought, they could target ads toward them. Cambridge Analytica then sent targeted ads to the users on their database as well as users with similar profiles, identified by Facebook’s Lookalike tool. The friends of the app users weren’t being targeted by their friends, but by the campaign itself. In other words, the consenting middle man was gone. In his research, Hersh found that neither tactic was greatly effective at persuading people to vote. Our ruling McCain said that there was a strong equivalence between how the Obama and Trump campaigns accessed user data on Facebook. The Obama campaign and Cambridge Analytica both gained access to huge amounts of information about Facebook users and their friends, and in neither case did the friends of app users consent. But in Obama’s case, direct users knew they were handing over their data to a political campaign. In the Cambridge Analytica case, users only knew were taking a personality quiz for academic purposes. The Obama campaign used the data to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends. Cambridge Analytica targeted users, friends and lookalikes directly with digital ads. Whereas the data gathering and the uses were very different, the data each campaign gained access to was similar. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-07169	"Ten percent of violent deaths in the U.S. each year are due to strangulation."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jun/12/roberto-dasilva/ri-rep-dasilva-says-1-10-violent-deaths-us-are-cau/	Last month, the House, on a vote of 59-11, passed legislation that would make it a felony to attempt to strangle or choke someone, even if the attack did not result in any injury to the victim. The bill, H-5087, is now before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The proposal is intended, in part, to make it easier to prosecute anyone who applies pressure on a person's throat or neck with the intent to cause harm. The chief advocate, Rep. Roberto DaSilva, a Pawtucket police officer, said he submitted it because he was seeing too many cases in which serious strangulation attempts would be prosecuted as misdemeanor simple assaults because the attack, although potentially fatal, didn't result in obvious signs of serious bodily injury. "If you take a knife, swing it at someone and not strike them, that's a felony," he said. "Under this law, strangulation itself would be a felony. When you have your hands around their throat, you've taken it to the next level. It's serious enough." But it was his assertion about the prevalence of the crime that caught our attention. "Ten percent of violent deaths in the U.S. each year are due to strangulation," he said, adding that there are "six female victims to every male victim." We wondered if the rate was really that high. DaSilva sent us a handful of documents. One was a 2001 article from the Journal of Emergency Medicine, which flatly stated that "Ten percent of violent deaths each year in the United States are directly because of strangulation." Where did that statistic come from? Although the article has 35 footnotes, the "ten percent" statement carries no citation. Two of the three authors, Dr. George E. McClane and Gael B. Strack, a lawyer, have apparently been using this statistic for a while. DaSilva also directed us to a 1999 article in which McClane and Strack are quoted as making the same claim. Strack has repeated the statistic as recently as a 2007 article written to help prosecutors. In each case, there is no indication where the data come from. We emailed Strack, who is CEO of the Family Justice Center Alliance in San Diego; she told us it came from a paper written by McClane in 1995, which we found intriguing because no McClane research is cited in their 2001 article. Researchers are typically quick to cite their previous work each time they write a paper. We couldn't get an interview with McClane. The website of the Medical Board of California of the Department of Consumer Affairs said he surrendered his medical license in March after being found guilty of unprofessional conduct. His lawyer did not respond to an email. So we took another route. DaSilva had also sent us an article from 2007, also in the Journal of Emergency Medicine, saying that national data from 1993 showed that 11.8 percent of women and 1.9 percent of men who died that year were killed by strangulation. It didn't give an overall rate. So we went to the source: a 2003 article on firearm deaths by David Wiebe of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. It says the strangulation rate that year was 3.4 percent. That's 1 in 29, not 1 in 10. But that 3.4 percent does not include all violence-related deaths, as DaSilva did. Suicides are excluded. If you include them, as the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control does when it catalogues all "violence-related injury deaths," the rate is even lower -- about 1.4 percent, or 1 in 71. That same difference is echoed in the most recent federal data, where strangulation accounted for only about 1.2 percent of the violence-related deaths in 2007. If you only look at homicides, the rate rises, but only to 3.5 percent, still far shy of 10 percent. Only when we focused on women who have been murdered did the 10-percent figure apply. Wiebe directed us to the 1998 version of the database, where 448 of the 4,241 female homicide deaths were logged as being due to strangulation. That's 10.6 percent. We calculated a similar number for 2007. (The actual numbers show that there were not six female strangulation victims for every male, as DaSilva said. Because 448 women and 213 men died of strangulation in 2008, the actual ratio was 2 to 1. To hit a 6-to-1 ratio, you have to compare the percentages of homicide deaths due to strangulation -- 10.6 percent for women and 1.6 percent for men.) In short, the "10 percent" statistic cited by DaSilva has been bandied about at least since the 1990s. As presented, it is false. Federal data from 1993, 1998 and 2007 show that the percentage is significantly lower, whether or not you include suicides. It may be that the federal statistics are being repeatedly misrepresented, taking numbers that were only meant to apply to female homicides and expanding them to include all violent deaths, regardless of gender. If DaSilva had said that "10 percent of all homicide deaths among women are due to strangulation" and that "women who are murdered are six times more likely to die of strangulation than men who are murdered," he would be on solid ground. But he didn't. In his defense, he was quoting sources that should be reliable. The Journal of Emergency Medicine, for one, failed to display adequate rigor by allowing the 10-percent estimate to appear without attribution. And DaSilva is trying to address what he sees as a serious problem, especially in domestic assaults on women. Deborah DeBare, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said her organization has been concerned for a few years that strangulation assaults are not being aggressively prosecuted, even though they "are one of the most dangerous ways of attacking someone." And because they are often carried out by a coldly calculating assailant, she said, the hope is that the stronger threat of jail time might be a deterrent for some men. But we make our rulings based on whether a statement is actually true or false. Motive doesn't enter into it unless we're considering a Pants On Fire. In this case, we rate DaSilva's claim as Barely True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.) Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08419	Says the Annie's List political group supports third-trimester abortions on demand.	false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/20/dwayne-bohac/texas-rep-dwayne-bohac-says-annies-list-supports-t/	Lies, truth, honesty: Anytime campaign literature shows up peppered with these words, we perk up. So it was when a reader, Randall Horton, passed along a recent mailer from state Rep. Dwayne Bohac, R-Houston, which opens: "Honesty matters, especially in politics." The Truth-O-Meter kicked in at Bohac's reference to Annie's List, a Texas group dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women. His leaflet calls the group "a liberal special-interest group who supports third-trimester abortion on demand." Is that so? Some background: Annie's List was founded in 2003, its website says. According to Robert Jones, its political director, the group was modeled on the nationally established EMILY's List, which describes itself as "dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women to office." EMILY is an acronym: Early Money Is Like Yeast. And, as Bohac's mailer says, Annie's List backs Bohac's Democratic challenger, Kendra Yarbrough Camarena. Through Sept. 23, state records show, Camarena had received about $77,000 from Annie's List, accounting for about 26 percent percent of her contributions since March 2009. UPDATE, 10:45 a.m. Oct. 21, 2010: After we published this article, a Bohac campaign consultant, Bryan Eppstein, pointed to information backing up another Bohac claim that Annie's List has contributed more than $100,000 to Camarena's cause. His figure takes into account both the group's direct contributions to Camarena's campaign, which we tallied for our original article, and indirect contributions that to date have been reported only by Annie's List; these include expenditures for pro-Camarena direct mail, campaign staff and software. Also, the reader who forwarded Bohac's mailer gave us permission to include his name in this article. How to regulate late-term abortions has proved to be a simmering national issue. In 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act outlawing a procedure known medically as "intact dilation and extraction." The U.S. Supreme Court later upheld the law, which had been challenged by physicians and abortion-rights activists who said the procedure is often the safest to use late in a pregnancy because it "minimizes the chances of injury to the uterus," according to an April 2007 recap by The New York Times. When does a pregnancy become "late-term"? Elizabeth Nash — a public policy expert at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health — told us that the term "is more of a political or layperson term" and that "people have all sorts of ideas about its definition." Generally speaking, she said, any point past the 18th week of pregnancy, counting from the last menstrual period, could be considered "late term." The third trimester is typically thought to begin at the 28-week mark. Late-term abortions are rare. Nationally, according to the Guttmacher Institute, 1.5 percent of U.S. abortions in 2006 occurred at the 21st week or later. According to the most recent data available from the Texas Department of State Health Services, 13 out of 81,591 Texas abortions (about 0.02 percent) in 2008 occurred in the 25th week or later. When we asked Bohac's campaign officials for evidence that Annie's List supports third-trimester abortion "on demand," it referred us to his political consultant, Keats Norfleet. Norfleet told us that Annie's List only supports "pro-choice, progressive Democratic women candidates who favor late-term abortions." Norfleet sent us several news articles describing Annie's List as backing Democratic women candidates who are "pro-choice," though none explicitly mentions third-trimester or late-term abortions. We wondered if Annie's List had clearly stated its position on third-trimester abortions anywhere. The group's website says it wants to elect more women who are "pro-choice" and who favor "reproductive rights," without mention of third-trimester abortions. In an e-mail, Jones said Annie's List doesn't advocate specific stands on issues. "We don't advocate for late-term procedures 'on demand,' " Jones said. "We simply provide resources to progressive Democratic women candidates to help them get elected. And one of the many tenets of what we consider to be progressive is to be pro-choice." Generally, Jones said, the group backs Democratic women who "support things like funding for sexual assault and domestic violence prevention, fully funded public schools, clear air and water, access to quality health care, and a woman’s right to choose." As for a candidate's position on third-trimester abortions, Jones said: "If there was a bill in Texas to ban so-called partial-birth or late-term abortions, we wouldn't kick a woman off our list just because she supported it" as long as she also supported an exclusion for the health and safety of the woman. Jones told us that the group assumes that a candidate's "pro-choice" position means that she's aligned with the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade and subsequent case law. That ruling established a constitutional right to an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. According to a report issued this month by the Guttmacher Institute, the court held in Roe that "a woman’s right to an abortion is not absolute and that states could restrict or ban abortions after fetal viability, provided their policies meet certain requirements," including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to approve further restrictions. Texas has two laws restricting third-trimester abortions — one enacted in 1987 and the other in 2005. According to an Austin American-Statesman report, the 2005 law — attached as an amendment to a proposal maintaining the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, now the Texas Medical Board — made it so that serious risk "to a woman's mental and physical health would no longer be a reason for an abortion in the last few months of pregnancy. An abortion could still be performed to prevent her death, but otherwise could not be performed unless she is diagnosed with a significant likelihood of suffering imminent severe, irreversible brain damage or paralysis. In addition, a fetus' abnormalities, other than severe, irreversible brain damage, would no longer be an acceptable factor." Mindful that Annie's List is supportive of pro-choice Democratic women but doesn't spell out a position on third-trimester abortions, we looked at what "pro-choice" means to others who work on abortion-related issues. Nash called that "a toughie," adding that "sometimes organizations still support a legislator if they vote for a 'partial-birth' abortion ban but are otherwise supportive of abortion rights and work to increase access to family planning and other reproductive health services." Sara Cleveland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, told us that the group defines "pro-choice" as "the original vision of Roe v. Wade," under which "states are permitted to ban abortion in the third trimester as long as there are exceptions to the ban for cases of a woman’s life or health endangerment." But Joe Pojman, executive director of an anti-abortion group, Texas Alliance for Life, said he would define "pro-choice" based on the positions taken by groups that use the term to describe themselves. He used NARAL Pro-Choice Texas as an example, saying correctly that it opposed the 2005 third-trimester measure as well as parental consent requirements for minors seeking abortions. Pojman said Annie's List backs candidates who support "abortions rights without limits," singling out state Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, who voted against the 2005 amendment increasing restrictions on third-trimester abortions as well as the final version of the bill containing the ban. We took a closer look at the vote on that amendment, which passed 118-16. We determined that Reps. Alma Allen of Houston and Yvonne Gonzales Toureilles of Alice, both backed this year by Annie's List, voted for the amendment, while Rep. Veronica Gonzales of McAllen, also supported by the group, voted against the amendment. So how about truth, lies and honesty? It's true that Annie's List backs "pro-choice" Democratic women. And Bohac's politically potent statement rests on the assumption that "pro-choice" means "supports third-trimester abortion on demand." That's a premise that he fails to back up. Annie's List makes no bones about being comfortable with candidates who oppose further restrictions on late-term abortions. Then again, this year it’s backing two House candidates who voted for more limits. Honestly? Bohac's sweeping, unsupported statement is False.

pomt-13191	Says Gerald Daugherty advocated lowering the penalty for crimes like strangulation in domestic violence cases because "they just ‘throw more people into the’" jail "‘system."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/oct/24/david-holmes/david-holmes-says-gerald-daugherty-advocated-light/	The Democratic challenger in a Travis County commissioner race says incumbent Republican Gerald Daugherty has urged a reduction in penalties tied to strangulation attempts in domestic violence attacks. David Holmes, a mediator and former legislative aide seeking to represent Precinct 3 covering western parts of the county, said in an Oct. 17, 2016, Facebook post: "Strangulation family violence crimes have arisen as an issue in my campaign for county commissioner after my opponent advocated lowering the penalty for such crimes because," Holmes wrote, "they just, ‘throw more people into the system.’" For this fact check, we reviewed the original video from a May 26, 2016, work session where Daugherty made a statement about the county possibly asking state lawmakers to re-classify strangulation to a misdemeanor from a felony. Holmes didn’t provide nor did we find other indications of Daugherty otherwise exploring or pushing for the change. In his Facebook post, Holmes urged viewers to watch and share an accompanying video he made that shows Daugherty saying at the work session: "Now strangulation, you know, is a definition that throws more people into the system. I mean, and I don’t know whether, you know, we need to be at the Legislature going, ‘don’t put strangulation as a damn felony,’ I mean, you know, because, you know, that just raises the numbers." SOURCE: Video posted on Facebook by David Holmes, Oct. 17, 2016 (screenshot) We learned more about the context of Daugherty’s comments by watching the county’s posted video of the session. It shows Daugherty piping up after the commissioners court heard criminal justice officials describe factors behind a 13 percent, 299-person uptick in the county’s jail population from May 2014 to May 2016. Addressing the commissioners court, members of the county’s Jail Population Monitoring Group, consisting of county justice planning, criminal courts and pretrial service administrators, cited as factors increases in felony family violence charges as well as bookings of individuals with mental disabilities. Carsten Andresen, one of the administrators, told the commissioners court that an enhanced form had helped authorities build domestic violence cases--resulting in more felony charges since 2014. To our inquiry, Kelsey McKay, a Travis County prosecutor, said by phone the county in 2014 added questions to the Travis County Sheriff’s Office strangulation supplement form to improve evidence-gathering about suspected abusers. Before that, McKay advised, the 2009 Legislature revised Title 5, Chapter 22 of the state penal code to make it a third-degree felony rather than a Class A misdemeanor if a family member, household member or significant other of a victim is "recklessly impeding the normal breathing or circulation of the blood of the person by applying pressure to the person’s throat or neck or by blocking the person’s nose or mouth." About an hour and 10 minutes into the work session, Daugherty expressed frustration at the jail population statistics presented before asking the monitoring group about how the group is organized. In our transcript below, we’ve bolded the Daugherty comments noted by Holmes: "If you have a committee and you don’t have a chairman and you don’t have a charge - how often do you meet? "Once a month? Is there soon to be a report that comes back saying ‘here are the things we can absolutely do,’ because I think these stats are great, but they’re a frustrating thing for all of us. "I know y’all look at this and say, ‘These are ridiculous.’ We need two new courts, and we continue to throw money at things and if it’s not the Michael Morton thing coming at us, it’s the DNA thing coming at us, it’s the numbers, it’s the now strangulation, you know, is a definition that throws more people into the system. I mean, and I don’t know whether, you know, we need to be at the Legislature going, ‘Don’t put strangulation as a damn felony,’ I mean, you know, because, you know, that just raises the numbers." Daugherty went on to refer to the county’s justice planning manager, Kimberly Pierce, saying: "Y’all, I mean, what I’m interested in -- I’m fine to have this stuff, but I hate to have to try to look even somewhat knowledgeable about something when Kim has forgotten more about this mess than I’ll ever know in my life. I need somebody that can take charge of something and my goal is to do something about the costs that we have in this community." No other indications When we asked Daugherty if he’d advocated going to lawmakers to reduce the penalty for strangulation in instances of family or intimate partner violence, he said he did not. By phone, he said: "Some of these statistics happen where there’s a definition change. I will tell you, if you are strangling somebody, then, by God, that ought to be a felony. It should have been a felony forever." Days after we made our initial inquiry, Daugherty brought up strangulation during the Oct. 18 commissioners court meeting during discussion of a request from Travis County Criminal Courts for three new district courts, saying: "I’m not going to say anything about strangulation, because I had one of the judges come over to me and (say) ‘Gerald, the way you expressed yourself, it was kind of like you weren’t sympathetic to people that were getting strangled,’ and I said ‘that’s the furthest thing from what I meant,’ I mean, you know, I think strangulation should be a felony, I mean, if that’s what you’re doing to someone." In a follow-up phone call to Daugherty, he said he’d done nothing to further investigate lessening the penalty or sent any such communication to any county official to that effect. Sarah Eckhardt, the Democratic county judge who heads the commissioners court, declined to comment on whether Daugherty has advocated as Holmes said. Separately to our inquiry, Deece Eckstein, who coordinates the county’s intergovernmental relations, said reducing the strangulation penalty wasn’t part of the county’s agenda relating to the legislative session beginning in January 2017. "It’s not on the agenda and there has not been any formal" or informal "suggestion to put it on the agenda," Eckstein said by phone. We also followed up with Holmes, who didn’t offer other signs of Daugherty advocating the described change in law. "Because I understand the problem, you’d never hear me -- or likely anyone else on the court -- jump during a discussion to the idea that we might need to go to the Legislature to get the penalty lowered," Holmes said by email. Our ruling Holmes said Daugherty advocated lowering the penalty for crimes like strangulation in domestic violence cases because "they just ‘throw more people into the’" jail "‘system.’" Addressing staff members, Daugherty appeared to be seeking input on a variety of issues affecting the costs of operating the jail. Among the questions he raised was whether the county should argue for a lowering of the penalty for strangulation. Yet Daugherty didn’t advocate for that action either in his comment at the work session or in any statement or action since, far as we can tell. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11011	"Repealing the Affordable Care Act — and with it, Ohio’s Medicaid expansion — could cost Ohio more than 81,000 jobs, jeopardize nearly 1 million Ohioans’ health care coverage, and leave more than 220,000 Ohioans with mental illness or substance use disorders without insurance."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2018/jul/10/our-future-pac/ohio-governors-race-liberal-pac-exaggerates-impact/	A liberal super PAC says repealing the Affordable Care Act could lead to dire consequences for the health of Ohioans and hurt the economy. "Repealing the Affordable Care Act — and with it, Ohio’s Medicaid expansion — could cost Ohio more than 81,000 jobs, jeopardize nearly 1 million Ohioans’ health care coverage, and leave more than 220,000 Ohioans with mental illness or substance use disorders without insurance," claimed the For Our Future PAC on its Stop Mike DeWine website. For Our Future PAC, launched by California billionaire Tom Steyer and unions, is targeting Republicans including Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who is running for governor against Democrat Richard Cordray. DeWine unsuccessfully sued in an effort to overturn the health care law. Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to achieve a repeal. We found that the statements require more explanation about the impact of repealing the Affordable Care Act. 'Could cost Ohio more than 81,000 jobs' The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute published an analysis related to jobs and the Affordable Care Act in March 2017. At the time, the Republicans were pursuing the American Health Care Act, a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The bill never became law. The first thing to know about economist Josh Bivens’ analysis is that he didn’t predict layoffs but instead came up with a rough estimate of the potential drag on job growth if the repeal occurred. For Ohio, that number was 81,385 jobs. The For Our Future PAC’s website doesn’t take into account the caveats in the report which stated: "Given all of this uncertainty, we present our findings as a drag on potential job growth, rather than as clear predictions of ‘jobs lost.’" George Washington University experts came up with a lower estimate for job losses in Ohio by 2026 based on the House bill and a higher one for the Senate bill. However, other experts have expressed doubts that repeal would lead to such a high number of job growth losses or that it’s possible to put a precise prediction on job losses. Joe Antos, a health care expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said such analyses take "an extreme view that everything is going to collapse." Antos said if the Affordable Care Act were repealed, he would expect some initial reduction in employment in the health care sector but some increase in other sectors. "On balance, what happened to employment, I don’t know," he said. Antos said that the predictions about job losses by Democrats are similar to the predictions by Republicans in 2010 that the requirements for small firms to cover employees would create massive disruption, but that ultimately didn’t happen. (We have fact-checked several claims that the Affordable Care Act is a "jobs killer" and repeatedly found the evidence fell short.) Two experts on health care economics, Jean Abraham at the University of Minnesota and Anne Beeson Royalty at Indiana University, reviewed literature and concluded that the Affordable Care Act had minimal effect on employment, hours of work, and compensation. Repeal would 'jeopardize nearly 1 million Ohioans’ health care coverage' For Our Future pointed to analysis by the Urban Institute in 2017 that analyzed the implications of partial repeal through the budget reconciliation process, an approach considered by Congress at that time. The Urban Institute predicted that it would lead to an increase of the uninsured population in Ohio of 964,000. However, the Urban Institute has done a more recent analysis of full repeal and nationally found a smaller number for how many would be uninsured due to policy changes. It didn’t publish new estimates for the states; however, Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, said it would be lower than the 964,000 figure. There are about 1 million people in Ohio who are insured through the Affordable Care Act, including about 230,000 people through the marketplace and almost 700,000 as a result of expanded Medicaid. Repeal would 'leave more than 220,000 Ohioans with mental illness or substance use disorders without insurance' This part of the statement refers to research by Harvard health economics professor Richard Frank and New York University Dean Sherry Glied. They said in January 2017 that repealing the Affordable Care Act would have "stark effects on those with behavioral health illnesses." Nationwide, the researchers estimated that approximately 1.25 million people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage if the federal health care law was repealed. They found that repealing the health care law would particularly harm states hit hard by opioid deaths, including Ohio where 220,512 people with addiction or mental health disorders have coverage through the law’s marketplace or Medicaid expansion. Since there is no Obamacare replacement bill under serious consideration right now, it’s unknown whether all of these people would end up uninsured. Our ruling For Our Future Ohio PAC said "repealing the Affordable Care Act — and with it, Ohio’s Medicaid expansion — could cost Ohio more than 81,000 jobs, jeopardize nearly 1 million Ohioans’ health care coverage, and leave more than 220,000 Ohioans with mental illness or substance use disorders without insurance." The statement about jobs ignores the caveats in the study by the Economics Policy Institute. The study came up with a number about the potential drag on job growth under a scenario that was pushed by Republicans in 2017 but that never became law. It does not refer to job layoffs. About 1 million Ohioans are currently covered by the Affordable Care Act. An academic study found that about 220,000 Ohioans with addiction or mental health disorders have coverage through the law. However, since there isn’t a repeal-and-replace bill under serious consideration right now, it’s difficult to predict how many people in Ohio would be left without coverage.

pomt-12670	"Germany owes ... vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/19/donald-trump/fact-check-donald-trump-says-germany-owes-vast-sum/	Less than 24 hours after meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize Germany for shirking on its defense payments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United States. "Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel," Trump wrote in a tweet March 18. "Nevertheless, Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump has repeatedly called on NATO countries to contribute more to that military alliance, so we decided to fact-check his claim about Germany. What we found is that Trump is misunderstanding how NATO’s joint defense is paid for, and that Germany doesn’t owe anything. ‘Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO’ NATO, formally the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was created in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. Currently, 28 countries (including the United States and Germany) are members. The members agreed that "an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all" and that following such an attack, each member would take "such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force." We never heard back from Trump’s team about what money Germany owes. But Trump likely was alluding to the fact Germany has not yet met the NATO target commitment for overall defense funding. As of 2014, NATO’s collective agreement directed members to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending by 2024. According to NATO, only five counties meet that obligation today: the United States, Greece, Estonia, Poland and the United Kingdom. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com As you can see from the graphic above, Germany only pays 1.2 percent of their GDP on defense spending. German leaders have said they intend to boost military spending. The problem with Trump’s claim, however, is that Germany doesn’t pay that money to NATO or the United States or any other country, said Daniel Benjamin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "(Germany) has, like many members, fallen short of its commitments, which is obviously not good," Benjamin said. "But there is no central bank this money goes into, and there is no transaction." Other experts we consulted agreed. The United States decides what level of military spending it wants to have, as do all other NATO members. "The relatively low levels of military spending among U.S. allies is completely rational," said Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. "They don't see a pressing need to spend more." Trump’s argument that the United States needs to be paid more also misrepresents how NATO works, experts told us. "Trump seems to represent the NATO alliance as a licensing deal — one in which countries like Germany pay the United States for its power and influence," said Laicie Heeley, a military budget expert at the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank. "This is not the case." The United States does provide an outsized military commitment to NATO, but this is not done as a favor for Europe; it’s done to benefit all countries in the alliance, experts said. And the United States has several high-profile military bases in Germany that are vital, serving as a key launching point for attacks against terrorists in the Middle East. Our ruling Trump said Germany "owes vast sums of money to NATO" and the United States "must be paid more" for the defense it provides to Germany. NATO members agreed to spend 2 percent of their country’s GDP on defense by 2024. But that’s not in payments to NATO. Each country funds its own defense, while NATO serves as an umbrella organization meant to protect all members. Experts say Trump is mistaken. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09893	On a cap-and-trade plan.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/20/sarah-palin/palin-flips-her-support-cap-and-trade/	Shortly after announcing she would resign as Alaska's governor, Sarah Palin wrote an op-ed column in the Washington Post lambasting the cap-and-trade bill. "I am deeply concerned about President Obama's cap-and-trade energy plan, and I believe it is an enormous threat to our economy," she wrote on July 14, 2009. "It would undermine our recovery over the short term and would inflict permanent damage." She said jobs will be shipped overseas, energy sector workers will lose their jobs and electricity bills will skyrocket, echoing points that many other Republicans have used in arguing against the bill. "Do we want to outsource [work] to China, Russia and Saudi Arabia? Make no mistake: President Obama's plan will result in the latter. For so many reasons, we can't afford to kill responsible domestic energy production or clobber every American consumer with higher prices," she wrote. Did we mention her op-ed was called "The 'Cap and Tax' Dead End?" Clearly, Palin is no fan of cap-and-trade. Before we get to Palin's history on the issue, here's some background on cap-and-trade, a proposal to slow climate change. The bill Palin lambasts was authored by Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts. It would cap carbon emissions with the long-term goal of lowering them by 83 percent by 2050. In the meantime, companies would either have to buy permits from the government to continue polluting or trade them with companies who don't produce enough pollution to meet the government-imposed limit. Several readers wrote to us after the op-ed was published suggesting Palin had flip-flopped. We should note that this isn't the first time Palin's opinions on climate change have earned her a place on the Flip-O-Meter; in a Sept. 11, 2008, interview with Charles Gibson of Good Morning America , Palin insisted that she's always considered climate change a product of human activity, but we found she had made a Full Flop. As for her stand on cap and trade, it too has shifted. Before she became Sen. John McCain's presidential running mate, she did not endorse cap-and-trade outright. When she was named as a possible choice, a U.S. News and World Report column said she had no public position on the legislation but that she had shown signs of being interested in the concept. During her first few months as governor, Palin created a subcabinet on climate change — a group of advisers assigned to find ways to lower the state's greenhouse gas emissions. "The state's interest in curbing emissions represents a new emphasis for Palin, who pronounced herself unconvinced about global warming science during her campaign for governor last year," said an April 13, 2007 article in the Anchorage Daily News . Palin's interest in climate change back then may have had something to do with her state's location. Because of its high latitude, the arctic state has felt the impacts of climate change sooner than the rest of the world. More than a year later, the subcabinet announced that it would come up with a plan for major industries in the state — oil production, forestry, transportation — to try to reduce climate change. In the fall of 2007, Palin became involved with the Western Climate Initiative, a coalition of Western states and Canadian provinces with the goal of slowing climate change, according to her Web site. The group established a regional cap-and-trade program in September 2008, but Alaska does not have to meet those goals because it is designated in the group as an observer, not a partner. Palin became more direct about cap-and-trade when she teamed up with McCain, a Republican who famously went against his party in 2003 by introducing a cap-and-trade bill with then-Democrat Joe Lieberman. McCain stuck with his pledge to to lower emissions during the campaign, writing in the March 18, 2008, edition of the Financial Times that "the risks of global warming have no borders." Palin echoed McCain's platform in the Oct. 2, 2008 vice presidential debate against Joe Biden. (It's on YouTube . Skip to the 29-minute mark to hear her talk about climate change and cap-and-trade.) During the debate, Palin emphasized the importance of energy independence, of "cleaning up the planet" and of "encouraging other nations to come along with us." She went on to say, "We've got to reduce emissions." "We've got to become more energy independent for that reason also. ... As we rely on other countries that don't care as much about climate as we do, we're allowing them to produce, and to emit, and to pollute more than America would ever stand for." When debate host Gwen Ifill asked Palin whether she supported capping carbon emissions, her answer was unequivocal: "I do," she said. "I do." It's worth noting that Ifill did not ask Palin if she supported cap-and-trade specifically. But Palin's comments make it clear she at least supported the "cap" part. (Indeed, although the caps have generated most of the opposition, capping and trading are inextricably linked. If you cap emissions, you need a mechanism like the trading to provide incentives for companies to reduce their emissions.) Fast-foward to Palin's recent op-ed in the Washington Post and it's clear that she has done a dramatic reversal on the issue. She was in favor of capping emissions as McCain's running mate and is now writing op-eds blasting the idea. We see that as a Full Flop.

pomt-05722	Connie Mack's "only real job in the real world" was as "‘events coordinator’ for Hooters!"	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/mar/06/george-lemieux/george-lemieux-says-connie-mack-only-job-hooters/	An attack ad from George LeMieux links U.S. Rep. Connie Mack with Hooters, the home of big-busted gals in short shorts and tight T-shirts who serve up eye candy along with tasty chicken wings. The ad depicts Mack as a reckless party boy: "Connie the fourth took seven and a half-years to finish college. … Drunken Brawls. … Arrested. … Road rage. … His only real job in the real world? An ‘events coordinator’ for Hooters!" The ad shows a voluptuous woman sporting a cowboy hat as a grinning Mack dances around holding a "rent tent" sign. (See the ad here.) LeMieux and Mack are opponents in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, but LeMieux isn’t the first to holler about Mack’s Hooters’ experience. It’s been a common attack on Mack for more than a decade. But was LeMieux correct to claim that Mack’s job as an "events coordinator’’ for Hooters was Mack’s only "real job in the real world?" The Feb. 27th ad followed a Miami Herald article dissecting Mack’s past. PolitiFact Florida previously ruled on a separate claim in the ad, that Mack failed to pay his child support, rating it False. Mack’s jobs cited by his campaign Mack’s campaign website says he worked in the past as "a business executive with Fort Myers-based LTP Management before becoming an independent business and marketing consultant." Mack received his bachelor’s degree in 1993. He won a seat in the state House of Representatives, representing Broward and Palm Beach counties in 2000. He then moved to Lee County and won a seat in Congress in 2004. Mack campaign spokesman David James said that Mack was a marketing executive for LTP Management for about seven years, from 1994 to 2000. The company owned and operated several Hooters franchises in Florida, as well as Dan Marino's Town Tavern and Lulu's Bait Shack. LTP didn’t respond to our requests for an interview. Mack never received a paycheck directly from Hooters, but "we never denied he worked on behalf of Hooters," James said. James also objected to Mack being called an "events coordinator." He was actually a "marketing executive," James said. As evidence of other work experience, James said Mack built boats at Marine Concepts in Fort Myers while in high school. Mack also had a series of full-time traveling sales jobs before and after college graduation, including selling Nautilus exercise equipment and MEDX spinal rehab equipment. "Both were full time, salaried," James wrote. "Nautilus hired him before he finished his degree - but it was not a part-time gig. The spinal rehab equipment job with MEDX was full time. One followed the other." Mack also briefly had a sales job for Hilton Grand Vacations, he said. In the past, Mack has listed his work experience as LTP Management and his own marketing group, CM and Associates. Those were the only two jobs he listed on a 2002 Miami Herald editorial board questionnaire for the prior five years. We are limited in analyzing Mack’s private sector work history for a few reasons. For starters, much of it was before he was elected, which means that there was no requirement for him to document it for public review. Once he ran for office and was elected, documents we saw that asked him questions about his work -- such as the Herald’s editorial questionnaire or state disclosure forms about income in 1999 and in 2000 -- didn’t require that he provide details such as how much of his time was spent on Hooters-related assignments. And since Mack worked in marketing, unlike law, he may not have even had to document how much time he spent per restaurant for his own employer. LeMieux’s evidence LeMieux’s campaign said the Hooters claim in their ad came from the February Miami Herald story that stated that Mack worked for a "consultancy to promote Hooters" and a 2011 column in the Palm Beach Post which was written as a mock image makeover for Mack: "Issue No. 1: Work experience. "Problem: Before trading on the name of your father (a U.S. senator) to begin your current career as a full-time servant of the people in 2001, the most meaningful employment you had was as a ‘special events coordinator’ for a bunch of Hooters restaurants. Boiled down to its essence: You were the go-to guy for folks who wanted to have scantily clad waitresses appear at their events. "Solution: You will be effective in a Democratic-controlled Senate, because you already know what it's like being surrounded by a bunch of boobs." Our ruling LeMieux’s ad states "Congressman Connie Mack’s only real job in the real world? Events coordinator for Hooters!" It’s true that most of Mack's work experience in the private sector was with a company that owned and operated Hooters restaurants in Florida. This was the time soon after Mack's graduation from college and before his election to a full-time public office, a period of about seven years. But the company he worked for owned and operated other restaurants, including Dan Marino's Town Tavern and Lulu's Bait Shack. Mack's campaign said he was marketing executive, not an events coordinator, and also said that Mack had other sales experience prior to that. Meanwhile, the LeMieux campaign couldn't offer specific evidence that Mack's work experience was solely with the Hooters restaurants, which the ad calls "his only real job in the real world." One of the principles of the Truth-O-Meter is that campaigns have the facts to back up their claims. On this one, the LeMieux team largely comes up short. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly False.

That seems like very little from a budget that tops $600 billion for fiscal year 2016, so we decided to look into it. What we found is that while Sanders was talking primarily about money earmarked for fighting the group known as Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL), he’s not considering the true fungibility of the Defense Department’s budget. Deciphering defense Sanders’ campaign has used this talking point before, and shared the math with us. They cited more than $600 billion in defense spending, saying only $5.5 billion has gone to fighting ISIS and around $42 billion has gone to operations in Afghanistan, much of which is used to fight al-Qaida. In all, they said the government has spent about 7.9 percent of the defense budget on fighting terrorism. But experts told us that’s a very narrow view of how the defense budget works, which is the largest of any single country in the world by far. For fiscal year 2016, total defense spending clocked in at almost $607 billion overall in the spending bill Congress passed in December 2015. That includes all defense-related appropriations, including mandatory funding for retirement and pension payments and nuclear weapons spending at the Department of Energy. We’re concerned primarily with two parts of the Defense Department budget: Base discretionary spending and the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. Base discretionary funding is the biggest chunk of the budget. That’s all the money the U.S. military gets to buy planes and tanks, fund research, keep bases open and so forth. Laicie Heeley, a fellow with the Budgeting for Foreign Affairs and Defense program at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said the Defense Department’s base for 2016, minus other defense-related spending, is around $522.9 billion. That’s a $26.8 billion increase from last year, she said. But money for fighting wars comes from the so-called Overseas Contingency Operations fund, which was established after the Sept. 11 attacks. It currently includes funding for the air campaign against ISIS, but also maintaining a presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. Initiatives to assist with counterterrorism efforts in the Middle East and NATO allies in Europe concerned about Russian aggression also come out of the OCO. The fund is controversial, because Congress and the White House have squabbled over using the OCO to pay for things normally covered by base funding, in order to get around the effects of sequestration. For 2016, the fund received about $58.8 billion, but the budget deal put about $9.1 billion in the OCO for things normally covered under base funding. That leaves $49.7 billion earmarked for waging war abroad, but the details of how that money is used is a bit murky in the appropriations bill. A clear picture won’t be available until the Defense Department releases its 2017 budget request in February. In the meantime, Heeley said, we can use President Barack Obama’s 2016 defense budget request to get an idea of how the money is allotted. Obama asked Congress for $5.3 billion to fight ISIS (slated to grow in 2017) and $42.5 billion for Afghanistan, largely to help fight al-Qaida. Using these figures with the Sanders campaign’s rough math, ignoring the military presence in Iraq or other counterterrorism operations, that would be a bit more than 9 percent. But here’s the thing: Policy experts said it’s hard to draw a tidy line between how much of the defense budget is for current operations and how much is for general readiness. The military needs its base budget in order to conduct the fighting for which the OCO was created. "Capital investments in ships and planes are not included in OCO, yet you need them to launch Tomahawks and all other sorts of munitions," said Janine Davidson, senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Personnel and training also are not easy to parse. A C-17 could fly a mission around the world and only part of the week would be in support of (an) Afghanistan or ISIS fight." Sanders’ math also doesn’t take into account counterterrorism efforts through other sources that don’t involve bombs or fighter jets, like the Justice or State departments. For example, the FBI’s Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence Decision Unit spent about $3.3 billion in 2015, and asked for about the same amount in 2016. The CIA and the National Security Agency also work to thwart terrorism. While we don’t know to what degree those agencies are funded, documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden showed that in 2013, more than $16 billion was spent to combat terrorism. "Bernie is taking an extremely limited view of the defense budget here," Heeley said. "While it may be true that the counterterrorism budget as a whole deserves a closer look, and would benefit from more transparency, it is not true that we're spending significantly less than 10 percent overall to fight international terrorism." Our ruling Sanders said, "Very little of (the defense) budget — less than 10 percent — actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism." He’s getting that number by using a very limited view of the overall defense budget, pointing only to specific allotments in the budget for addressing ISIS and other terrorist threats. Experts told us that no matter what amounts are designated for that purpose, those operations draw from resources paid for in the base budget. There’s no clear way to separate the two. Sanders’ figure does refer to some specific funding but paints a misleading picture of overall defense spending. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08075	Those who fail to buy health insurance under "Obamacare" face the threat of jail time.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/20/bob-marshall/del-bob-marshall-says-violators-obama-health-care-/	Among the many conservatives celebrating U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson’s health care reform smackdown this week, perhaps no one was more joyous than Virginia Del. Bob Marshall, R-Prince William County. Marshall introduced the state legislation that opened the door for the ruling. Early this year, Marshall was the patron of HB 10, the Virginia Health Care Freedom Act, exempting state residents from the federal law. That bill set up Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli’s challenge to health care reform. On the day of Hudson’s ruling -- which found the provision requiring nearly every American to purchase insurance or face a penalty unconstitutional -- Marshall unleashed a fresh attack on the health care law. "The federal law compels American citizens to contract for health insurance they do not want, do not need, or find morally objectionable," Marshall wrote in a news release. "Persons who decline to buy the coverage face fines and imprisonment." Later in the release, Marshall reiterated his point: "The threat of heavy fines and jail time for failure to buy Obamacare health insurance is a power grab without practical limits and has no precedent in American history. It undermines our constitutional form of government, and is an affront to free men and women." Jail time? Really? We asked Marshall for a source, and he pointed to an exchange in the Senate Finance Committee between Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., and Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff Thomas Barthold on Sept. 24, 2009. After asking about the penalty for failing to pay the fine for not purchasing health insurance, Ensign received a handwritten note from Barthold confirming the penalty for failing to pay an up-to $1,900 fee for not buying health insurance. Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor and could face up to a year in jail or a $25,000 penalty, Barthold wrote. That was true -- then. But it took place well before the health care law was approved. Both House and Senate versions of the health care bill contained language that would levy a tax on persons who refuse to obtain coverage. Under the House version, evading that tax would have resulted in jail time; but not in the bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee and eventually made law. The health care bill signed by President Obama explicitly says there are no criminal penalties for those who do not obtain coverage and refuse to pay the penalty tax. As plainly stated on page 111 of the law, "In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty imposed by this section, such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty with respect to such failure." There would also be no liens or levies placed on property for failure to pay. Instead, the law would allow the government to collect the tax by deducting it from any IRS tax-refund checks or other government payments. Just to be certain we weren’t missing anything, we asked Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli’s office for their take on the issue. "The law does not send people to jail for not paying the fine," confirmed Brian Gottstein, Cuccinelli’s director of communication. So Marshall is flat out wrong on the jail time. His point that there are fines is correct. The individual mandate in the health reform bill imposes "taxes" that are designed to prod uninsured Americans to buy insurance. Exemptions would be provided for families of limited means. The idea is that by expanding the pool of Americans paying for coverage, insurers can use the additional revenue to improve benefits, eliminate barriers for pre-existing conditions and reduce costs for others enrolled in the plans. Those without coverage could eventually (by 2016) pay a tax penalty greater than $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5% of household income. The penalty will be phased-in. After 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment. Let’s recap. In his release, Marshall twice said people failing to purchase health care could face imprisonment. That’s not true. Marshall references an exchange that took place over a year ago, well before the law was approved. At that time, imprisonment was a possibility, but not in the legislation that was enacted. It is ridiculous for Marshall, no novice in public affairs, to insist otherwise. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.	None	Bob Marshall	None	None	None	2010-12-20T11:23:37	2010-12-13	['None']
pomt-04838	Voter turnout for some groups in the 2008 presidential general election in Georgia "was far greater than it should have been demographically."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/14/warren-kampf/lawmaker-uses-georgia-push-voter-id-law/	Politicians sometimes use other states to bolster themselves in policy debates. "Look, we’re not as bad as that state!" is typically how it goes. News quickly circulated to us through the Internet that a Pennsylvania lawmaker was talkin’ about Georgia. State Rep. Warren Kampf was making the case at a town hall meeting for his state to have identification laws similar to Georgia to prevent voter fraud at the polls. A court battle is under way in Pennsylvania on the legality of the state’s voter ID law. "Georgia has a very similar law. They’ve had it for six years. And they had it in 2008, and in those communities which often are said to have been impacted by voter ID laws, the turnout was actually far greater than it should have been demographically," Kampf, a Republican, said. The comments were initially reported on a Patch.com website in Pennsylvania, and then the Huffington Post. We wondered: Was voter turnout higher among some historically disadvantaged groups during Georgia’s 2008 election cycle? And, if so, is there some context to consider? This is not the first time someone has used Georgia as a case study on voter ID laws and their impact, or lack thereof, on the 2008 presidential election. The speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives said Georgia’s voter ID law did not dissuade blacks from voting and added it’s been helpful. PolitiFact Ohio said the claim wasn’t supported by research and rated it Half True. Kampf was apparently talking about black voters. A gentleman in Kampf’s office told us that the percentage of Georgians who are black who voted in 2008 was higher than past years. We asked him for more information to back up the representative’s claim, or to talk to Kampf himself. PolitiFact Georgia did not get a reply. A telephone message left at his office was not returned. In 2006, the Georgia Legislature passed a law requiring adults to produce a form of picture identification when voting in person to stop fraud. Acceptable forms of ID include a driver’s license, a U.S. passport, military photo and student ID from a state college. Some black politicians and officials have criticized Georgia’s voter ID law and similar laws in other states as attempts by Republicans to discourage some who typically vote for Democrats, particularly African-Americans, from voting. "We call those poll taxes," U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said during a recent speech to the NAACP in which he equated Texas' photo ID law to instances post-slavery in which blacks had to pay a tax or pass a test in order to vote. Nonsense, voter ID proponents say. In 2004, about 76 percent of black women and 66 percent of black men registered to vote in Georgia cast ballots in that year’s presidential election, according to data we found on the Georgia secretary of state’s website. In 2008, an estimated 80 percent of black women and 70 percent of black men registered to vote in Georgia voted in the November presidential election, the website shows. In 2004, black voters made up 25 percent of Georgia’s electorate, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. In 2008, according to exit polls, African-Americans cast 30 percent of all ballots in Georgia. Similar increases occurred among black voters nationwide. We quickly considered one clear difference between those two elections: Barack Obama. Most black voters were pretty excited about the prospects of the nation electing its first African-American president in 2008. Exit polls found Obama won 98 percent of Georgia’s black voters, the AJC reported. PolitiFact Georgia spoke to three political science professors with expertise on racial voting demographics. All three said Obama was a factor in the percentage of blacks who voted in Georgia. "2008 is not necessarily a good base year for anything because it’s such a special case," said Clark Atlanta University associate political science professor William Boone. Boone said he’s unaware of any data that examines how many people have been turned away from voting because they don’t have an acceptable form of identification. That’s another reason Boone said Kampf’s claim cannot be substantiated. University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said Obama’s presence on the 2008 ballot "undoubtedly" was a factor in turnout among black voters. Bullock contends that shows people can adjust to any local or state regulations in order to vote if they feel a particular race is important enough to them. The 2008 results, Bullock said, "suggest if you want to go out and vote, you’ll do that." Traditionally, Bullock noted, there are patterns based on education and income. Higher-educated people and the rich vote in higher percentages, he and others say. Emory University associate political science professor Andra Gillespie discussed that point with us. "The legislator in question here seems to think that because there was a spike in turnout in 2008, there are no barriers to turnout for any blacks," Gillespie said via email. "This is not the group ... about which advocates are concerned. They are worried about those who are poor, less educated, older, don't drive, don't use social services, or who live in inner cities or rural areas." We couldn’t find any data that examined whether low-income or lesser-educated black Georgians voted at a lesser clip between the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections. It’s correct that black voter turnout in Georgia did increase between the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, but the increase wasn’t, as Kampf said, "far greater." Also, the 2008 election was, as Boone said, a "special case." Kampf’s statement is accurate, but it needs some clarification and context. Our rating: Mostly True.

pomt-07550	Says Chris Abele, opponent in Milwaukee County executive race, "failed to finish 3 separate colleges, dropping out all 3 times."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/01/jeff-stone/jeff-stone-says-chris-abele-opponent-milwaukee-cou/	If philanthropist Chris Abele is elected April 5, 2011, he would become the second consecutive Milwaukee County executive without a college degree, following in Scott Walker’s footsteps. But did he drop out of college three times? His opponent, Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale), makes that claim in a campaign flier that hit mailboxes the last week of March. The flier recites a litany of newspaper stories that exposed issues from Abele’s past. We decided to zero in on the college degree one because questions remain about Abele’s academic career. Abele pointedly evaded questions about why he didn’t finish at Lawrence University during a high-profile campaign appearance March 17, 2011. So did Abele "drop out" three times? We asked Stone to explain. After all, his flier cites as support a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that only discusses Abele’s departure from Lawrence without a degree. Stone’s campaign manager, Vi Rowley Hammelman, pointed us to a 2005 Milwaukee Magazine profile that outlined the schools Abele had attended. She said it was fair to say Abele "dropped out" of three schools -- Lawrence, Bennington and Boston University -- because he didn’t finish at those schools and ultimately did not get enough credits to earn a degree. The basic information on Abele’s college days is incomplete. It’s not clear how many credits Abele earned in his college career, which his campaign says ended at Lawrence but spanned at least three institutions from 1986 to 1994. Abele campaign spokesman Brandon Lorenz said he did not know how many credits short Abele was when he left Lawrence in 1994. He said the campaign would not have time on short notice to find an academic transcript, and could not provide a résumé. "Chris doesn’t have a résumé," Lorenz said. "That’s why we can’t provide one to you." Let’s take a look, college by college. Abele started at private Bennington College in Vermont, attending for a year in 1986, according to Lorenz. The school does not release information on students without student permission. Lorenz said Abele moved on to Boston University, a private school. The university said it could not confirm or deny Abele attended there, unless he gives permission. The university has a Christopher Abele in its database, but he has asked that no information be released, an official in the registrar’s office said. Lorenz said Abele was not a full-time student there. But it’s unclear when and for how long. Lawrence officials told us Abele attended from 1991 to 1994, with the last semester abroad at a school in London. The release of information on credits earned would have to be authorized by Abele, the university’s registrar’s office said. In 2002, Abele was referred to as a Lawrence graduate in The Business Journal’s story on a move to Milwaukee of the Argosy Foundation, run by Abele’s family. Similarly, a 2002 online newsletter posted by a national nonprofit referred to Abele as a graduate, citing his bio. A 2003 Journal Sentinel profile of Abele said only that Abele "went to" Lawrence. Milwaukee Magazine reported in a Feb. 1, 2005, profile that the official biography Abele provided the magazine’s reporter said he graduated from Lawrence. That graduation claim was refuted by Lawrence officials in 2005, and they recently confirmed that for PolitiFact Wisconsin. In our review, we found no evidence Abele has continued to circulate an inaccurate biography. Lorenz, the Abele spokesman, didn’t dispute the "dropout" characterization in relation to Lawrence and Bennington. He mildly challenged the term in relation to Boston University, saying, "if you are not a full-time student I’m not sure how to characterize that as dropping out." Hammelman responded: "Tell him to prove" he went part time at BU. The Stone campaign did not consider Abele’s 1992 summer school courses in making its claim. Abele enrolled in two extension courses through Harvard University. Harvard officials said their records showed he did not complete the courses. We asked Abele’s campaign about Boston University and about his official bio. Regarding BU, Lorenz would say only that Abele was contemplating a major in music at the time. Regarding Abele’s biography, Lorenz provided a Feb. 15, 2005, letter to Milwaukee Magazine written on behalf of Abele by an Argosy Foundation official. The letter says Abele’s bio "is compiled and sent out by assistants in the office, not Chris. However, Chris takes fulI responsibility for any errors and sincerely apologizes to anyone who feels they've been misled or that he was being dishonest." Time for a final grade. Stone -- who officials at public Washburn University in Kansas say earned a bachelor’s degree in 1983 -- claims Abele "failed to finish" at three schools, "dropping out" each time. Abele does not dispute that he did not finish college, and confirms he attended the three schools Stone cites. His campaign takes issue with the "drop out" charge only in the context of Boston University. If we could determine that Abele entered Boston University intending to continue toward a degree, Stone’s claim would likely rate True. Since we’re looking at a Stone claim, the burden of proof is on him. Of course, it’s Abele who won’t provide the crucial details -- and the full context about his college history and background. That puts us -- barring new information -- at Mostly True.	None	Jeff Stone	None	None	None	2011-04-01T16:43:58	2011-04-01	['None']
pomt-05503	"In April 1997, there was a ‘gas out’ conducted nationwide in protest of gas prices. Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/15/facebook-posts/gas-out-boycott-1997-pushed-gasoline-prices-down-3/	Pump up the volume on your car radio. Pump up the air in your tires. Just don't pump any gas today, a Facebook post urges. A one-day gas boycott would remove billions of dollars from the pockets of oil companies "so please do not go to the gas station on April 15th and let's try to put a dent in the Middle Eastern oil industry for at least one day," the post says. Fifteen years ago, drivers held a successful boycott, according to the post. "In April 1997, there was a ‘gas out’ conducted nationwide in protest of gas prices. Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight," it says. The "gas out" claim has been circulating online for years. As prices at the pump tick up every spring the Internet buzzes with calls for a boycott: if it worked in 1997, why not now? Because it didn’t work then, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The Facebook post recycles material from chain e-mails. Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, called the claim "an outright myth/lie" and said there’s no evidence to support it. PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed news archives and found no mention of a boycott in 1997, except in more recent articles referring to the chain e-mails and posts on social networking sites. There were movements pushing national gas boycotts in 1999 and 2000. News reports and data show both efforts gained little support and gas prices had no major fluctuations at the time of the boycotts. That was also the case for gas prices in April 1997. Historical data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks the weekly national average for gasoline, shows costs varied by less than a penny. On April 7, 1997, a gallon of regular gasoline on average cost roughly $1.19. At the end of the month, the same gallon cost about $1.18. DeHaan said there’s little chance the federal data wouldn’t catch such a dramatic swing in prices and "odds are with such a huge percentage drop in prices in the late 90s, it would have been noticed." Also, he added, "if there was any single day ‘gas out,’ it would never have a direct impact such as what is suggested. Shifting demand from the gas out day to the day before or after results in zero change in gasoline demand and, therefore, has no impact on overall demand." Avery Ash, manager of regulatory affairs at the automotive club, AAA, said the premise of the one-day boycott "just doesn’t make economic sense." "It’s not ultimately going to have any impact on sales, on consumption," he said. So New Jerseyans will keep paying $3.79 for a gallon of regular-grade gasoline, the average according to AAA, and a one-day boycott won’t change that price. Our ruling With rising gas prices, calls for a one-day gas boycott are again making the rounds. A Facebook post promoting a "gas out" for April 15 said: "In April 1997, there was a ‘gas out’ conducted nationwide in protest of gas prices. Gasoline prices dropped 30 cents a gallon overnight." There’s no evidence and no data to support this claim. The average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline varied by less than a penny in April 1997. Stand back, readers.

pomt-05087	"Just in the past 10 years, college tuition has increased 28 percent."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/02/albio-sires/congressman-albio-sires-claims-college-tuition-has/	Pointing out how college tuition has increased over the last decade, U.S. Rep. Albio Sires recently called on his colleagues to stop a scheduled increase in interest rates for federally subsidized student loans. That increase would be "extremely burdensome" for students and families at a time when the cost of a college education has grown by nearly one-third in the last 10 years, Sires (D-13th Dist.) said June 20 in a speech on the House floor. "Just in the past 10 years, college tuition has increased 28 percent," Sires said. "Middle class families are struggling to send their sons and daughters to school. For many Americans, a college education is essential to future success." But PolitiFact New Jersey found that the increase in tuition and fees has been even higher than Sires claimed. Instead of 28 percent, those costs have jumped by about 72 percent at public four-year colleges and universities over the last decade, according to inflation-adjusted figures released by the College Board, the New York-based organization behind the SAT exam and many other higher education programs. Sires spokeswoman Erica Daughtrey told us the congressman meant to cite the increase over the past five years at public four-year institutions. During that timeframe, tuition and fees grew by roughly 28 percent at those colleges and universities, according to the College Board. Let’s break down the numbers. As compiled in the College Board’s "Trends in College Pricing" report, the estimates for tuition and fees are based on an annual survey of nearly 4,000 postsecondary institutions across the country. The figures represent average prices for one year of full-time enrollment. In the following cost estimates, charges reported by institutions with larger full-time enrollments are weighted more heavily than those with smaller enrollments. According to the report, after adjusting for inflation, the average tuition and fees for public four-year institutions in the 2011-12 school year was $8,244. That figure marks a roughly 72 percent increase over the $4,793 charged in the 2001-02 school year, the report states. The average tuition and fees at public two-year institutions grew by about 45 percent during the last decade, after adjusting for inflation, from $2,047 in the 2001-02 school year to $2,963 in the 2011-12 school year, the report states. The increase in tuition and fees during the last decade has not been as steep at private nonprofit, four-year institutions, according to inflation-adjusted figures in the report. In the 2011-12 school year, the average cost at those schools was $28,500, representing a nearly 29 percent increase over the $22,117 in tuition and fees for the 2001-02 school year. The College Board also notes that while tuition and fees have increased during the last decade, average family incomes at all income levels have dropped. "In addition, the assets many families have saved to pay for college have diminished in value," the college board said in the report. "In other words, rising tuition levels cause more problems because of the economic environment in which they are occurring." Our ruling While discussing a pending increase in interest rates for student loans, Sires said in a speech on the House floor: "Just in the past 10 years, college tuition has increased 28 percent." But according to the College Board, average tuition and fees at public four-year institutions increased by about 72 percent over the last decade. A spokeswoman for the congressman said Sires meant to cite the cost increase at those institutions over the past five years. So, Sires’ figure for the 10-year period is largely off, but his overall point about the rising cost of a college education is solid. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-14539	"There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating" both Supreme Court justices and Court of Appeals judges.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/14/marco-rubio/do-presidents-stop-nominating-judges-final-year/	The sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has sparked a heated discussion over his replacement, raising the stakes in an already contentious presidential election. Given the opposition of congressional Republicans, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida suggested on NBC’s Meet the Press that there’s no need for President Barack Obama to even try making a nomination. "But why not go through this process?" host Chuck Todd asked. "Because actually, it's not just for the Supreme Court, even for appellate courts, both parties have followed this precedent," Rubio responded. "There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating, or you stop the advice and consent process." Is it true that presidents "stop nominating" both Supreme Court and appellate court judges in their last year in office? We didn’t hear back from the Rubio campaign, but our research shows Rubio is overstating matters. Late-term SCOTUS picks Let’s first note that the scenario that Rubio is describing — a Supreme Court vacancy in the last year of a presidency — is pretty rare to begin with. Since 1900, it’s only happened once to a "lame duck" president, and twice more to presidents who lost re-election bids. All three times, the exiting president made nominations: • 1968: President Lyndon Johnson — who announced he would not run for re-election — nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas as Chief Justice and Homer Thornberry to fill Fortas’ vacancy. Fortas’ nomination failed, Thornberry withdrew his nomination and Chief Justice Earl Warren remained on the bench, delaying his retirement. (More on this later.) • 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo. Hoover lost to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. • 1912: President William Taft successfully nominated Mahlon Pitney to the Supreme Court. Taft lost to Woodrow Wilson. Three other presidents made successful Supreme Court nominations while running for re-election, but unlike Taft and Hoover, they won another term: • 1956: Dwight Eisenhower made a recess appointment of William Brennan. • 1940: Franklin Delano Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy. • 1916: Woodrow Wilson nominated John Clarke and Louis Brandeis. Late-term lower court picks When it comes to the lower courts, Rubio is on even less firm ground, experts told us. "He’s clearly wrong," said Russell Wheeler, a judicial expert with the Brookings Institution. Here’s a breakdown of the most recent examples of lower court nominations made in the last year of a presidency, courtesy of Wheeler: District Court nominations Court of Appeals nominations 2016 (Barack Obama) 4 4 2008 (George W. Bush) 26 6 2000 (Bill Clinton) 37 9 1988 (Ronald Reagan) 26 7 Confusion over judicial confirmations in the election years stems from the "myth of the so-called ‘Thurmond Rule,’ " said Wheeler. Named for former Sen. Strom Thurmond, who opposed Johnson’s 1968 Supreme Court nominations, the informal rule suggests that judicial nominations shouldn’t be confirmed in the months leading up to a president election. Though Wheeler and all the other experts we spoke with agreed that it becomes increasingly difficult to push through a nominee as the end of a presidency nears, the Thurmond Rule doesn’t actually hold up. For example, George W. Bush forwarded nominees to the Court of Appeals "as late as September of his last year in office," said Lisa Holmes, a University of Vermont professor who specializes in judicial politics. And that month, the Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee "shepherded through" many of Bush’s nominations even though "it did look very promising for President Obama" at the time, said Sheldon Goldman, a University of Massachusetts at Amherst professor who specializes in the politics of judicial selection. The evidence against Rubio’s claim also multiplies if we expand the criteria to beyond lame-duck presidents. From 1947 to 2014, there have been 79 appellate court nominations and 416 District Court nominations in presidential election years, according to Sarah Binder, a George Washington University professor who studies the federal judiciary. In fact, there’s an example sitting on the Supreme Court right now that contradicts Rubio, pointed out Goldman. Justice Stephen Breyer was nominated by Jimmy Carter to the Court of Appeals in November of 1980, after Ronald Reagan won the White House. Our ruling Rubio said, "There comes a point in the last year of the president, especially in their second term, where you stop nominating" both Supreme Court justices and Court of Appeals judges. Rubio suggested that point is now. The chance for an outgoing president to make a Supreme Court nomination in his last year in office has only happened once in the past century, in 1968. But presidents do continue to nominate appellate judges in their final year. Out of the last four presidents who served two terms, all of them made nominations to the Court of Appeals (as well as the District Courts) in their last year. We rate Rubio’s claim False. Correction: Ronald Reagan's final full year in office was 1988. An earlier version of this fact-check listed the incorrect year.

pomt-06552	Says David Dewhurst skipped nine candidate forums after announcing his U.S. Senate candidacy.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/03/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-david-dewhurst-ducked-nine-us-senate/	In an online video ad, U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz likens Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst to the mythical chupacabra, saying his opponent -- the Republican frontrunner for the seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison after 2012 -- isn’t engaging with his opponents. Specifically, the narrator says: "Since he entered the race on July 21, Dewhurst has skipped nine candidate forums." Nine skips in nine forums? Cruz’s campaign passed us a list of nine Senate candidate forums that took place from July 21 through Sept. 15, 2011, with contact information for each event’s organizer. And in telephone interviews, forum organizers confirmed to us that Dewhurst did not appear at the gatherings. The Cruz campaign did not list an Aug. 28 event near Sugar Land, organized on behalf of U.S. Rep. Pete Olson, R-Houston; both the Dewhurst and Olson campaigns confirmed that the lieutenant governor and other GOP Senate candidates attended and were given five minutes each to speak. Thus, out of 10 forums between July 21 and Sept. 15, Dewhurst did not appear at nine. But is not showing up the same as skipping? We wondered. The organizers of seven forums told us Dewhurst’s campaign told them beforehand that Dewhurst would not participate. Exceptions: Marc Moffitt of the Denton County Republican Party said Dewhurst’s camp said he couldn’t come until after he declared his candidacy and then he announced his candidacy the same July night as the party’s forum, meaning he wasn’t even a candidate until then. And Toby Walker of the Waco Tea Party said she never heard from Dewhurst’s camp about her invitations to its Aug. 13, 2011, event. Walker said: "It’s almost worse never to get a response. It’s like you’re not worthy." Among other forum organizers, Dean Wright, who steered the July 30, 2011, Austin Tea Party forum, said the group set out a chair for Dewhurst in case he changed his mind. Robert "Gonzo" Gonzalez, overseeing an August forum for the Clear Lake Tea Party, said Dewhurst’s camp told him it was "early in the campaign (to attend); I accepted that." Capy Alexander of the Republican Women of Kerr County said Dewhurst’s camp sounded interested in its Aug. 19, 2011, event, but "as it turns out, he was unable to come. I don’t know why." Most of the nine organizers told us they did not view Dewhurst’s non-attendance as "skipping." Maria Acosta of the Central Texas 9-12 Project said she would better describe its Aug. 20, 2011, gathering as a "lost opportunity." However, Katrina Pierson of the Garland Tea Party said that even though Dewhurst’s campaign said before its Sept. 15, 2011, event that Dewhurst had a prior commitment, she still views him as skipping out because the group initially told him about its plans in May. The Dewhurst campaign responded by stating that Dewhurst was acting governor on six of the nine event dates listed by Cruz and had a previously scheduled Republican event on another. Dewhurst himself, after he held an Austin town hall event Oct. 3, told us, "There is a whole other dynamic that folks are forgetting. Every week now for six weeks in a row, and maybe for another 13, 14 or 15 months, I’m the acting governor. ... I’m having a hard enough time just to go out and do some of our campaign events when we have both paperwork, responsibilities -- when we had the Bastrop (wild)fire, I was over there almost the whole week, totally consumed by it. So state business for me comes first." Of the candidate forums, Dewhurst said: "Quite frankly, I’m interested in getting our message out to the people, not necessarily spending a disproportional amount of time (with) the candidates talking to each other. … What I think is in the voters’ best interest is to hear from the candidates, and so that’s what we’re doing. We’re going to almost a different city every day." Looking forward, he said, that "as we can, we’re going to go to a forum or so every month." This month, he said, he plans to appear at an Oct. 21 candidate forum hosted by the Spirit of Freedom Republican Women PAC in Sugar Land. Our take: Dewhurst did not appear at nine forums, eight of them after the night he announced his candidacy. But it’s a mite questionable to say he outright skipped the events. In most cases, his campaign said beforehand Dewhurst wasn’t going to appear. We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2011-10-03T16:26:44	2011-09-21	['United_States']
pomt-10744	"There was a report that came out from the FBI – a warning, not a report ... saying that, in fact, al-Qaida was planning to attack malls during the Christmas holidays."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/05/tom-tancredo/tis-the-season-to-make-a-point-&ndash-frightfully/	Tom Tancredo has released a television ad for his presidential campaign that is getting as much attention for its fright factor as for its message that his opponents are soft on border security. Tancredo, a longtime advocate of increased border security to stem the flow of illegal immigrants, is now making the case in this ad that porous borders are a terrorist threat, too. The ad closes with the image of an abandoned backpack in a bustling shopping center and the sound of an explosion. After the ad was released, Tancredo defended it on CNN with this statement: "Well, about four days ago, I think, there was a report that came out from the FBI – a warning, not a report – that came out from the FBI, went out to all local law enforcement agencies, saying that, in fact, al-Qaida was planning to attack malls during the Christmas holidays. They specifically cited Chicago and Los Angeles as being the places where these attacks were potentially to occur. They said that it was a credible source." Tancredo is correct that the FBI considers the source of this information "credible," but as for the threat itself, not so much. "There's absolutely no information to indicate this is a credible threat," says Tom Simon, FBI special agent in Chicago. "Our source gave us this information with the full disclosure that this is third-hand information." "Every year since Sept. 11, 2001," says Simon, "we've had some kind of vague inkling of something, some chatter that something bad is going to happen come Christmastime in America. Nothing has so far. The important thing is this was never intended to be something that was going to scare the heck out of every American and keep them out of the malls. If we had specific information that Americans were in danger by going to the mall, we'd release that to the public." Simon goes on to say, "This was something that was released to the law enforcement community out of an abundance of caution." Tancredo's spokesman, Alan Moore, cited the sources for Tancredo's statement as briefings that the congressman receives and National Intelligence Estimates, as well as an FBI and Chicago Police Department news conference that addressed the leak to the media. Tancredo is correct that Chicago and Los Angeles were cited in the November report. And he is correct that the report went to all law enforcement agencies. But the wording of his statement gives an urgency to the FBI report that the FBI itself doesn't. Officially, the document sent out to law enforcement is called the Interim Intelligence Report, as opposed to "warning." Simon doesn't quibble with Tancredo's use of the term, but says it should also be stated "that the warning was unsubstantiated and very nonspecific." Yes, al-Qaida has made its horrifying intentions clear, but this FBI alert, meant only for the eyes of local law enforcement, was not vetted or verified and was one of thousands (8,000 were issued in 2006) of such reports that are meant to help the FBI's law enforcement partners intelligently provide security and peace for all 12 months of the year. "There was no law enforcement purpose in getting everyone screwed into the ceiling, screwing up the economy and causing panic," says Simon. "But it did make sense for us to notify our colleagues. Local law enforcement knows best how to patrol their communities." Tancredo is generally accurate in his statement, but in two places he overstates his case to serve a political point. First, he calls the FBI report a "warning, not a report," which suggests a distinction that the FBI doesn't acknowledge. Second, although he correctly notes that the source of this information is credible, he doesn't say the information itself isn't. Therefore, we find his statement Half True.

pomt-02841	"Nearly 20% of our residents" are born abroad.	true	/texas/statements/2013/nov/20/city-austin/20-austinites-foreign-born-mostly-mexico-asian-nat/	"Austin is truly an international city. Nearly 20 percent of our residents are born overseas," an Austin city official, Natalie Betts, said in a Nov. 8, 2013, press release about an orientation session in Austin’s International Welcome Program. That sparked our curiosity. City demographer Ryan Robinson told us by phone that according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey analysis covering 2007-11, about 19.3 percent of Austin’s residents were born in foreign countries. Census spokeswoman Virginia Hyer told us by phone that the bureau most recently published results of a survey covering 2010-12, which similarly indicated that about 19 percent of Austinites were born abroad. Hyer said, though, that the five-year survey released Dec. 6, 2012, remained a good source for data on small groups such as foreign-born populations because of its larger sample size. Specifically, according to data from the five-year analysis that city spokeswoman Melissa Alvarado emailed to us, 150,565 of the city’s 782,149 residents were born abroad. (Not included: the 11,548 Austinites born in Puerto Rico and U.S. Island areas or born abroad to American parents, who were classified as "native.") That makes the Live Music Capital of the World more cosmopolitan than the U.S. in general (13 percent foreign-born) or Texas (16 percent), according to other 2007-11 survey data Robinson emailed us. Austin also edged San Antonio (14 percent) and Fort Worth (17 percent). However, it had fewer residents born abroad than Dallas (25 percent) and Houston (28 percent). Robinson said the increase in Austin’s share of foreign-born residents is a long-term trend, rising from "maybe 16.5 percent in 2000" and less in 1990. "We’ve long had an international community, and it’s very much been tied to the University of Texas. That’s huge," he said. Only 23 percent of Austin’s foreign-born residents were U.S. citizens, according to the survey. That doesn’t mean the rest are here illegally, though; the survey did not ask about legal immigration status. In case you’re curious: The 2007-11 survey also showed that 53 percent of Austinites were born in Texas. Among Austinites born abroad, the survey found, the largest contingents came from Latin America (66 percent of the foreign-born population), Asia (24 percent) and Europe (6 percent). 2007-2011 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates: State demographer Lloyd Potter told us by phone, "That’s true for most all of Texas, that the bulk of our immigrants are from Latin American countries. Mexico is without question the biggest sender." In fact, about one-tenth of all Austinites were born in Mexico, we found in expanded results from the 2007-11 survey. Mexico accounts for more than half the city’s foreign-born population -- 54 percent. Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Cuba each account for 1 percent to 3 percent of those born abroad. Note: The city press release said "overseas," and clearly not all such residents had to cross an ocean to get here, but PolitiFact has equated "overseas" with "outside the U.S." in numerous past fact-checks. Potter and Robinson each said the percentage of Austinites hailing from Asian nations is noteworthy. In general, Asians are the city’s fastest-growing demographic group, according to an Oct. 23, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story -- surging by 60 percent in the past decade, triple the rate of the city’s overall growth. Of Austin’s foreign-born residents, the five-year survey shows 6 percent were born in India, 4 percent each in China and in Vietnam, and 3 percent in Korea. Potter said high-tech companies in the Austin area draw a high percentage of Asian immigrants seeking higher education or already possessing such an education and in-demand skills; employers then help them get visas. Overall, they tend to have high income and low levels of unemployment, he said. In the longer-established Latin American migrant stream, Potter said, immigrants are more likely to be joining relatives under a "family preference" visa, a type that does not require them to have a job in hand. Broadly speaking, Potter said, the group tends to exhibit higher unemployment, lower education and lower income levels. In September 2013, Austin opened an Asian American Resource Center, a 16,000-square-foot community center built in part with $5 million in voter-approved bonds. That center housed the Nov. 9, 2013, "Welcome to Austin" orientation advertised in the city’s press release. Betts, the city’s global business recruitment and expansion coordinator, told us by email the session included Korean and Mandarin translation. "We looked at which languages are spoken by the largest numbers of recent immigrants," she said. The first two sessions were in English and Spanish. Participants are briefed on public transportation, schools, health care and city resources such as police, libraries and parks, according to the press release; they also are offered information on starting a small business and on managing finances. What does having one-fifth of its populace born abroad mean for Austin? Robinson said it indicates Austin is increasingly tied to the global economy, for better or worse. And, he said, "It’s a piece of evidence that supports the narrative that Austin is indeed becoming much more of an international city than it ever was in the past." Our ruling A City of Austin official said, "Nearly 20 percent of our residents" are born abroad. Such residents made up 19.3 percent of the city’s population in the 2007-11 period covered by a federal survey. We rate the statement as True.

pomt-13286	Says Paul Ryan "is still endorsing Trump."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/11/hillary-clinton/after-donald-trumps-campaign-missteps-does-paul-ry/	One of the most vexing quandaries for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan in 2016 has been whether, and how, to support the GOP’s presidential nominee. Finally, a month from election day, Ryan somewhat reluctantly agreed to make his first public appearance with Donald Trump, at a political rally in his southern Wisconsin district. But on the day before rally, a videotape of Trump talking crassly about women surfaced. In the 2005 video, Trump is caught on a live microphone saying "I did try and f--- her. She was married." He also uses graphic terms to describe the woman’s body and says he frequently tries to kiss beautiful women and even grab their genitals. Ryan denounced Trump and said Trump would not be attending the rally. Three days after the video’s release, on Oct. 10, 2016, Ryan went further, declaring to fellow Republican House members he would not defend Trump, and instead focus on maintaining the GOP’s majority in the House. So, we wondered about a tweet issued the same day by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. She claimed: "Ryan is still endorsing Trump." Ryan’s position Ryan’s dilemma on supporting Trump was evident in May 2016, when we tested him on our Flip-O-Meter, which is used to see whether a politician has changed positions. We gave Ryan a Half Flip. At the time, just after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee with a win in Indiana’s primary, Ryan had said repeatedly he would support for president whomever won the Republican nomination. He said so even when asked specifically about Trump. Yet in his first comments after Trump won in Indiana, Ryan wavered. He did not say he would not support Trump. But he stated he was not ready to support him at that time. Then in June 2016, a month before Trump won the nomination, Ryan endorsed him, saying: "It's no secret that he and I have our differences. I won't pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I'll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement." Clinton’s claim Early on Oct. 10, 2016, Politico reported that, according to sources, Ryan was discussing whether to revoke his Trump endorsement. Clinton sent her tweet several hours later, after Ryan held a private conference call with House Republicans that was later discussed publicly. Clinton’s campaign cited to us a same-day blog post from the Los Angeles Times about the call. The post was headlined: "House Speaker Paul Ryan will not campaign with Trump, but still endorses him." Other news accounts on the conference call were similar. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated Ryan "stopped short of rescinding his own tepid endorsement of Trump," and quoted a Ryan aide as saying there is "no update" in his position on Trump "at this time." The New York Times and ABC News said Ryan responded to criticism for not supporting Trump more by emphasizing that he wasn't withdrawing his endorsement. As for Ryan himself, when we asked his campaign about Clinton’s claim, a spokesman simply reiterated what had been put out earlier, saying: "There is no update in his position at this time." Our rating Clinton says Ryan "is still endorsing Trump." As of the time when Clinton made the claim, Ryan’s endorsement of Trump for president remained in place.

pomt-04678	"Jeb Bush recently noted, Reagan himself would have been too moderate, too reasonable for today's GOP."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/06/charlie-crist/crist-jeb-bush-ronald-reagan-moderate-gop/	In his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Republican-turned-independent Charlie Crist said he didn’t leave the GOP, the GOP left him. He then evoked two Republican icons to drive home his point. "Half a century ago, Ronald Reagan, the man whose optimism was inspiring to me to enter politics, he famously said at one time that he did not leave the Democratic Party; but the party left him," Crist said. "Listen, I can relate. I didn't leave the Republican Party; it left me. Then again, my friend Jeb Bush recently noted Reagan himself would have been too moderate, too reasonable for today's GOP." Did Crist characterize Bush’s comments accurately? Bush made his comments on June 11, 2012, to national reporters and editors at a roundtable discussion hosted by Bloomberg View in Manhattan. Bush had already earned a reputation for being a respected member of the GOP who was willing to stray from the party line on immigration and raise taxes to reduce the deficit. At the breakfast, he called the current political environment "disturbing" and unsuitable for compromise thanks to both parties. He talked about the governing styles of his father, George H.W. Bush, and Reagan. According to the Bloomberg report, he said, "They got a lot of things done with bipartisan support, but right now it’s just difficult to imagine. "Context changes; history changes. Ronald Reagan would have, based on his record of finding accommodation, finding some degree of common ground, similar to my dad, they would have a hard time if you define the Republican Party -- and I don’t -- as having an orthodoxy that doesn’t allow for disagreement," he said. "We’re in a political system in general that is in a very different place right now." The quote was picked up by many news outlets and shorthanded much the same way Crist did in his speech at the DNC. BuzzFeed: Jeb Bush: No Place For Father, Reagan In Today's GOP Rachel Maddow’s blog: Jeb Bush: Reagan would have struggled with today's GOP Bush was displeased with the tone of the coverage. He took to his Twitter account the next day and punched out the following four tweets in effort to clarify his remarks: Am reminded today why I rarely read headlines. #ContextIsImportant The point I was making yesterday is this: The political system today is hyperpartisan. Both sides are at fault. My dad & Reagan sacrificed political points for good public policy. Past 4 years, Democrats have held leadership roles w/opportunities to reach across political aisle. For sake of politics, they haven't. Then Bush gave an email interview to the Associated Press, stressing that he meant both parties are overly partisan. Crist’s speech misinterpreted -- as many news organizations did -- what Bush meant, said Jaryn Emhof, a Bush spokeswoman. She held up the AP’s next-day story as an example of "one of the few who got it right." Our ruling We think it’s clear Bush said the partisan divide would make it difficult for Reagan to govern the way he did (i.e., Republicans might have been mad at him for working with Democrats, and Democrats might be unwilling to work with him because he’s a Republican.) What’s murky is whether Bush said -- or suggested -- Reagan would be "too moderate" and "too reasonable for today's GOP." We do know that Bush has since distanced himself from the suggestion that Reagan could not survive in today’s Republican Party. In this case, we think it’s fair to dock Crist points for cherry-picking one interpretation of Bush’s statement and for failing to factor in Bush’s subsequent remarks. On balance, we rate this statement Half True. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election. See video fact-checks here.

pomt-04747	Wealthy taxpayers, not middle-income earners, get "most of the deductions" in the tax code.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/29/paul-ryan/ryan-says-wealthy-taxpayers-get-most-deductions-ta/	Paul Ryan pushed back against Democratic claims that the middle class would see a tax increase under Mitt Romney’s proposals, saying the reality of the tax code doesn’t square with that. Ryan fielded questions about the tax plan in a Fox News interview as he headed to the Republican National Convention in Tampa. "The people who get most of the deductions are the people in the top tax brackets, the wealthy, not middle-income taxpayers," Ryan explained. "And so what we’re saying is by getting rid of these deductions that higher income earners get, more of their income is subject to taxation, and that means we can lower tax rates for everybody." The question of whose ox gets gored is front and center every time tax reform is considered, of course. Was the vice presidential nominee correct that top earners get most of the breaks in the current income tax code? Three tax experts told us that tax preferences are indeed tilted heavily to the rich, though how you define "rich" makes a difference. The most detailed report we found on how much households save because of tax preferences came from the Tax Policy Center in September 2011. It shows that the top fifth of earners get two-thirds of the total pie of savings from individual income tax breaks, including preferential rates on itemized deductions such as home mortgage interest and lower capital gains tax rates. The study uses 2011 income data. The top 5 percent alone get 41 percent of the total tax savings associated with these breaks, the study found. The "middle" 60 percent of earners, by contrast, get less than a third of the benefit, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The effect is even more pronounced if just the major itemized deductions are eliminated, but other breaks are kept, Williams said. It makes sense, Williams said. Lower earners have lower tax rates, so they get less benefit from the breaks than wealthier people who have more to deduct and pay higher tax rates. "They do benefit disproportionately," he said. Daniel Mitchell, a Cato Institute senior fellow who studies tax reform, said the state and local tax deduction and charitable contributions deduction are "very heavily tilted to the rich." He added: "The mortgage interest deduction is tilted to the rich as well, but not as dramatically." We should note that Romney’s tax reform plan does not call for dumping all tax deductions. He has said that if some deductions were eliminated, overall rates could be lowered. While he’s provided some specifics, the fate of many deductions is left unclear. As always in tax matters, there are some nuances here. In sheer numbers, some tax deductions such as the mortgage interest deduction are claimed by far more middle- and lower-income people than by people in the top brackets, IRS data shows. That’s in part a reflection of how broad the middle class is compared to the upper-income tiers. Tax savings from various preferences are spread throughout the population, from tax credits for low-income people to investment tax breaks for the wealthy, Williams noted. Ryan’s campaign cited IRS data showing greater benefits as you rise through the tax brackets, and that’s confirmed in the Tax Policy Center analysis, we found. Our third expert, William McBride, chief economist for the Tax Foundation, said judging Ryan’s statement "depends on the definition of rich." Ryan gave a clue - people in the "top brackets." But in 2011 there were six income tax brackets ranging from 10 percent to 35 percent, and drawing the line between the middle class and "wealthy" is a subjective call. The big benefits for the top fifth of earners, as found by the Tax Policy Center, are in a group whose incomes start at $103,000. Is that "wealthy?" What if, like President Barack Obama, you set $250,000 and up as a benchmark for raising tax rates for the "wealthy?" People in that group got less than 40 percent of the tax savings -- a figure that is somewhat at odds with the "most" description used by Ryan. Still, our experts said that, overall, it’s clear the benefits are tilted heavily to the upper end of the income scale. One more example: Just 0.1 percent of earners alone got 13 percent of the benefits, the Tax Policy Center study found. Our ruling Ryan, countering criticism of Romney tax plan, said that wealthy taxpayers, not middle-income earners, get "most of the deductions" in the tax code. He’s on target, with the caveat that it partly depends on the definition of "wealthy." Wealthier people pay higher tax rates and tend to get more benefit from deductions than lower-income earners. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-08-29T16:13:50	2012-08-27	['None']
pomt-02894	Says Kay Hagan "supports waivers for friends of Obama and special treatment for Congress and their staffs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/07/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-says-sen-kay-hagan-supports-o/	President Barack Obama’s health care law is bound to be a central issue of the 2014 midterm elections. In North Carolina, first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, is already facing attacks about Obamacare. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group, released an ad against Hagan. It starts out with a series of claims praising women for being breadwinners and job creators. Then, it pivots: "But Kay Hagan just doesn’t get it." "Hagan supports waivers for friends of Obama and special treatment for Congress and their staffs," the video continues. Hagan did vote to pass Obamacare in 2010, but does the law include "waivers for friends of Obama" and "special treatment for Congress and their staffs"? We’ll look into both parts of this statement. Waivers We’ve already fact-checked the claim that the president handed out waivers to his friends. The law did lead to the granting of more than 1,000 waivers, but they weren’t issued to groups on the basis of being Obama’s friends or political allies. Part of the law allowed for groups to apply for an exemption so that they can keep their cheap insurance plans, even though they don’t typically cover the "10 essential benefits" like maternity care and mental health care that Obamacare touts. These waivers expire on Jan. 1, 2014. Some but not all of these groups could be considered Obama’s political allies, so using the term "friends" is at the very least misleading. Many unions, which typically lean Democratic, made the list. They make up about a third of the waivers. But the recipients also include groups like the Baptist Retirement Homes of North Carolina, Pepsi and McDonald’s. The common denominator with most of those who received waivers seems to be low-wage workers. As far as we can tell, there’s no reason to think that "friendship" played a role, or that these companies are Obama’s political allies. More than 100 groups, including several unions, were denied waivers. There’s also a sizable number of groups that were denied waivers, then were accepted the second time around. Health and Human Services issues these waivers. Hagan and other legislators don't have a say. Hagan's spokeswoman told us the senator has never spoken out in favor of the practice. Special treatment for Congress PolitiFact has also looked at claims similar to Americans For Prosperity’s assertion that Congress gets "special treatment." That implies that legislators and their staffs aren’t subject to the health care reform’s individual mandate when in fact they are. It’s more accurate to say that Congress is one of several special cases under the law. However, this exception actually requires Congress to buy insurance on the marketplace instead of keeping employer-provided benefits from the federal government. Lawmakers still get a subsidy toward their policies. Without the subsidy, the change in coverage would have effectively been a pay cut of thousands of dollars per year. In other words, the law singles out Congress and forces members off their employer-provided plan in favor of the marketplace options, even though all other Americans with employee-provided health coverage can keep it. In defense of the ad, Americans for Prosperity wrote, "The ‘subsidy’ is not the problem. … Congress and its staff are enjoying an option not available to the rest of the nation." They cite the fact that businesses with more than 50 employees can’t yet access group plans on the Small Business Health Options Program, the marketplace the legislators will use. But this policy allows legislators to experience Obamacare's individual mandate alongside their constituents. We don't see a case that they're getting special treatment. Our ruling More than 1,000 companies have received Obamacare waivers, but there’s no evidence to suggest that those groups are all Obama’s "friends." Meanwhile, Congress and their staffs do have to adhere to the reform’s individual mandate, and in a key way are treated worse than other Americans by the law, which is a curious definition of "special treatment."

pomt-03045	"This year, the federal government will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/07/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-us-will-have-record-revenues-yea/	As the nation moved closer to breaching the debt ceiling, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that the country has enough money, it just needs to stop spending. On the Oct. 6, 2013, edition of This Week, Stephanopoulos asked Boehner about his stance on passing a "clean" debt limit bill -- that is, a bill that lifts the amount of debt the nation can take on without adding any additional provisions. "So under no circumstances will you pass a clean debt limit?" Stephanopoulos asked Boehner. Boehner responded, "We're not going down that path. ... George, we've spent more than what we've brought in for 55 of the last 60 years. This year, the federal government will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country, and yet we're still going to have a nearly $700 billion budget deficit." Boehner’s a little off when he said that there have been deficits for 55 out of the past 60 years; it’s actually been 51 years out of 60. But in this item, we wanted to look at his claim that the government "will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country." The most recent estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects in excess of $3 trillion in revenues for fiscal year 2014. That would be the highest amount of federal revenue in the nation’s history when measured by raw dollars. However, that’s not the only way to measure federal revenues -- or even the best. That’s because using raw dollars doesn’t take into account either inflation or the growing economy and population. It’s natural that today’s economy -- which is larger than ever, and with dollars worth less than they once were -- would produce the largest amount of revenue in raw dollars. An alternative way of measuring the scale of federal revenues is to measure it as a percentage of gross domestic product. And using this yardstick gives a much different impression. For fiscal 2013, the just-completed fiscal year, the Office of Management and Budget predicted that federal revenues would account for 16.7 percent of GDP. That’s the highest it’s been since 2008, the year the Great Recession hit -- but by historical standards, it’s low. Going back to 1952, revenues as a percentage of GDP were higher than today’s level during 55 of 63 years, or 87 percent of the time. Only in eight years was it lower than today’s 16.7 percent. It reached a high of 20.6 percent of GDP in 2000. When we contacted Boehner’s office, spokesman Brendan Buck said that what Boehner said "is accurate. If you want to write about revenue as a percentage of GDP, that’s a column – not a fact check." However, experts say the difference between the two measurements isn’t trivial. Boehner’s argument was that even with historically unprecedented revenues, the United States still can’t balance its books. He has a point that the nation does face long-term budget concerns, but framing the question the way he did ignores that current revenues aren’t all that massive by historical standards. "If revenues had been even at historically average levels -- whether due to a stronger economy or a different tax structure -- the deficit might be significantly lower," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Our ruling Boehner said that this year, the federal government "will have more revenue than any year in the history of our country." That’s true for raw dollars, but raw dollars aren’t an especially useful measurement for analyzing long periods of history, because inflation, population growth and economic expansion almost inevitably make the most recent year the largest ever. A more reliable method -- revenue as a percentage of GDP -- actually shows that revenues today are historically low compared to most of the past six decades. We rate Boehner’s claim Half True.

pomt-10269	"We spend more on health care than any other country, but we're ranked 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/25/democratic-national-committee/us-spends-more-on-health-care-not-necessarily-heal/	It is a common refrain among politicians lamenting the state of America's health care system: spending more on health care doesn't necessarily make the United States a healthier country. That's a theme repeated in the report accompanying the Democratic Party's convention platform. It claims, "We spend more on health care than any other country, but we're ranked 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality." The first part of the statement is certainly true. The United States has spent more per capita on health care than any other country for decades, and its spending has grown faster, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation analysis shows that in the most recent figures available, U.S. spending on health care per capita was $5,711 in 2003. The second-place finisher, Luxembourg, spends $4,611. As for life expectancy and child mortality, the Democratic National Committee couldn't provide the source for the platform committee's statistics. But the numbers do match Census Bureau statistics that are used in the CIA's 2008 World Factbook, which shows the United States ranks 47th in life expectancy and 43rd in child mortality. You might see different rankings depending on where you look. The United States scores better in lists compiled by the World Health Organization or the United Nations. That's because each of these organizations ranks countries differently. The U.S. Census Bureau includes many more places in its rankings, such as tiny territories and small chunks of countries, as the Wall Street Journal's "The Numbers Guy" blog has pointed out. Still, no matter whose list you check, there's no denying that the United States' infant mortality rate is higher than other large industrialized countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and Japan. And this is true despite the United States being the world leader in spending. We give the Democratic platform committee a True.

pomt-13498	Young women, "account for a shocking 74% of all new HIV infections among adolescents in Africa."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/sep/07/justin-trudeau/do-girls-make-majority-new-hiv-infections-among-af/	International leaders continue to try and shine a light on the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. But do they get their facts right? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently penned a letter decrying the impact of poverty and disease on young girls in Africa, a group he says make up a disproportionate amount of new HIV infections among young people. Trudeau wrote the letter in response to the One Campaign, which sent out an appeal to global leaders asking them to help combat gender inequality. The One Campaign is a worldwide advocacy program that works to raise awareness about poverty and preventable disease. Included in Trudeau’s message was a claim that young women "account for a shocking 74 percent of all new HIV infections among adolescents in Africa." We’ve seen this statistic floating around before. Our partners at Africa Check investigated a nearly identical claim featured in an online article published in April. They concluded that the source of the data was ambiguous, but their independent calculations mostly fell in line with the overall message of the claim. PolitiFact decided to dig into Trudeau’s claim in more detail. Running the numbers Trudeau’s office informed us that the source of his claim is a 2015 reference report authored by UNAIDS and the African Union. The report, titled "Empower young women and adolescent girls," contains a figure claiming that in 2013, 74 percent of new HIV infections among people between ages 15 and 24 in Africa occurred in adolescent girls. But the report’s footnotes section only lists "2013 UNAIDS data" as its source. Where did this data come from, and is it still accurate today? First, it’s important to note that although Trudeau named the entire continent of Africa in his claim, the majority of AIDS estimates in Africa specifically examine sub-Saharan Africa. Alasdair Reid, deputy director of communications and global advocacy at UNAIDS said that discussion of AIDS in the continent usually focuses on sub-Saharan Africa and treats North Africa as a separate region or as part of the Middle East. Katie Smith, communications associate at the Kaiser Family Foundation, referred us to the 2016 Prevention Gap Report, a collection of HIV data and analysis of infection trends from 146 countries. The press release for the report states, "In eastern and southern Africa three-quarters of all new HIV infections among adolescents aged 10–19 years are among adolescent girls." The report made no reference to data analyzing sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. We reached out to UNAIDS to obtain the most recent data for the entire region. The agency pointed us to the 2016 Prevention Gap Report as well, but also gave us up-to-date figures taken from aidsinfoonline.org, a database of AIDS-related statistics. According to a spreadsheet provided by UNAIDS, in 2015, 76 percent of all new HIV infections among adolescents aged 10-19 in sub-Saharan Africa were among adolescent girls. The age range used in the sheet is lower than the 15-24 group used by Trudeau’s source. The officials we spoke to told us that Trudeau’s claim was basically correct, and was actually slightly lower than more recent numbers because it was based on data from 2013. Why girls are so vulnerable to HIV Trudeau’s sobering statistic made us wonder why African girls are so disproportionately affected by a virus that can infect any human being. The experts we talked to stressed that a wide variety of factors ranging from economic circumstances to societal gender norms were responsible for the gap. Anurita Baines, the HIV/AIDS regional advisor at UNICEF’s Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office, stressed that the obstacles most girls in poverty face even when healthy make avoiding HIV infection more difficult. "The primary reasons that girls are more vulnerable have to do with gender inequality, including lack of access to education," she said. "These issues prevent women and girls from negotiating for condoms and safe sex practices." One particular problem is the phenomenon of intergenerational sex, where poor young girls have sex with men who are often at least a decade older. Reid told us that these "blessers" shower poor girls with gifts and money, who then become dependent on the men to stay in school. The result is often unprotected exposure to an HIV-positive partner. However, in recent years an array of initiatives has been developed and implemented to specifically protect young women from HIV infection. Baines highlighted UNICEF’s social protection programs in countries such as Kenya and Malawi that give small cash grants for households with school-age girls. The purpose of the grants is to keep girls in school longer, which delays their sexual debut and reduces their risk of contracting HIV. Ultimately, Baines is hopeful that increased international attention could further advance efforts to fight the disease. "To have someone at a high political level make a statement like that is very encouraging," she said of Trudeau’s claim. "What has to come next is the funding and the support for programs that actually reach these girls and help them." Our ruling Trudeau claimed that young women "account for a shocking 74 percent of all new HIV infections among adolescents in Africa." The data from UNAIDS and UNICEF closely matches his numbers, though Trudeau would have been more precise if he said sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence there shows that young girls between the ages of 10 and 19 are significantly more vulnerable to HIV infection than their male peers due to a wide variety of economic and gender-related issues. Trudeau’s claim is accurate with the small caveat about his use of Africa and not sub-Saharan Africa. We rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/565b33e4-ee02-4513-a724-3e3deeeb8d6c	None	Justin Trudeau	None	None	None	2016-09-07T10:28:17	2016-08-25	['Africa']
pomt-06874	Says New Jersey has fewer jobs since Gov. Chris Christie took office.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/01/joshua-henne/democrat-backed-one-new-jersey-claims-state-has-lo/	On the heels of a cutthroat budget battle, a Democrat-backed group called One New Jersey entered the political scene in mid-July and quickly took aim at Republican Gov. Chris Christie. In a July 20 press release, One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne said: "After nearly two years of Christie’s bluster, middle-class and working families are far worse-off than when he took office – with less jobs and higher property taxes." For this Truth-O-Meter item, PolitiFact New Jersey is focusing on Henne’s claim that New Jersey has fewer jobs now than when Christie took office in January 2010. After reviewing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that the number of non-farm jobs in New Jersey has fluctuated between growth and decline throughout Christie’s tenure. But when Henne made his statement, there was a net increase of jobs, federal data shows. First, let’s explain how labor statistics are compiled. Federal labor statistics are measured through two monthly surveys: household interviews and reports from public- and private-sector employers, commonly referred to as the payroll survey. To support his claim, Henne referred us to household survey data. Those figures show a decrease of 12,266 employed persons in New Jersey between January 2010 and June 2011, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But there’s a major problem with Henne’s argument: he used the wrong survey to talk about jobs. The household survey estimates employed persons, while the payroll survey estimates jobs. That’s a critical difference, especially since many Garden State residents work in neighboring states. Now, let’s turn to the job growth estimates from the payroll survey. When Christie became governor in January 2010, New Jersey had 3,852,600 non-farm jobs. Based on the payroll survey data publicly available at the time of Henne’s statement, New Jersey had 3,859,000 non-farm jobs in May 2011. Both figures were seasonally adjusted. That represents an overall increase of 6,400 non-farm jobs. During that time period, New Jersey was split in terms of job growth on a month-to-month basis -- eight months saw job gains and eight months saw job losses, according to data publicly available at the time of Henne’s statement. New Jersey experienced further non-farm job growth in June 2011, but Jay Meisenheimer, an economist with the Bureau of Labor of Statistics, said the job increases in New Jersey can’t be characterized in any particular direction. "It just looks like a flat trend," he said. Stanford University economics professor Robert Hall agreed in an email that "the most you could say is that the change is around zero." It’s worth noting that New Jersey’s numbers vary between government and private-sector workers. Between January 2010 and May 2011, the number of government employees dropped by 24,700, while private-sector jobs increased by 31,100, according to seasonally adjusted figures publicly available at the time of Henne’s statement. Those changes in private-sector employment are "the most appropriate indicator of what is happening in the NJ economy," according to Rutgers University professor Joseph Seneca. Henne failed to respond to two questions about his use of the household survey to quantify jobs in New Jersey. "We stand by the fact that middle-class and working families took a hit when it comes to jobs. Because it is just that, a fact," Henne wrote in an email. Before we issue our ruling, we should point out that although Henne blamed Christie for job losses, some economists said larger factors include individual job markets and the recession. That's also despite the fact that Christie often has taken credit for creating private-sector jobs. "State policy is an element in job creation and destruction, but the overall condition of the job market in the industries in the state is the larger factor," R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia University Business School, said in an email. Where does all this leave us? To support his claim that there are "less jobs" since Christie took office in January 2010, Henne cited the wrong set of data. The data used to measure jobs shows a slight increase since Christie became governor, even though some economists said the growth is mainly flat. But New Jersey also has seen an increase in private-sector jobs -- a measure considered by a Rutgers professor to appropriately reflect the state of the economy. Beyond crediting or blaming Christie, economists said other factors include the recession and individual job markets. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06553	Chris Christie has not been "effective at creating jobs … (or have) a record of governing for effectiveness. ... New Jersey (has) one of the higher unemployment rates in the country at 9.4 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/03/martin-omalley/under-chris-christie-does-new-jersey-have-one-high/	On the Oct. 2, 2011, edition of CBS’s Face the Nation, two governors -- Democrat Martin O’Malley of Maryland and Republican Haley Barbour of Mississippi -- faced off over a variety of political and policy issues. Host Bob Schieffer brought up one of the hottest political stories of the day -- the potential presidential candidacy of another governor, Republican Chris Christie of New Jersey. After months of denying the possibility of a run, Christie had recently indicated that he’s reconsidering his stance on a GOP primary bid. O’Malley tried to throw cold water on Christie’s record since he took office in January 2010. "When it comes to being effective at creating jobs, improving schools and expanding opportunity, (Christie’s) record in New Jersey has not been a record of governing for effectiveness," O’Malley said. "His bond rating has been downgraded by two of the bond rating agencies. His unemployment in New Jersey is one of the higher unemployment rates in the country at 9.4 percent. Last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs. And his schools, because of the choices he's made to cut education funding, have actually been declining in their national ranking. So that's not a record of leadership and governance and effectiveness." We decided to focus on the two jobs-related claims -- that "New Jersey (has) one of the higher unemployment rates in the country at 9.4 percent," and that "last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs." We’ll rate them in separate Truth-O-Meter items, taking up the first claim in this item. We turned to the most recent state-by-state data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment figures. This data covers August 2011. O’Malley was correct that New Jersey’s unemployment rate in August was 9.4 percent. And he’s correct that New Jersey fared worse than the nation as a whole (9.1 percent) and worse than the regional rate for the middle-Atlantic states (8.4 percent). But was it "one of the higher unemployment rates in the country"? That’s a bit tougher call. New Jersey actually ranked 15th among the 50 states or 16th if you include the District of Columbia. Here’s the list of states that ranked higher than New Jersey in unemployment: Nevada: 13.4 percent California: 12.1 percent Michigan: 11.2 percent South Carolina: 11.1 percent District of Columbia: 11.1 percent Florida: 10.7 percent Rhode Island 10.6 percent North Carolina: 10.4 percent Mississippi: 10.3 percent Georgia: 10.2 percent Alabama: 9.9 percent Illinois: 9.9 percent Tennessee: 9.7 percent Oregon: 9.6 percent Kentucky: 9.5 percent New Jersey: 9.4 percent So does New Jersey have "one of the higher unemployment rates in the country"? It’s higher than about two-thirds of the states, but it’s lower than about one-third. The figures show that New Jersey is "in the bottom third of all states in terms of employment," said Elisabeth Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, which O’Malley chairs. "Perhaps it would have been more accurate to say that Gov. Christie's New Jersey has one of the ‘highest’ unemployment rates in the nation." We’ll also note an underlying flaw in claims like these. O’Malley tries to pin the blame for New Jersey’s relatively weak job market on Christie, when in fact the jobs picture in any given state is influenced by a host of factors, from national and international trends to state policies inherited from a governor’s predecessor. It’s an especially dicey to pin blame on Christie, who has only been in office for a little over a year and a half. Our ruling O’Malley got the figure right (9.4 percent), and he has a point that New Jersey’s unemployment rate is higher than the national and regional averages. However, we think most people, if they heard O’Malley’s claim, would expect that a state with "one of the higher unemployment rates in the country" would rank higher than 15th out of 50 or 16th out of 51. Finally, O'Malley said, "When it comes to being effective at creating jobs … (Chris Christie has not had) a record of governing for effectiveness." Christie’s responsibility for his state’s difficult jobs picture is unclear. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-00700	Says the estate tax, "in many cases," forces family farmers and small businesses owners to sell their holdings.	false	/virginia/statements/2015/may/03/robert-hurt/hurt-amiss-linking-estate-tax-small-farm-businesse/	U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt full-heartedly joined his Republican House colleagues recently in their near unanimous vote to end the estate tax. "The death tax causes serious problems for family farmers and small business owners who want to have their children and grandchildren continue their life’s work," Hurt, who represents the rural 5th Congressional District, said in a statement posted to his website on April 16. "In many cases, this excessive and duplicative tax forces them to sell the farm or business just to pay these punitive taxes, keeping them from passing down the culmination of their lifetime of work to the next generation." We wondered whether Hurt was accurate in saying that the tax, "in many cases," forces the heirs of family farms and small businesses to pull up stakes. Many Republicans -- including other members of Virginia’s congressional delegation and House Speaker John Boehner -- made similar statements after the voted repeal vote. Republicans voted 233-3 for the legislation. Democrats opposed it, 176-7. The measure is expected to be filibustered by Senate Democrats, many of whom say the repeal of the tax -- which brings in almost $22 billion a year -- benefits only the wealthy. We asked Hurt’s press secretary, Abigail Sigler, for the sources of the congressman’s claim. She pointed to three reports published over the years by the Joint Economic Committee. The latest report, issued in 2012 by Republicans on the panel, said "the estate tax remains a burden to family business," but offered no data about the number and farms and businesses that were sold because of the levy. The two other studies, issued in 1998 and 2006, also lacked hard information on liquidation sales and have become archaic. That’s because the estate tax was much steeper in the past than it is today. In 1998, for example, the levy kicked in on estates worth $625,000 from individuals and $1.25 million from couples. Assets at that level or above were taxed at rates up to 55 percent. Today, the federal levy affects estates worth $5.43 million or more from individuals and at least $10.86 million from couples.The tax rate can be as high as 40 percent, although most estates pay considerably less because of deductions available to heirs. The average tax rate rate in 2013 was 16.6 percent, according to a computations of IRS data by the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Few families are wealthy enough to be bothered by the estate tax. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in March that 5,400 people will leave taxable estates this year -- about one in every 500 people who dies, or two-tenths of one percent. The Tax Policy Center, in its 2013 study, came up with an even smaller number: It estimated 3,780 people would leave taxable estates that year. That was roughly one of every 660 people who died. Of those high-end estates, half had some farm or business assets. The researchers drilled down further to separate the estates of wealthy people with diverse portfolios from those whose holdings centered on a farm or business. They concluded that there were only 120 taxable estates in the nation where half of the value or more came from a single farm or business operation. Next, the researchers honed in on how many of those estates belonged to small family farmers and businessmen. So they narrowed their focus to taxable estates worth no more than $10 million with less than half of the assets held in a farm or business. Under that formula, the center concluded that about 20 small farms and businesses across the nation were added to federal estate tax rolls in 2013. "They’re the exception, not the rule," said Roberton Williams, an economist with the center. Alan Viard, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who specializes in federal tax and budget policies, dismissed arguments that the estate tax is killing family farms and small businesses. He said the research by the Tax Center is solid and noted that heirs can take up to 14 years to pay off inheritance tax debts. Viard favors repeal of the estate tax because he believes it discourages saving. He told us the focus on small farms and businesses "is a weak argument against the estate tax that distracts from better reasons to repeal it," he said. There’s one more study we should point out. The U.S. Department of Agriculture concluded last year that 99.4 percent of estates with farms in 2013 were not subject to the so-called death tax. Hurt, as we noted earlier, has lots of company in linking the estate tax to family farms and small businesses. We evaluated Hurt’s statement because it was the strongest made by a Virginia congressman. But we wanted to share these comments made by other Republicans in the state delegation: Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th "Instead of taxing businesses and farms out of existence, repealing the death tax will help to create and maintain jobs." April 16 written statement. Rep. Dave Brat, R-7th "And it’s not just the super wealthy who are affected. It’s also small business owners and farmers whose wealth may not be in cash and stocks, but in the value of their land and equipment." April 17 written statement. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-9th "I am proud today to have voted to repeal the federal death tax policy, and will continue fighting to grow our economy and protect American families, farms, and small businesses." April 16 written statement. Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-10th "Imagine building up a family business or family farm your whole life only to lose much of that business upon the death of Mom or Dad. Under current law, Uncle Sam swoops in and can take up to 40 percent of what you spent a lifetime building up for your children and grandchildren. Today we voted to stop that injustice." April 16 written statement. Our ruling In arguing for the repeal of the federal estate tax, Hurt says the levy "in many cases" forces family farmers and small businesses owners to sell their holdings instead of passing them down. He presents no statistics -- or specific examples -- on liquidations under the federal estate tax structure that went into effect in 2011. The estate tax kicks in on individual assets worth at least $5.43 million and joint holdings of $10.86 million. Hurt ignores a body of research showing a tiny portion of deceased people -- only two tenths of 1 percent, according to a Congressional report -- leave estates that are subject to the tax. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates only 6 tenths of 1 percent of estates with farms qualified for the tax in 2013. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that there were 20 small, closely held farms and businesses that were subject to the tax that year. It’s unknown how many of them, if any at all, were sold to pay the levy. So Hurt’s statement comes up empty. We rate it False.	None	Robert Hurt	None	None	None	2015-05-03T00:00:00	2015-04-16	['None']
pomt-13393	Says Hillary Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership "the gold standard. You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-lauded-controver/	Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump sparred over trade deals past and present in the early moments of their first debate Monday night. Trump has criticized both the North American Free Trade Agreement approved under President Bill Clinton and the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by President Barack Obama’s administration. Hillary Clinton, of course, was part of the Obama administration as secretary of state, and Trump said she’s culpable for supporting what he said was a bad deal. "You called it the gold standard," Trump said of the agreement, known as TPP. "You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen." For her part, Clinton rebutted that she at one time thought it could be the gold standard of trade deals before it was finished negotiated, but became disenchanted once it was finalized. "I did say I hoped it would be a good deal," she said. She similarly defended herself on this point during her primary campaign against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. So what did Clinton say about TPP? Back in 2012 when she was leading the State Department, Clinton was pretty effusive in her support of the deal. While in Australia, Clinton delivered remarks on the general topic of the U.S.-Australia relationship. Here’s everything she said about the TPP in that address, with the "gold standard" comment in bold. "So it's fair to say that our economies are entwined, and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner. This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment." At that point, it seems clear Clinton is saying the TPP sets the gold standard. She didn’t say she "hoped" it would. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung pointed to this statement in Australia to defend his candidate’s statement. Other comments around the same time echoed similar assuredness that the TPP would meet that high bar. In November 2012 remarks in Singapore, she encouraged all nations "willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP" to join the deal. "The so-called TPP will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment," she said, adding that it would result in better jobs with better wages and working conditions. She did not say it was "the finest deal" she’d ever seen. But here are some of the other words Clinton used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: "exciting," "innovative," "ambitious," "groundbreaking," "cutting-edge," "high-quality" and "high standard." Now, at that point, the deal was still being negotiated. And even before it was finalized, she started to temper her expectations for the deal as the campaign drew near. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to this passage in her 2014 memoir Hard Choices: "Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It’s safe to say the TPP won’t be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers." More recently, after the deal was finalized last year and presented for Congress to approve, Clinton changed her position and now says she opposes it. In the past when asked about her wording, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill noted that the "gold standard" comment was made during negotiations and because they were conducted in secret, we don’t know if the final deal is dramatically different than it was in 2012. It’s worth pointing out, too, that as secretary of state, she spoke as a representative of the Obama administration, which was and remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal. Our ruling Trump said Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the "gold standard" of trade deals. Clinton did use that language in 2012 when discussing TPP in Australia. And unlike her rebuttal, she didn’t couch it by saying she "hoped" it would be the gold standard. It’s worth noting that at this point the deal was still under negotiation and because that was done behind closed doors, there’s no way to know how much it changed. Before the final version came out, she advocated more of a wait-and-see approach.

"This is the van ... looks way too staged," wrote one person who posted a picture of a white van to Facebook on Oct. 26. The windows are plastered with what appear to be stickers, including one with an image of CNN commentator Van Jones with the words "dishonest media" and "CNN sucks." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The van isn’t fake, but the suggestion that it’s a plant to support false flag theories is wrong. According to the federal criminal complaint filed against Sayoc, he was "arrested on or about Oct. 26, 2018, in Florida, in the vicinity of his white van. The windows of Sayoc’s van were covered with images including images critical of CNN." Sayoc was apparently living in the van in Aventura, Fla., The New York Times reported on Oct. 26. Some of the town’s residents reported regularly seeing such a van with windows plastered "with a thick collage of pro-Trump stickers," according to the paper. "It struck me because of the crazy, conspiratorial stickers covering the windows," the Times quoted former Aventura resident David Cypkin as saying. "It was unsettling." Other media outlets, including the Washington Post and the Miami Herald, have also reported on the van, posting photos of the vehicle and talking to Floridians who recall seeing the van before the pipe bombs were mailed.

pomt-03887	Says Rick Scott called education not a "core function" of the state.	false	/florida/statements/2013/mar/05/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-say-rick-scott-says-education-no/	With an eye toward his 2014 re-election effort, Gov. Rick Scott has tried to portray himself as a pal of teachers and families who rely on public education. He talks often about how he boosted education spending in 2012 and this year proposed giving teachers a $2,500 pay raise. Not surprisingly, his Democratic foes emphasize different facts and figures about education spending -- including how Scott oversaw a spending cut in 2011. As Scott prepared to deliver his State of the State speech March 5, the Democrats "pre-butted" him with a press release the day before attacking his record on jobs, tax cuts and education. "Scott, the hardcore tea party conservative who spent $5 million of his own money to defeat the Affordable Care Act and who slashed education funding by $1.3 billion, calling it not a ‘core function’ of the state, is now arguing for investments in education and the expansion of Medicaid under the President’s health care law," wrote the Florida Democratic Party. Education sounds like a fairly basic government service or a "core function." Did Scott call education not a "core function" of the state? Scott and the use of the word "core" To support their claim, Democrats pointed to a February 2011 article in Jacksonville’s Florida Times-Union about Scott’s first budget proposal, which called for steep cuts to much of the budget, including education, benefits for state workers, and state jobs. The article quoted Scott at a Tallahassee press conference: "The public expects us to get back to what the core functions of the state are, not things that would be nice but we don't have the money for." Florida Democratic Party spokesman Eric Conrad told PolitiFact Florida that Scott was talking about returning to the "core functions" of the state while also broadly cutting education. "It’s kind of hard to think he considers education to be a core function if he was cutting that much money from it," Conrad said. But we found no place where Scott specifically mentioned education and said it was not a "core function" of government. Instead, Scott talked about the core functions of government in a much more general way, saying only core functions should receive funding. Here are some excerpts from Scott’s comments on core functions. While unveiling his proposed budget at a tea party rally in Eustis on Feb. 7, 2011, Scott said, "The fact is that government has to get back to its core functions. But only its core functions." Later in the speech, when talking about streamlining state agencies, Scott said: "And, by eliminating programs that are not core government functions, remember we are going to go back to what the core function is, not a lot of ‘it would be nice to have,’ just like, that’s not what you get to do right now, we are going to go back to core functions, it will save us another $150 million over two years." Scott did mention education in another part of his speech, saying that he would cut "over $4 billion in taxes over the next two years without any cuts out of state general revenue for education, zero cuts out of state general revenue for education." Actually, state funding for education shrank that year, as we noted in a 2011 fact-check. When Scott called for selling the state airplane in February 2011, he said: "Burdening taxpayers with these ongoing expenses is irresponsible and not a core function for government to meet the state's critical needs." (Scott earned a Promise Kept on PolitiFact Florida’s Scott-O-Meter which keeps track of his promises.) In April 2011, Scott was interviewed on Fox Business News and talked about eliminating teacher tenure and watching how we spend every dollar. Then he said: "We go back to core functions. All of these things are important and we're going to get them -- we're going to get them done." A spokesperson for Scott did not directly address our questions about Scott’s views on what is a "core function." "The governor has always said he is focused on three things: jobs, education and cost of living," said Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz in an email. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said in a press release that Scott called education "not a ‘core function’ of the state." The Democrats point to Scott’s 2011 comments about his budget proposal that included massive and wide-ranging cuts -- including to education. Scott called for focusing on "core functions" of the state. Scott cut the education budget in a year when he talked about funding for "core functions." But he never specifically said education was not a "core function." It’s a stretch and a leap of logic for Florida Democrats to claim otherwise. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14048	"There are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/25/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-oakland-ferguson-are-amo/	Donald Trump named Oakland and Ferguson among the "most dangerous" cities in the world in a recent New York Times magazine interview. Reporter Robert Draper asked Trump to name the most dangerous place in the world he’s been. "Brooklyn," the Queens-native-turned-Manhattanite joked. Then he said."There are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously." Seriously? Trump’s right that a few places in the United States have some of the highest murder rates across the globe — but Oakland and Ferguson are not among them. Experts also pointed out that homicide and other crimes in these cities disportionately affect certain demographics, so it’s not a one-danger-fits-all scenario. Factoring in other security concerns, such as war, terrorism, kidnappings, natural disasters, and other types of violence, even high-crime American cities start looking pretty safe compared to the rest of the world. Murder he tweeted Before we dive into the data, we should note that comparing crime across countries is difficult and discouraged due to disparities in legal definitions, incident reporting and data collection, and social and political contexts. Homicide rates, however, are generally safe to compare. By that metric, four American cities crack the top 50 most dangerous places in the world, as others have noted. The Mexico-based nonprofit Consejo Ciudadano para la Seguridad Publica y la Justicia (CCSP) compiles an annual list of the highest murder rates in the world in cities with more than 300,000 inhabitants. Out of the 50 cities in its 2015 rankings, 21 are in Brazil, eight are in Venezuela (including the murder capital of the world, Caracas), and five are in Mexico. At No. 15, St. Louis is the top-ranking U.S. city in 2015 with a rate of 59.23 per 100,000 inhabitants. Baltimore comes in at No. 19, Detroit is No. 28 and New Orleans is No. 32. Though Trump highlighted one specific murder near Oakland last year on Twitter (the shooting death of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco) and repeatedly warned of riots in Ferguson following the shooting death of Michael Brown in 2014, the homicide rates in both places are nowhere near as high as the places listed by CCSP. According to FBI data from 2014 (the latest complete year on record), Oakland reported 80 murders for a population of 410,000 for a rate of 19.51. Ferguson, with two murders for 21,000 people, had a rate of 9.48. Oakland and Ferguson do not appear in the CCSP ranking of the highest murder rates in the world. Here’s how the two cities cited by Trump stack up next to the top 50: Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf blasted Trump’s claim on Twitter, writing, "The most dangerous place in America is Donald Trump's mouth." But Trump would have actually been right about Oakland in 2012, when it placed at No. 43 on CCSP’s list with a homicide rate of 33.10. That was a peak year for Oakland though, and the city didn’t rank in 2011, 2013 or 2014 either. In 2012, four more U.S. cities (Flint, Mich.; Jackson, Miss.; Newark, N.J.; and Birmingham, Ala.) with populations of 100,000 or more had a higher murder rate than the No. 50 city of Barranquilla, Colombia, with its rate of 29.41. Ferguson’s crime rates, meanwhile, are nowhere near the higher reaches of violent crime in the United States, let alone the world. Because of its small population size, its murder rates vary wildly from any given year. For example, there were five murders in 2011 giving it a rate of 23.5 but the town reported no murders in 2010 for a rate of 0. Ferguson is also part of the greater St. Louis area. Frank Zimring, a crime expert at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that most high-crime American cities have a high concentration of African-Americans, who are also the vast majority of the victims. At its peak in 2006, Zimring noted, only six of Oakland’s 149 homicide victims were non-Hispanic whites. "Whether or not a city is dangerous to you because of the homicide rate, you have to look at who’s being killed," said Matthew Bradley, the regional security director for the Americas at the travel security company, International SOS. "It is the profile of the person who’s there that matters." Make America Safe Again? Of course, murder isn’t the only danger people face. Overall, no American city is "among the most dangerous in the world." International SOS is the world’s largest travel-security firm and operates in around 1,000 cities in 90 countries including conflict zones like Baghdad, Iraq, and high-crime cities like Caracas, Venezuela. "We don’t have any city in the United States rated as high or even medium risk — all are low risk," Bradley said. "I can name at least 20 cities more dangerous than St. Louis." It’s not just about risk; it’s also about the ability to mitigate risk, Bradley explained. So International SOS looks at a variety of factors beyond crime rates like anecdotal evidence, news and social media reports and the capabilities of local authorities. For example, after the Paris terrorist attacks in November 2015, the likelihood of more bombings was still very low because French authorities responded swiftly with hundreds of raids. However, International SOS raised Istanbul’s risk to medium after a series of bombings in the city that authorities had not been able to deter. Despite high crime rates in certain hotspots in specific U.S. cities, police and other authorities are typically responsive and able to contain emergencies. "The national security apparatus of the United States provides resources that can’t be matched by any place in the world. No country can match that," Bradley said. Global consulting firm Mercer, which releases an annual ranking of quality of life standards around the world, shared its safety rankings with PolitiFact. Out of 230 cities, the lowest-ranked U.S. cities were Atlanta, Detroit and St. Louis, all tied at No. 107. Meanwhile, San Francisco tied with Chicago, Honolulu and Houston as the safest U.S cities at No. 54. So where are the most dangerous places in the world? Mercer named Baghdad as the least-safe city in the world. Other war-torn and terrorized cities like Damascus, Syria, Nairobi, Kenya, and Tripoli, Libya, rounded out the 20 least-safe places. The consulting firm’s list matches up with the U.S. State Department’s list of travel warnings. As of May 25, the State Department is discouraging visiting 37 countries for a number of security reasons, from pervasive violence in Venezuela and the Congo to war zones in Syria and Iraq. International SOS, meanwhile, currently has an evacuation status in place for Syria, Yemen, Libya and a few other countries ravaged by conflict. Unlike Caracas, Baghdad and Johannesburg, mitigating risk in a city like Damascus is difficult if not near impossible. Travelers there face improvised explosive devices and other unpredictable threats. In short, there are definitely more dangerous places than Oakland, Ferguson and other American cities. "I don’t have my head on a swivel in Doylestown, Pa.," Bradley said. "If I ever walked outside my house in Honduras — well, I never did." Our ruling Trump said, "There are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously." Four American cities — though not Oakland or Ferguson — have some of the highest murder rates in the world. However, experts told us homicide rates alone are not enough to gauge whether a city is dangerous or not. In considering other security threats like war, terrorism, kidnappings, and other violence as well as the ability to mitigate risks, U.S. cities are nowhere near the most dangerous in the world.

pomt-14915	The debt limit deal "allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/02/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-debt-limit-deal-allows-president-ob/	A bipartisan, bicameral deal to stave off a possible government shutdown and a breaching of the federal debt limit is now on its way to President Barack Obama’s desk. But as it was moving toward congressional approval, some Republican presidential candidates spoke out against it during the GOP debate in Boulder, Colo., arguing that it represented an abdication of fiscal responsibility. One of the critics at the debate was Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. "Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit," Paul said. "It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money." We wondered if Paul was accurately describing the bill, so we took a closer look. The measure in question is the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. (Here’s a summary.) The part of the bill that Paul is referring to -- section 901 -- would temporarily lift the limit on how much money the federal government is permitted to borrow. If the debt limit had not been lifted, the government wouldn’t have been able to pay its outstanding debts, with potentially serious economic consequences and negative reactions from equity and other markets. Historically, the most common mechanism for raising the debt limit was to set a new cap in dollars. Usually, it was possible to estimate how much time would pass before this limit would be reached, based on expected spending patterns, but it was only an estimate. The current legislation, however, utilizes a mechanism that has been used a few times in the past few years. Rather than setting a new dollar amount, it suspends the debt limit until a date certain -- March 15, 2017, which is a few months after a new president and a new Congress are sworn in. So under the newly passed legislation, there is no longer a dollar limit on how much debt the United States can accrue. However, it’s an exaggeration to say that the measure "allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money." To understand why this is so, we’ll take a look at the two types of federal spending -- mandatory spending (which includes both interest on the debt and expenditures commonly known as "entitlements") and discretionary spending. Generally speaking, mandatory spending is determined by a fixed formula and continues on autopilot until Congress and the president change the rules. Discretionary spending, by contrast, must be approved periodically in appropriations bills passed by Congress and signed by the president. For mandatory spending, there is no cap on the amount of mandatory spending, only a date in the future when the debt limit is reimposed. That said, mandatory spending is considered unlikely to increase beyond current projections since it is set by formulas that are relatively straightforward to predict. And Paul exaggerates in attributing this spending to Obama. "Unlimited" mandatory spending would continue regardless of Obama’s actions. Without a bill to change the formulas driving mandatory spending, passed by Congress and signed by the president, this spending would continue. One big example of mandatory spending is Medicare, the popular government-run health insurance program for those over age 65. Paul’s comment is even more inaccurate as it concerns discretionary spending -- the kind of spending that Obama can more directly affect (though even then only with the consent of Congress). The legislation, in addition to temporarily suspending the debt ceiling, forestalled the immediate possibility of a government shutdown, which could have occurred if spending authority for federal agencies had expired. It did this by outlining new discretionary spending levels for the next two fiscal years. The legislation raises the maximum amount the government can spend on both the military and nonmilitary categories of discretionary spending for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. But while this is an increase, it’s not an unlimited increase. Discretionary spending is capped, and unless Obama and the Republican-controlled Congress agree to raise those limits through new legislation, it won’t go any higher than the spending caps in the bill. Our ruling Paul said the debt limit deal "allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money." Under the just-passed legislation, there is no specific dollar amount of debt that the United States can incur between now and March 15, 2017. But discretionary spending is indeed limited by the same bill. Mandatory spending, meanwhile, can be considered unlimited, but that is not something that Obama has unilateral power over, as Paul’s claim suggests. This mandatory spending is set by longstanding formulas, which can only be changed by Obama in concert with both chambers of Congress. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01473	Says personhood legislation she sponsored would not have restricted access to reproductive services and was "simply a statement that I support life."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/30/joni-ernst/braley-ernst-debate-anti-abortion-legislation-impa/	Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, says his opponent in the Senate race, Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst, introduced legislation that would have severely limited abortion rights in Iowa. Not so, Ernst countered in a recent debate. Braley and Ernst -- who are vying to succeed retiring Democrat Tom Harkin in one of the nation’s tightest and most-watched Senate contests -- butted heads over core issues, including women’s rights, in the Sept. 28, 2014, debate in Des Moines. At one point, the candidates were asked if they would pursue abortion-related legislation at the federal level. Braley responded first. (Video here.) "What I won't do," Braley said, "is support the type of legislation that Sen. Ernst introduced in Iowa that would have banned all forms of abortion, that would have prevented certain forms of contraception from being available to Iowa women, that would have prevented in vitro fertilization and would have prosecuted doctors for performing what are now legal procedures." Ernst responded, "The amendment that's being referenced by the congressman would not do any of the things that he stated it would do. That amendment is simply a statement that I support life." This debate has come up before: Earlier this month, Braley released an ad that attacked Ernst on the same grounds. We decided to take a closer look to see whose portrayal was more accurate. In April 2013, Ernst joined 20 other Iowa state senators in sponsoring "personhood" legislation. Had it passed, the measure would have amended the state Constitution to legally define someone as a "person" at conception. The U.S. Supreme Court currently defines a "person" when the fetus is at a stage of "post-viability," said Tim Hagle, a politics and constitutional law professor at the University of Iowa. Ernst has said she believes life begins at conception. At a Republican Senate primary debate in May, she said if a personhood bill passes, she thinks abortion providers "should be punished." Abortion-rights supporters have criticized such "personhood" laws -- which have been proposed in several other states, without having passed -- as creating a legal avenue for lawmakers to restrict women’s access to certain reproductive services. Braley, for instance, said the proposed Iowa legislation would have done a number of things: banned all abortions, prevented access to certain forms of contraception, stopped in vitro fertilization and left doctors open to prosecution. However, that’s speculation -- because at only 200 words, the measure doesn’t include any of those provisions. The measure would have changed the state’s Constitution to say: "The inalienable right to life of every person at any stage of development shall be recognized and protected." Unlike some measures in other states, it did not specifically define the term "person." Although it doesn’t include those specific measures Braley mentioned, the bill’s main sponsor has said the intent behind many personhood bills is to pave a road to protect anti-abortion legislation in the future because they would give legal rights to unborn fetuses. "In and of itself, (the resolution) doesn’t change a whole lot," Republican state Sen. Dennis Guth told the University of Iowa student newspaper. "But it ensures that if pro-life legislation is passed, it won’t be struck down by the Iowa Supreme Court. It’s a supporting document." And if that’s the case, then personhood legislation could provide legal justification for prosecuting anyone who harms a human embryo beginning at conception. This would effectively make abortions illegal, and it could endanger at least some forms of birth control. Some common birth control methods, like intrauterine devices and "Plan-B," can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. (Such forms of birth control were also the ones at issue in the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court case earlier this year.) Ernst has expressed wider acceptance of birth control measures than she has about access to abortion. "When it does come to a woman's access to contraception, I will always stand with our women on affordable access to contraception," she said in Sunday’s debate. "That's something that Congressman Braley has been trying to mislead our women voters on. I do believe in a woman's right to contraception." In-vitro fertilization practices -- when a child is conceived in a lab outside of the body -- could also be affected. In-vitro fertilization specialists often create multiple embryos for one client. After the woman conceives, the remaining embryos may be discarded. If a personhood measure takes effect, it would be illegal to dispose of these extra embryos, and the state could be obligated to find women to gestate them, said Sylvia Law, a professor of law and medicine at New York University. So it’s not hard to imagine impacts of a personhood measure on all of the areas Braley cited -- abortion, contraception, in-vitro fertilization and a risk of prosecution for physicians. But it’s also short of a guarantee that any of these restrictions could come to pass. Experts we interviewed said the law that Ernst sponsored is too ambiguous to predict its legal ramifications. "The amendment, if adopted, may lead to all the effects noted by Bruce Braley, but it remains uncertain since no personhood amendment has yet been passed (in other states)," added Maya Manian, a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and an expert in reproductive health care. In addition, these more restrictive policies couldn’t take effect without overcoming additional hurdles, including overturning federal law, which currently protects women’s right to an abortion, said I. Glenn Cohen, codirector of the Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard University. "Even if it purported to have the effect Braley is worried about, the U.S. federal Constitution is the supreme law of the land and trumps Iowa's state Constitution," Cohen said. Our ruling Ernst said personhood legislation she sponsored would not have restricted access to reproductive services and was "simply a statement that I support life." Both Braley and Ernst have exaggerated here. Ernst has a point that the legislation does not literally call for the restrictions on reproductive rights Braley cited, but it’s more than just a "statement" of principle -- it would change the Iowa Constitution in a way that could, at some point, enable many or all of the consequences Braley foresees to be enacted.

pomt-13433	In the past decade in New York State "more than 30 current and former state officeholders have been convicted, sanctioned or accused of wrongdoing — more than any other state."	true	/new-york/statements/2016/sep/19/elaine-phillips/new-york-has-been-most-corrupt-state-decades/	Lawmakers led away in handcuffs seem like clear signs of a corruption problem in New York State. But the worst in the nation? Elaine Phillips says that’s the case. The Republican is running for a vacant State Senate seat on Long Island, and she has made public corruption in Albany the centerpiece of her campaign. She outlined her plan for state ethics reform in a Facebook post, in which she claimed New York State leads the nation in lawmakers in trouble with the law. "Over the past decade in Albany, more than 30 current and former state officeholders have been convicted, sanctioned or accused of wrongdoing — more than any other state," Phillips said in the post. She referenced the number from an article in the New York Times. Phillips took that claim a step further by saying New York led the pack in corruption among other states. In Albany, running afoul of the law is bipartisan, and not just for backbenchers. Two of the state’s legislative leaders were convicted of corruption charges, former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, and former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, a Long Island Republican. Phillips, mayor of the Nassau County village of Flower Hill, faces Adam Haber, a Democrat who most recently served with the Nassau Interim Finance Authority Board, which monitors the county’s finances. So is Phillips right? Can New York State be the worst in a nation that includes politicians from Illinois - think Rod Blagojevich - and Louisiana, where a recent headline read "New Orleans FBI chief calls political corruption in Louisiana ‘robust’"? Struggle with corruption The New York Times, The Buffalo News and other publications have chronicled more than 30 corruption cases in the past decade. Dr. Jeffrey Milyo and Scott Delhommer from the University of Missouri have compiled a database that focuses specifically on public corruption at the state level across the country. Their research focuses on state legislators, high-ranking executive branch officials, and supreme court justices. They tracked bribery, influence peddling and theft of public funds among other charges. Other studies have looked solely at federal convictions or public officials at all levels of government. The Missouri researchers are the only ones who looked at corruption through a state lens, the kind of cases Phillips talks about. From 2006 - 2015, the Missouri researchers identified 28 corruption cases dealing with state officials in New York. Include 2005, and that number rises to 30. That puts New York first for the number of public corruption cases, followed by Pennsylvania, where 24 cases have been filed over the past decade. New Jersey ranks third with 12 corruption cases. Look further back, and New York State has topped the list since at least 1986, Milyo said. "Historically, New York has struggled with corruption and continues to do so," said Jennifer Rodgers, executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity. "While measuring corruption is a challenge, I think it's fair to say that New York remains one of the most corrupt states if not the most corrupt state." The corruption in New York State is likely rooted in culture, Rodgers says. "Much of corruption is cultural, and in New York that means that you have to think about the way the New York political system has developed over more than 200 years," Rodgers said. "So you start with these corrupt political machines like Tammany Hall, and over time the problem replicates itself as the next generation figures out how things work and how much corruption will be tolerated, and so on down the line. We've made some progress, of course, but not enough." Our ruling In her pitch for ethics reform, Phillips said in a Facebook post that "over the past decade in Albany, more than 30 current and former state officeholders have been convicted, sanctioned or accused of wrongdoing — more than any other state."

pomt-00123	"Obamacare raised premiums by 100 percent and after that 91 percent of the people were covered, but we’re all paying 100 percent more."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/26/george-holding/holding-misleads-obamacare-premium-increase-during/	No matter where you’re voting this November, chances are you’ve heard your fair share of talking points on health care. Across the country, Democrats and Republicans have been trading blows about the Affordable Care Act and Republicans’ efforts to chip away at it. The story is no different in North Carolina’s 2nd Congressional District, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnston, Wake, Nash and Harnett counties. In a debate Monday night, Republican Rep. George Holding sounded off on the ACA, also known as Obamacare, for raising premiums. "Obamacare raised premiums by 100 percent, and after that 91 percent of the people were covered, but we’re all paying 100 percent more," Holding said. Holding’s complaint was a popular refrain for Republicans last year, so PolitiFact has already checked similar claims from President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. John Cornyn and Sen. James Lankford. But the race between Holding and Democrat Linda Coleman, a former member of the state legislature, has morphed into one of the nation’s more competitive contests, so we decided to put Holding’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. In short, Holding’s claim that "we’re all paying 100 percent more" is highly misleading because it conflates the whole insured population with the 2 to 5 percent of people who buy their coverage on the individual market. The numbers at first glance The Holding campaign declined to comment, but Republicans making similar claims last year often cited a 2017 report from the Department of Health and Human Services, which compared premiums from 2013 — a year before the ACA took full effect — to premiums in 2017. That report looked at policies purchased on the individual market and found that premiums were 105 percent higher on average in 2017 than they were four years earlier. A recent press release from the HHS’s Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed that premiums had more than doubled since Obamacare was put in place. "Average individual market premiums more than doubled from $2,784 per year in 2013 to $5,712 on HealthCare.gov in 2017, an increase of $2,928 or 105 percent," the press release said. Experts agree that premiums have gone up, but some have said the 2017 HHS report should be taken with a grain of salt. The report’s limitations David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the 2013 and 2017 figures in the HHS report are not an apples-to-apples comparison. "Their comparison is based on two totally different universes of individuals who are being covered," Anderson said. "The ACA market is significantly more morbid, which means more sick, which means higher claim levels than the pre-2014 market." That’s because before ACA regulations took full effect, people who had pre-existing conditions or other risk factors could be denied coverage or charged higher rates, Anderson explained. Additionally, the HHS report ignored subsidies provided under Obamacare, which lowered out-of-pocket expenses for many policyholders in 2017. These post-subsidy costs are more important anyway, since that’s what they actually have to pay. The HHS study also listed several limitations to its findings, such as: A note that Obamacare imposed many new regulations not fully in place until 2014. "In most states, these regulations increased insurance coverage requirements and would be expected, on average, to increase the price of ACA-compliant plans relative to pre-ACA plans," the report said. A note acknowledging that "older and less healthy people are a larger share of the individual market risk pool (in 2017) than in 2013." The report said this change was likely "a significant cause of the large average premium increases in the individual market." A note explaining that the report did not factor in premium changes in states that set up their own online exchanges, such as California. "To the extent that trends are different in state-based exchanges, the national average increase may differ," the report said. With these limitations in mind, Anderson pointed instead to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care, which he said shows how premiums have changed within the individual market as defined by the ACA. That data compared monthly premiums from 2014 and 2018 and showed that they rose from $273 to $481 during that period for a slightly smaller increase of about 76 percent. For the record, Anderson also said Holding was right that 91 percent of people are currently insured. But even still, the numbers were not the biggest problem with Holding’s statement. Conflating the insurance markets Anderson said Holding’s claim that "we’re all paying 100 percent more" was "extremely problematic" because most people do not get insurance on the individual market, which typically provides coverage that is less comprehensive but more costly. "This is, in my opinion, a very deceptive statement by Rep. Holding, as he is conflating the ACA created and regulated individual market with general experience in other, non-ACA regulated group and government market segments," he said. More than 55 percent of Americans have employer-based health insurance plans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Approximately 19 and 17 percent are insured through Medicaid and Medicare, respectively, and a final 5 percent have military-provided coverage. That means the Affordable Care Act’s individual market covers only about 5 percent of the population, and the percentage that does not receive help from subsidies is even smaller. "The ACA premium increases that (Holding) references are relevant for 2 to 5 percent of the population in the individual market," Anderson said. "They are not reflective of what 86 to 88 percent of the population pays in premiums, where premiums have increased at a far slower rate." Citing data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the State Health Access Data Assistance Center, Anderson said premiums for people covered by their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid have risen at a much slower rate. Employer-sponsored insurance premiums, for example, jumped about 14 to 17 percent between 2013 and 2017. So Holding has cherry-picked the worst example that covers the smallest number of people and implied that everyone is paying 100 percent more for their coverage. Our ruling Holding said, "Obamacare raised premiums by 100 percent and after that 91 percent of the people were covered, but we’re all paying 100 percent more." There are fragments of truth in that, but the way he’s constructed that statement makes it a significant distortion. While a 100 percent increase is what was reported in 2017 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the comparison distorts the truth that the vast majority of Americans encountered. Holding’s claim that "we’re all paying 100 percent more" was especially misleading because only 2 to 5 percent of people are affected by premium increases on the Affordable Care Act’s individual market. Holding cherry-picked the smallest market for insurance and suggested that everyone was suffering that way. But for most people, the premium increases have not been nearly as steep as he said. In particular, it’s simply not true that "we’re all paying 100 percent more." In fact, the vast majority of Americans get their coverage from employers, Medicare or Medicaid. We rate this statement False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

pomt-00805	Despite raising taxes on the wealthy and hiking the minimum wage, Minnesota "is creating jobs at a record pace, unemployment is at a historic low, median income is skyrocketing, and (the) state has a billion-dollar surplus."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/01/occupy-democrats/meme-touts-mark-daytons-economic-successes-minneso/	Recent electoral trends have not been kind to Democratic governors. When Barack Obama was elected president, 28 of the nation’s 50 governors were Democratic. Now, just 18 governors are Democrats, even as lots of current and former Republican governors are considered presidential prospects. But there’s one Democratic governor who’s been getting attention recently, at least in certain social media circles: Mark Dayton of Minnesota. To some Democrats, Dayton is a governor to be emulated -- one who pursued a no-holds-barred progressive course and succeeded in improving the state’s economy. Here’s a recent meme sent to PolitiFact by a reader. It was created by Occupy Democrats, a progressive group with a significant presence on social media. "Hello America. I am Minnesota's Democratic Governor Mark Dayton. Although Republicans nearly lost their minds and predicted an economic disaster, I raised taxes on the wealthy and raised my state's minimum wage a few years ago. Today, my state's economy is creating jobs at a record pace, unemployment is at a historic low, median income is skyrocketing, and my state has a billion dollar surplus -- which I'm going to invest in education." It’s tricky to assign credit for economic accomplishments to particular policies, but in this case, we found problems with most of the meme’s statistical claims. We’ll go through where the meme exaggerates the facts. (Occupy Democrats did not respond to email inquiries.) Here’s a look at the claims, one by one. • "Creating jobs at a record pace." We looked at state-level data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that the number of employed Minnesota residents rose by 31,300 over the course of 2014 and by 35,600 over the course of 2013. That’s a pretty good clip, but it’s still a only middling amount when compared to how Minnesota has done historically. In roughly a half-dozen years since 1990, Minnesota has seen its job gains top 60,000 or even 70,000 a year. So the current pace is hardly a "record." • "Unemployment is at a historic low." As we noted, unemployment in Minnesota today is an impressive 3.7 percent. But that isn’t a "historic low." In fact, it was lower for almost four and a half consecutive years, from January 1997 until May 2001. During that stretch, the unemployment rate went as low as 2.5 percent. • "Median income is skyrocketing." Median household incomes have been increasing in Minnesota faster than the United States as a whole. Over the past three years, inflation-adjusted, median household incomes have increased more than twice as fast in Minnesota as in the U.S. -- up by 9.5 percent in Minnesota between 2010 to 2013, as opposed to 4.4 percent nationally. Still, to put this in context, that means the median Minnesota household has seen its real incomes rise by 1.7 percentage points per year faster than the country as a whole. That’s certainly progress, but we don’t think most people would consider that rate of increase "skyrocketing." • "A billion dollar surplus." This is the one point on which the meme appears to be accurate (and, in fact, underplays the number). The state is looking at a projected surplus of nearly $1.9 billion. We should reiterate that, by national standards, Minnesota is indeed doing well. The state has a 3.7 percent unemployment rate -- the fifth best of any state and significantly lower than the national rate of 5.5 percent. And Minnesota ranks seventh-highest among the 50 states in median household income. But this meme doesn’t just say that Minnesota has better-than-average metrics for employment and income -- it uses some very specific superlatives that aren’t in tune with the data. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said that Minnesota "is creating jobs at a record pace, unemployment is at a historic low, median income is skyrocketing, and (the) state has a billion-dollar surplus." While Minnesota is doing well on several key economic measurements, its achievements do not qualify as a "record," "historic" or "skyrocketing." Only the meme’s budget surplus claim is correct. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Occupy Democrats	None	None	None	2015-04-01T16:02:44	2015-03-31	['Minnesota']
pomt-14421	"When the City and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, crime went down 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years."	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/mar/10/jim-kenney/hunting-park-after-5m-fixes-area-much-safer/	As he asked Philadelphia City Council to consider a $300 million investment in the city’s parks and recreation centers, Mayor Jim Kenney told a success story. During his budget address in council chambers last week, the first-year mayor said that when the city and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, "crime went down 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years." That seemed like a huge drop in a high-crime area of the city, so we decided to check out the claim. The Kenney administration said it got the statistic from a Dickinson College study conducted in conjunction with Philadelphia Police and the Fairmount Park Conservancy, a nonprofit that leads capital projects and programming across 10,200 acres of Fairmount Park and 100 neighborhood parks throughout the city. Meg Holscher, the Conservancy’s senior director of development, said the 87-acre Hunting Park in North Philadelphia was identified in 2008 as an area of development because of how close it was to a high number of families. At the time, prostitution and drug trade were common in and around the park. After community meetings and input from neighbors, the Conservancy -- along with the Philadelphia Department of Parks and Recreation -- presented a master plan for the park in October 2009 that outlined two new playgrounds, a community garden and farmers market, new tennis courts and youth tennis programming, as well as a renovated football and soccer field. One of the most visible changes, though, was 64 lights placed around the park, which Holscher said residents wanted to curb illegal activity and violence. "This project for us was a little bit of a game changer," she said. "We’ve started to look at parks and how they are tied to healthy eating, healthy living and violence prevention." Holscher said the $4.5 million Hunting Park capital projects and programming was funded through both public and private funds. In addition to that, another $500,000 was added through grants and corporate donations, bringing the total amount for phase one of the revitalization to some $5 million. After efforts to spruce up the park started in 2010, Conservancy staff started hearing from community members that it seemed like crime in the area had slowed, but an analysis wasn’t completed until 2014. That year, Amanda Vandenburg, then a researcher at Dickinson College in Carlisle, was interested in how parks influence communities. Vandenburg said she analyzed public data from the Philadelphia Police Department and charted crime statistics from 2006, before the revitalization efforts began, through 2013, when the first phase of the project had wrapped up. The data included both part I crimes (violent crimes like homicide, rape and aggravated assault) and part II crimes (like simple assault, prostitution, drug possession and other non-violent offenses.) She mapped instances of crime from inside and a half-mile buffer around the park, and found that there was a spike in crime between 2006 and 2007. After that point, crime began decreasing in 2008 citywide as police enforcement efforts in Philadelphia changed under a new mayoral administration. But crime continued to go down near Hunting Park. Between 2009 and 2013, "there was an 89 percent drop in the number of crimes," according to Vandenburg’s study. Rape and theft from vehicle crime incidents increased over that time period, but other crimes decreased, including prostitution and drug use. Vandenburg also conducted a "hot spot" analysis that showed areas predicted to have the highest amounts of crime were closer to and in the park in 2009 and moved away from the park by 2013. While she said the revitalization of Hunting Park can’t be attributed as the only reason for a decrease in crime in the immediate area, the data does support the theory that illegal activity in the area decreased as the park was improved. Our Ruling Kenney used the efforts in Hunting Park as an example of why City Council should authorize more funds to revitalize parks and recreation centers throughout the city. He said "when the city and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, crime went down 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years." The Fairmount Park Conservancy confirmed that it -- along with the city and private donors -- invested about $5 million in revitalizing the park. Vandenburg, who conducted the study, said crime did in fact drop by 89 percent within a half-mile radius over the next three years. We rule the claim True.

pomt-15022	Glen Sturtevant is "against smaller class sizes."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/oct/05/dan-gecker/dan-gecker-says-glen-sturdevant-against-smaller-cl/	The flier landing in mailboxes across the 10th Senate District -- courtesy of Democrat Dan Gecker -- has a photo of a girl sitting at a school desk, staring pensively. "Glen Sturtevant Has the Wrong Priorities For Our Schools," the mailer says. Underneath, a red box with white capital letters provides the kicker: "AGAINST SMALLER CLASS SIZES." We investigated whether Sturtevant, a Republican, has opposed lowering class sizes since he was elected to the Richmond School Board in 2012. It’s a claim that Gecker, a Chesterfield County supervisor, repeatedly has made against Sturtevant in their race for the state Senate. They’re vying for a seat long held by Republican John Watkins, who’s not seeking re-election. During the past two weeks, we’ve come across two other Gecker mailers that make the same charge but with a little more detail. One says Sturtevant is "the only school board member to vote against reducing class sizes." The other says he was the only member to "vote against a budget that reduces class sizes." Footnotes on all the mailers refer to a May 28, 2015, article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch about the Richmond School Board’s 8-1 vote for a $271.5 million budget for the fiscal year that started July 1. The article cited several initiatives in the budget, including these two: $1.3 million for "reducing class sizes for kindergarten through third grade." This referred to a budget item providing money to hire an additional 17 permanent K-3 teachers. About $2.5 million to expand the teacher work year from 191 days to 194. The three extra days are professional development days -- time for teachers to attend seminars and workshops designed to help them improve their craft. Part of the expense is to pay the teachers for the three extra days they need to work. The article noted that Sturtevant was "the lone vote of dissent on the budget" and explained his rationale. It reported that Sturtevant favored giving teachers an outright 2 percent raise and opposed adding the professional development days to their year, because he thought Richmond’s professional development programs were subpar and first needed to be improved. Sturtevant, it was reported, said the unconditional 2 percent raise would help Richmond compete for teachers with surrounding suburban school systems. There was no mention in the article about Sturtevant’s view on lowering K-3 class sizes or of any debate on the topic. A video of the three-hour School Board meeting on May 26 confirms The Times-Dispatch’s account. Sturtevant didn’t mention class sizes in his critique of the budget. Sturtevant told us he supports lower K-3 class sizes in Richmond, noting that his wife is a first-grade teacher - in Chesterfield - and they have a son in kindergarten at Mary Munford Elementary School in Richmond. It turns out that all 17 of the new K-3 teachers hired for permanent status this school year were long-term substitute instructors who worked in Richmond last school year, according to an email we received from Ralph Westbay, the city’s assistant superintendent for financial services. A long-term substitute is someone who fills in for a teacher who is absent for an extended time and assumes more duties and must have more instructional training than short-term substitutes. Westbay said the school system has not yet computed the effect the 17 teachers have had on K-3 class sizes but said he does not expect student-to-teacher ratios to be "appreciably changed." Our ruling Gecker says that Sturtevant, his opponent in the 10th District Senate race, "is against smaller class sizes." He bases the claim - almost a charge of apostasy against a School Board member - on Sturtevant’s vote against the $271.5 million Richmond school budget for 2015-16. It contained $1.3 million to hire 17 new K-3 teachers. But a Times-Dispatch article Gecker cites to prove his claim provides no evidence Sturtevant opposes smaller classes, nor does a video of the meeting at which Sturtevant cast his vote. What they show is that Sturtevant opposed the budget because it did not contain a 2 percent raise for teachers. Sturtevant did not mention class sizes in laying out his objection to the spending plan. He tells us he supports smaller class sizes. The Richmond school budget is a 262-page document. Sturtevant’s vote against the budget does not entitle Gecker to determine which of its countless line items Sturtevant opposed. There’s a burden on Gecker to prove that Sturtevant "is against smaller class sizes," and he comes up empty. We rate Gecker’s statement False.

pomt-05384	Says Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley reduces 36 percent of felonies to misdemeanors and hands them off to her.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/may/07/jana-duty/jana-duty-says-john-bradley-hands-36-percent-felon/	In Williamson County, north of Austin, the elected county attorney is challenging the district attorney in the May 2012 Republican primary, saying he’s not so tough on crime. An April 15, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story quotes Jana Duty criticizing the share of cases District Attorney John Bradley has sent her way. "He reduces 36 percent of his felony cases to misdemeanors and passes them on to me," she said. Refresher: A felony is an offense, as in murder or burglary, of graver character than a misdemeanor, which is a minor offense. The Statesman article quotes Bradley as saying that plea bargains are a common practice and that his office resolves many low-level offenses by getting defendants to plead guilty to misdemeanors handled by the county attorney in the county court-at-law. So, does Bradley reduce 36 percent of his felony cases to misdemeanors? Not exactly, Duty conceded when we inquired, adding that contrary to what she told the newspaper in an emailed response, she typically says 36 percent of cases that start as felonies in the district attorney’s office are either dismissed outright or reduced to misdemeanors entrusted to prosecution by the county attorney’s office. Duty offered as an example of her usual comment on the topic her written April 17, 2012, reply to a question from the Community Impact newspaper. Asked why she’s running for district attorney, Duty’s reply says, in part, that Bradley "reduced or dismissed 36 percent of his felony cases to misdemeanors and passed them off to my office." For the Statesman article, Duty responded to a reporter’s question about whether she had ever prosecuted a felony by saying she has prosecuted felonies. Her reply continued: "John Bradley is reducing 36 percent of all felonies to misdemeanors and passing them off to my office. That’s double the statewide average." Duty told us by email that she had not aired the percentage to complain about her workload. "The two points that I am making are these: One, 36 percent is too high," she said, saying that statewide in 2011, the average rate for dismissing some felony cases and referring some as misdemeanors was 16 percent. "This is not being ‘tough on crime,’" she said by email. Bradley later told us law enforcement officers initially indicate their judgment on whether a case should be a felony or misdemeanor. Then the DA’s office evaluates each case, he said. Duty said she based the cited percentages on information collected and posted online by the Texas Office of Court Administration, which provides technical support and administrative assistance to the state’s courts and judges. From the office’s website, it’s possible to download a report on "felony case activity" covering any recent time period for a county or the state. And according to the office’s information, of 2,013 total felony cases resolved in Williamson County in 2011, 738 -- 37 percent -- were "dismissals." Statewide, 16 percent of felony cases disposed were dismissals, according to the office’s information. According to instructions for the district clerks who monthly update the figures, each case represents a charge against a defendant so several cases could involve a single person. However, if a defendant faces a multicount indictment, the instructions say, that’s to be recorded as one case based either on the most serious charge or the first charge leveled against them. Those instructions also say the district clerks should report as dismissals those felony cases dropped for reasons including insufficient evidence; the defendant going unapprehended, being granted immunity for testimony or getting convicted in another case; a failure to hold a speedy trial; a decision to drop the case only to re-file a charge; or other unspecified reasons. Another part of the instructions says "transfers to county-level courts in your county when the case is reduced to a misdemeanor" should be recorded in the "all other dispositions" category. In 2011, though, only 21 Williamson County cases fell into the "all other dispositions" category. What the heck? Lisa David, the Williamson County district clerk, cleared up our confusion, saying in a telephone interview that felonies reduced to misdemeanors are mostly marked in the state database’s "dismissals" category. She said that’s because felony cases that become misdemeanors are mostly dismissed as a defendant agrees to plead guilty to a misdemeanor -- developments that fit the "dismissals" category. In telephone interviews and by email, Bradley challenged the significance of Duty's cited "dismissals" percentage because not every felony charge is counted in the database under the method prescribed by the state. "This is an ongoing issue with clerks and statistics," Bradley said. "If this is true, then the total number of felony offenses being filed is being seriously undercounted." In a telephone interview, Angela Garcia, an Office of Court Administration official, agreed that the database records the disposition of only one case for each defendant facing a multicount indictment -- the first one or the most serious one. "You could have 10 charges in a case, but it would only be counted as one case," Garcia said. Garcia, the agency’s judicial information manager, said, too, that the information in the database is not a precise indicator of the number of felony cases a district attorney hands off since the "dismissals" category is broad. All figures in the database are intended to help state lawmakers and other policymakers make decisions about creating, cutting or expanding programs, she said. Given uncertainties about the applicability of the database to Duty’s claim, we asked David, Duty and Bradley for precise counts for 2011 cases initially classified as felonies later converted to misdemeanors. David told us by email that her office could not break out how many felony cases were converted to misdemeanor cases. Bradley initially said he did not have a count. He later said by email that his office’s staff did track the number of 2011 felony cases referred to the county attorney as misdemeanors: 352. That would be a shade under 18 percent of the county’s felony cases resolved that year, according to the state database. Bradley further said that in more than 90 percent of the referred cases, his office had already worked out plea agreements, meaning the county attorney simply had to file the cases and present the guilty pleas for judicial approval. For her part, Duty provided a chart indicating that by her office’s tally, nearly 390 felony cases were reduced to misdemeanors in 2011. If so, that would have been a little over 19 percent of all the cases shown as disposed on the state database. Duty, who through May 6, 2012, had not sought a correction of her original comment to the newspaper, summed up by email: "Bradley reduces 20 percent of his felonies and he dismisses 16 percent of his felonies. This is a total of 36 percent of his cases being dismissed/reduced. I have repeatedly made this statement publicly for months and I stand by it." Our ruling As Duty acknowledged to us, her published comment mistakenly indicated that 36 percent of felony cases in 2011 were reduced to misdemeanors handed off to her office; the relevant "dismissals" category on the state database folds in both cases dismissed and cases referred as misdemeanors. The state database relied upon by Duty does not include a single category breaking out cases referred as misdemeanors, though the counts provided by Bradley and Duty indicate that the share of felonies referred to the county attorney’s office as misdemeanors in 2011 was less than 20 percent. We’ll accept that Duty accurately described the 36 percent figure in other venues. However, her quoted claim to the Statesman rates Mostly False.

pomt-08027	"You’ll find blacks in almost every regiment throughout the South who fought right alongside white Southerners," during the Civil War.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/07/ray-mcberry/sons-confederate-veterans-spokesman-said-blacks-fo/	As the 150th anniversary of the Civil War's start approaches, a group of proud Southerners is belting out a rebel yell. The Georgia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans paid the History Channel to air commercials that reject the view that the South fought the Civil War over slavery. The cable network dropped them after a complaint. The head of public relations for the group's Georgia Division blasted the move Dec. 15 during "Morning Edition" on Atlanta public radio station WABE-FM (90.1). "You’ll find blacks in almost every regiment throughout the South who fought right alongside white Southerners," said Ray McBerry. "And in almost every case, it was a voluntary decision that the freed blacks made." Blacks? Fighting in almost every regiment? For a regime that backed slavery? When we asked McBerry to elaborate, he said that it is "an incontrovertible fact of history" that blacks fought willingly as soldiers and in large numbers. "They served just like white Southerners did," McBerry said. He referred us to Charles Kelly Barrow, former historian in chief for the national SCV and a Griffin high school teacher, and books written and edited by Barrow and supporters of the theory. We interviewed Barrow, talked to history professors and reviewed Civil War scholarship. First, a brief note. The debate over blacks in the Confederacy is part of an ugly disagreement over whether the Civil War was fought over slavery. People on both sides accuse each other of rewriting history to suit their prejudices. This fact-check is not about that issue. We're only looking at McBerry's statement. Historians typically scoff at the idea that black soldiers served in large numbers for the Confederacy. "I've been fighting this myth for years," said William Blair, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and director of the George and AnnRichards Civil War Era Center. Documentation of blacks fighting for the South is scarce. There are anecdotes where blacks in Confederate regiments picked up muskets to fight or to defend themselves, but not enough to prove that it happened often, Blair and other historians said. Blacks were barred from the Confederate army until just before the end of the war. While SCV members are correct that Civil War history is complicated, their conclusion goes too far, said Brian Wills, director of the Center for the Study of the Civil War Era at Kennesaw State University. "The fact was that you wouldn't want to arm people you considered capable of an insurrection," Wills said. For the most part, the Civil War was a white man's fight by the North and South. The Union Army barred blacks until after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Some 180,000 blacks served in the Union army, often in support roles. In the South, arming blacks was controversial. States restricted or banned blacks from owning guns. They became laborers instead. Thousands of blacks, free and slave, worked as Confederate cooks, teamsters, fortification builders, and medical care providers. Slaves went to war with their masters to tend to their needs. This work brought African-Americans to the front lines. Gen. Robert E. Lee quietly supported the enlistment of blacks, and another general lobbied to emancipate and arm slaves. But President Jefferson Davis squelched such talk, saying the idea "would revolt and disgust the whole South." The Confederate Congress finally authorized the enlistment of 300,000 black troops in March 1865, after the white ranks were thinned by combat, disease and desertion. The war ended weeks later. Few blacks had enlisted by that time. Still, the idea that blacks fought in large numbers for the Confederacy has ardent advocates. The prologue of "Black Confederates," a book edited by Barrow, cites "conservative estimates" of 50,000 to 60,000 of them but gives no evidence to support the numbers. Books that purport to prove the phenomenon was widespread are collections of anecdotes where blacks and mixed-race men wore Confederate uniforms, worked as sharpshooters, volunteered to fight, and even killed Union soldiers in battle. Barrow's "Black Confederates" documents 61 blacks who received pensions from state and local governments in North Carolina, Mississippi and South Carolina. Nearly 300 applied for pensions in Tennessee, it says, but it's unclear whether they received them. Records suggest they were noncombatants. Yet even if you accept all of these accounts, they fall well short of proving McBerry's case. These were isolated cases. There were 500,000 to 2 million (estimate vary widely) Confederate soldiers who took part in the war. McBerry and Barrow boost the number of black Confederates by counting black laborers as soldiers, saying soldiers perform similar duties for the present-day U.S. Army. "They [blacks] ate the same bad food, and when it rained on soldiers, it rained on them," Barrow said. "People, regardless of whether they're black or white, they need to be honored for their services because they gave so much." But the difference between a black laborer and a Confederate soldier is more than a matter of formal recognition. It's fundamental. Bondsmen were property. If they resisted, they ran the risk of being terrorized, beaten or worse. Furthermore, even if large numbers of blacks wanted to fight for the Rebel cause, the obstacles would have been daunting. Thousands would have had to bear arms even though it was illegal and join forces with armed white soldiers who did not want them as comrades. We find that McBerry's claim that blacks "fought right alongside white Southerners" and "in almost every regiment throughout the South" is incorrect, if not absurd. Even supporters of his theory have found nothing more than isolated cases. If McBerry's claim were true, it would not only mean that thousands of blacks took up arms for a government that supported their enslavement, it would also mean they were willing to battle overwhelming odds to do it. We rate McBerry's statement Pants on Fire.	None	Ray McBerry	None	None	None	2011-01-07T06:00:00	2010-12-15	['Southern_United_States', 'American_Civil_War']
pomt-08638	"The stimulus has not created one private sector job."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/sep/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-stimulus-create-single-private-job/	For Rick Scott, a Republican businessman running for governor, distinguishing himself from a Democratic competitor who also focuses on jobs is simple: He ties her to "President Obama’s agenda." So at a Sept. 3, 2010, appearance before Tallahassee reporters, the Friday before Labor Day, he described how he differs from Alex Sink on job creation by mentioning Obamacare, the Bush tax cuts and the federal stimulus. When a reporter asked for specifics, he said: "I think it's very simple. Higher taxes kill jobs. Regulations kill jobs. Obamacare is an unbelievable job killer. It's going to be devastating for our state. That by itself is going to make it very difficult for people to do business in our state. And the taxes, the increase in taxes for that is going to be devastating to our state. "On top of that, my background is I put my money up. I took the risk. I stood up for what I believed in starting businesses. And that’s a whole different background than other people. But she clearly believes in higher taxes. She clearly believes in Obamacare. She clearly believes in the stimulus, and we know the stimulus has not created one private sector job." We'll set aside for now his various claims about taxes, regulation and health care to focus on his parting blow: "The stimulus has not created one private sector job." He's treading dangerous ground. In February, PolitiFact looked at a similar statement by Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, that the stimulus bill "didn't create one new job," and found it so ridiculous it earned a Pants on Fire ruling. But Scott said "one private sector job." Does it help his case? Since Scott's running to govern Florida, we'll focus on the stimulus' impact in his state, familiar ground. By stimulus, campaign spokesman Joe Kildea confirms, Scott means the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. That federal money comes in three broad categories, such as funds to federal agencies spent through grants and contracts, funds for benefits such as unemployment and Medicaid, and tax relief, according to Don Winstead, the state’s stimulus czar. For funding in the first category, there's a federal reporting system. Those who get funds must report how much they spend, and how many jobs are created or saved. According to the latest figures on the federal Recovery.gov website — just roll your mouse over Florida — the number of full-time equivalent jobs created or saved in the state just for the April to June quarter is 40,604. That number represents 79,365 actual workers, a state summary says. While the reports don’t break out private sector jobs from public ones, it’s clear some of the jobs — and in some cases, most — end up with private sector contractors, said Winstead, special adviser to Gov. Charlie Crist on the economic stimulus. He produces the summary of Recovery Act information for the state. A table listing 2,951 full-time equivalent jobs created or saved under the U.S. Department of Transportation would largely represent private sector highway construction jobs, he said. On the other hand, the 27,815 listed under education would be largely public school employees. Public and private, the cumulative job impact for the state including tax relief is 167,000, his summary says. Meanwhile, a non-government analysis by data company Onvia at Recovery.org estimates the stimulus’ effect on jobs at 206,000. That's certainly more than one! But wait ... Scott campaign spokesman Kildea is quick to jump on such figures, pointing out that since the government tracks jobs "created or saved," it's hard to say how many have been "created," which is the word Scott used. Additionally, the Recovery.gov reporting has acknowledged flaws. A May report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office says that while data from recipients of stimulus money are improving, "errors and reporting inconsistencies remain." So we examined a specific stimulus-funded program, Florida Back to Work. It's paid for with funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program -- established by the stimulus bill -- which may be spent on subsidized employment. The program is operated by the Florida Agency for Workforce Innovation, which administers other benefit programs and tracks the unemployment rate. It got its federal funding in March, and reimburses employers for most of the costs of a new employee through Sept. 30, 2010. As of Sept. 10, it had paid for jobs for 5,324 new employees. It has also worked with employers to create 4,053 positions posted at employflorida.com and open to job-seekers. So, are any of those private-sector jobs? A summary from the agency lists more than 1,000 Florida employers who've agreed to create jobs using the program. Some are public, such as the Department of Children and Families in Okaloosa County. Others are nonprofits, such as Goodwill Easter Seals of the Gulf Coast. And yes, there are plenty of private companies, for example, Riviera Beach pharmaceutical manufacturer Sancilio & Co. Alex Sancilio, a principal in the Palm Beach County company and director of human resources, has used the Back to Work program to make 27 new hires and keep 15 full-time employees. The company produces drugs and supplements, including children's vitamins and fish oil pills. She worked with the local workforce board to get resumes, and used the money to speed up hiring she might have otherwise spread out. That's how she came to hire Billy Weston as an account executive. Weston, 48, was a car salesman who had been unemployed two months, which helped qualify him for the program. Sancilio says she wouldn't otherwise have invested in retraining someone who didn't have a pharmaceutical background. "If we hadn't had the funding, we never would have given him the time to learn the skills," she said. "We're very, very happy." So what does Scott's campaign have to say about Weston, a guy with a job in the private sector because of the stimulus? "It's a ridiculous assertion that the stimulus has created jobs," Kildea said. "That's exactly the reason Floridians are so upset with the direction of the economy. No matter what sort of intellectual gymnastics used by Obama liberals, the fact is that when the stimulus was first signed, Florida's unemployment rate was 9.2% and today it is 11.6% and the state lost a net of almost 200,000 jobs." So, because more jobs were lost overall than gained, that's the same as saying not one job has been created? Not according to Rebecca Rust, senior economist for the Agency for Workforce Innovation. In fact, it's standard to talk about jobs gained, even when jobs lost may be greater. "There's churning in the job market," she said. "Employers are adding and cutting at the same time. … Just because we have a job loss, you can't say we haven't gained any stimulus jobs. What you could say is that the job losses could have been greater." Sean Snaith, a University Of Central Florida economist who has been critical of the effect of the stimulus, agrees that saying "the stimulus has not created one private sector job" is inaccurate. "I think that's an exaggeration of the reality, which is that it didn't do very much for private sector hiring," he said. "But surprise, surprise, in politics there's hyperbole sometimes." It's more than hyperbole to Billy Weston. Here’s his reaction to Scott’s statement: "I disagree. I have to. Even though, you know, I'm a devout Republican, that's absolutely wrong," he said. "I'm living proof that this helped out, tremendously. I couldn't agree with that statement whatsoever. I know, due to this program, I have a job at Sancilio & Co. That's the reality of it." Beyond Florida, there are examples Scott ought to be familiar with. Take telecommunications company XFone, which announced in March that it received $63 million in federal stimulus money. Scott owns about 15 percent of the company, campaign spokesman Chad Colby said. On Sept. 13, 2010, a Louisiana subsidiary, Pride Network Inc., got approval for $36 million in additional stimulus funding — money it estimates will create 1,300 jobs. Colby says Scott’s a minority investor, doesn’t sit on the board, and doesn't control any operations of the company. "His position on stimulus hasn't changed," Colby said. "If the argument is that the stimulus is the only way to create jobs, it's false." But that isn’t Scott’s statement. In the face of Billy Weston and now 1,300 jobs at a company Scott partly owns, his campaign still hasn’t moved from its stance that "the stimulus has not created one private sector job." He may disagree that the stimulus is the most effective use of funds, or argue as Snaith does that "it didn't do very much." But those aren’t the words he chose. With thousands of Floridians employed because of stimulus-funded programs — not to mention jobs for a company in which Scott owns stock — we rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-00699	A Penn State University study found that "electronic cigarettes . . . are far less addictive than cigarettes."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/may/03/dino-baccari/e-cigarette-maker-study-shows-electronic-cigarette/	Electronic cigarettes are devices designed to mimic cigarettes without burning tobacco. Instead, a liquid is rapidly heated, turning it into a gas that users inhale. Often the liquid contains nicotine, the highly addictive substance that keeps smokers hooked. Many smokers say e-cigs have allowed them to stay away from conventional cigarettes and avoid the cancer-causing chemicals they generate. Whether e-cigs should be regulated and banned from public areas the way most tobacco products are, has become contentious here and across the country. The health risks posed to users of e-cigarettes and the people nearby remain uncertain. Some products give off visible smoke, while others don't. Some of the liquids vaporized by the devices contain pleasant flavors, sparking fear that non-cigarette smokers -- particularly teens -- will embrace them and become addicted to nicotine. Complicating the debate: some liquids don't contain any nicotine at all, which avoids the health risk that nicotine is known to pose. Against this backdrop, the Rhode Island Senate Committee on Health & Human Services held a hearing April 16, 2015, on two proposals. The first, S-482, would require vendors to post the same warning signs that go with conventional tobacco products when they sell e-cigarettes. The second, S-489, "prohibits the use of electronic nicotine delivery system products in public places and places of employment," just as smoking is prohibited. One person to testify against both bills was Dino Baccari, whose North Providence company, White Horse Vapor, makes and sells e-cigarettes. Baccari contended that even though conventional cigarettes and most e-cigs contain nicotine, "vaping" on an e-cigarette is not as addictive. He said he had the evidence to prove it. "Penn State University, Dec. 17 of 2014, found that electronic cigarettes … are far less addictive than cigarettes," he told the committee. Because nicotine is the driving force in tobacco addiction, and nicotine content in vaping products varies widely, we wondered if Baccari's assessment of the research was correct. He sent us a link to the Penn State website where a Dec. 9, 2014, news release declared: "E-cigarettes less addictive than cigarettes." The chief author of the study, published in the respected journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research, was Jonathan Foulds, professor of public health sciences and psychiatry at Penn State's College of Medicine. He told us that former smokers who now use electronic cigarettes indicated that e-cigarettes were far less addicting. The conclusion was based on an online survey with 158 questions, some of which were designed to assess things such as withdrawal, craving and frequency of use. Just over 3,600 e-cigarette users responded. Here are some of the findings in which the e-cigs users were asked comparable questions about their smoking and vaping: * While 86 percent reported "strong," "very strong" or "extremely strong" urges to smoke a cigarette, the rate was just 12 percent with e-cigarettes. * While 41 percent said their cravings were so strong they had woken up at night to smoke cigarettes, only 7 percent of e-cigarette users said they had done that. * While 92 percent said they were more irritable when they were unable to smoke their cigarettes, only 26 percent reported that type of irritability when they can't use their e-cigarette. * "Over 90 percent reported that they had experienced strong urges to smoke and withdrawal symptoms when a smoker, but only 25 to 35 percent reported experiencing these symptoms of dependence as an e-cig user." Foulds said it's likely that e-cigarettes are less addictive because they are not as efficient at getting nicotine into the body as cigarettes. "They deliver less nicotine and less quickly," Foulds said. The highest dependence levels were seen among e-cigarette users whose liquids contained the highest levels of nicotine and among users of newer e-cigarette products that deliver more nicotine to the body faster. But even those customers reported that they felt less addicted than when they smoked tobacco. Such research is not without its potential problems, as Foulds acknowledged. People may not accurately recall their cravings from their days as cigarette smokers. Also, it was an online survey that anyone could take, although the team tried to flag people who might have a financial interest in promoting e-cigarettes. "Maybe in five years, these people will be just as addicted to their e-cigarettes," Foulds said. "But based on the data that we have in this study, we got a significantly lower dependence score" than for conventional cigarettes. A spokeswoman for the American Lung Association said the study appears to be "legitimate, thorough and balanced." We also found a second study, published Feb. 1, 2015, in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, led by Jean-Francois Etter of the University of Geneva, which reached a similar conclusion based on survey data. Said the authors, "We found that e-cigarettes users were less addicted to e-cigarettes than smokers were addicted to tobacco cigarettes." A third survey-based study from 2013, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Review, found the same thing. Our ruling Dino Baccari said that a Penn State University study found that "electronic cigarettes … are far less addictive than cigarettes." He's not blowin' smoke. His characterization of the study's conclusion is accurate. But it's important to note that the conclusion is based on an open-to-anyone survey that relied on the recall of e-cigarette users who may have a natural bias toward reporting that the products they've chosen to use are less addicting than the cigarettes they're trying to avoid. Comparable studies support that conclusion. With the limitations in the methodology, we would characterize the statement as accurate, but in need of clarification or additional information, which we classify as Mostly True.

pomt-07281	On whether he would vote for the budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/23/scott-brown/did-scott-brown-flip-flop-supporting-paul-ryans-bu/	The budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- which would make deep spending cuts, hold the line on taxes and significantly change Medicare for those younger than 55 -- has become a key battleground between the two parties. The plan won passage in the House, with almost all Republicans and no Democrats voting for it. But Democrats have made the dangers of Ryan’s proposed changes to Medicare a major talking point, seeking to pin Republicans down on whether they support Ryan’s vision. First, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich prompted a media firestorm for seeming to change his position on the Ryan plan. We rated Gingrich’s position a Full Flop. Now, Sen. Scott Brown -- the Republican who won a special election in 2010 to fill the Massachusetts seat long held by the late Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy -- is attracting attention for his own possible flip-flop. According to the Newburyport Daily News -- a newspaper in northeastern Massachusetts -- Brown made reference to the Ryan plan during an annual luncheon of the Greater Newburyport Chamber of Commerce & Industry on May 13, 2011. "The leaders will bring forward (Ryan's) budget, and I will vote for it, and it will fail," Brown said. "Then the president will bring forward his budget, and it will fail. It will be great fodder for the commercials." Ten days later, Brown authored an op-ed in the political newspaper POLITICO that was headlined, "Why I don't back Paul Ryan's Medicare plan." "While I applaud Ryan for getting the conversation started, I cannot support his specific plan — and therefore will vote ‘no’ on his budget," Brown wrote. A "no" vote on the Ryan plan is considered safer for Brown. Massachusetts voters historically lean Democratic, and Republicans who win election are usually moderate. So in his Newburyport speech, Brown said he’d vote for the Ryan plan, while in his op-ed 10 days later, he said he’d vote against it. When we took these two comments to Brown’s press staff, spokesman Colin Reed said, "He was making the point in Newburyport that political games are being played in Washington, but was not commenting on the merits of the bill." We agree that in his Newburyport comment, Brown focuses on the gamesmanship of budget-writing in Washington rather than on the nitty-gritty of its policy details. Meanwhile, in the POLITICO column, Brown was careful to praise Ryan’s role in starting the "conversation" even as he declared opposition to his plan. These suggest a somewhat nuanced position. Still, Brown did indicate pretty clearly in Newburyport that he would cast a loyal GOP vote for the plan, even if he expected that the vote would ultimately prove fruitless. Then 10 days later, in the POLITICO op-ed, he made clear that he wasn’t just disappointed by the Ryan plan but would definitely vote "no." Anyone reading his comments in the Newburyport Daily News would be under the impression Brown was voting for the Ryan budget, but he's not. So we give Brown a Full Flop.

pomt-15356	On support for Trade Promotion Authority, called fast-track	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/08/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-changed-position-trade-promotion-authorit/	In a key Senate vote to advance President Barack Obama’s trade agenda, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, cast an unexpected vote that indicates he may have backtracked on fast-track. On June 23, 2015, Cruz voted against Trade Promotion Authority, also known as TPA or fast-track authority, which has been debated in Congress amid efforts by the Obama administration to secure the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with 11 other nations. The very same day as his no vote, Cruz published an op-ed to Breitbart explaining his decision. "TPA in this Congress has become enmeshed in corrupt Washington backroom dealings, along with serious concerns that it would open up the potential for sweeping changes in our laws that trade agreements do not typically include," he said. Cruz’s criticism of fast-track comes as a surprise, considering his public praise of the bill only two months prior. "We strongly urge our colleagues in Congress to vote for trade-promotion authority," Cruz stated, along with co-author Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on April 21. Given that Cruz is a GOP contender for president in the upcoming election, we decided to check how his position on fast-track registers in our Flip-O-Meter. It is important to note that we are not passing judgment on decisions to change positions. Rather, we are just determining whether he did. Cruz in support of TPA Trade Promotion Authority, called fast-track, has been enacted on and off since 1974. If passed, it has a life span of six years, and remains in place regardless of a presidential administration change. Fast-track grants the president freedom to present trade treaties for a straight up or down vote in Congress, freeing him or her from any amendments on trade deals. With negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the works, fast-track was introduced for reauthorization on April 16, 2015, and set to a late May vote in the Senate. In anticipation of this vote, Cruz publicly urged Congress to vote in favor of fast-track authority. "Congress needs to strengthen the country’s bargaining position by establishing trade-promotion authority, also known as TPA, which is an arrangement between Congress and the president for negotiating and considering trade agreements. In short, TPA is what U.S. negotiators need to win a fair deal for the American worker," Cruz and Ryan said in their Wall Street Journal op-ed. Cruz and Ryan also pitched the passage as an important step toward helping the domestic workforce. "TPA is what U.S. negotiators need to win a fair deal for the American worker," they said. "One in five American jobs depends on trade, and that share is only going to grow." On May 22, Trade Promotion Authority passed the Senate 62-37 with bipartisan support. Cruz was among the 48 Republicans and 14 Democrats who voted "yes." Cruz in opposition to TPA Following the Senate passage, the bill went to the House where it was split into two separate votes: one on TPA and the other on Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA (a program that provides training support, career counseling, allowances, and wage supplements to workers affected by globalization and trade). On June 12, fast-track passed, but Trade Adjustment Assistance was voted down. This stalled and resulted in a motion to reconsider by Speaker Boehner. In a procedural vote on June 23, the Senate passed fast-track once again, 60-38. But this time Cruz cast a "nay" vote. The same day, Cruz published his op-ed in Breitbart, a conservative news site, attributing his change of heart on TPA to "two material changes" in the legislation. First, he wrote, was the WikiLeaks reveal in June 2015 of the Trade in Services Agreement, or TiSA, which is intended to extend trade in services (as opposed to goods) to address changes and advances in technology since the last major services agreement was implemented in 1995. It is a key part of the trade agenda under negotiations; services include finance, insurance, transportation, telecommunications and other fields. Cruz wrote: "Despite the administration’s public assurances that it was not negotiating on immigration, several chapters of the TiSA draft posted online explicitly contained potential changes in federal immigration law. TPA would cover TiSA, and therefore these changes would presumably be subject to fast-track." Second, he said, were supposed "secret deals between Republican leadership and Democrats." "After witnessing several senators huddle on the floor the day of the TPA vote (on June 23), I suspected that to get their votes on TPA, Republican leadership had promised supporters of the Export-Import Bank a vote to reauthorize the bank before it winds down," he said."I cannot vote for TPA unless McConnell and Boehner both commit publicly to allow Ex-Im to expire -- and stay expired." Congress debated the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank prior to its expiration on June 30, 2015, and it was a topic of disagreement among GOP members. We asked several international trade experts about Cruz’s claims of undisclosed information about additions to TPA as justification for his switch, and at a minimum, they are in dispute. Gary Hufbauer, an expert in international trade and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics said, "Inclusion of TiSA under TPA was never a secret. Any immigration changes in TiSA will be limited to L visas (company transfers) and possibly H1-B visas, and be quite limited in number. So this excuse for the flip-flop has zero merit." "As for the Ex-Im Bank, Sen. Cantwell’s demand for its inclusion in the TAA-plus bill was rejected, though an eventual vote on Ex-Im was promised by the leadership. Again, nothing new there," added Hufbauer. (Cantwell is Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.) Hal Shapiro, a lawyer specializing in international trade practice, said "the TiSA disclosures by WikiLeaks would be an unusual reason for deciding on TPA." Hufbauer speculated that Cruz may have changed his vote on TPA to placate his tea party constituents, many of whom are adamantly opposed to TPP. When asked about the reason for his shift in position, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told us, "Sen. Cruz remains a strong supporter of free trade and fast-track." Politico and the Washington Post have also noted Cruz’s switch on trade. Our ruling Cruz was a supporter and voted in favor of TPA or fast-track when it was first put to a vote in May. Only a month later, Cruz issued an op-ed denouncing the additions of Export-Import Bank reauthorization and immigration laws, and then voted in opposition. His change of stance is well documented, and we rate his change of position a Full Flop.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2015-07-08T10:08:42	2015-06-23	['None']
pomt-03353	"In the 513 days between Trayvon dying, and today’s verdict, 11,106 African-Americans have been murdered by other African-Americans."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/jul/17/tweets/look-statistic-blacks-and-murder/	The acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, has prompted commentary from the left and right about race and murder statistics. We saw this statistic repeated multiple times by conservatives on Twitter after the July 13 verdict: "In the 513 days between Trayvon dying, and today’s verdict, 11,106 African-Americans have been murdered by other African-Americans." We will leave it up to others to interpret the relevance of such statistics in the Zimmerman trial or other cases. Our role here as fact-checkers is to examine the numbers and their context. A quick note on the case before we turn to the numbers: Hispanic is an ethnicity -- someone can be Hispanic and white, as in Zimmerman’s case -- or Hispanic and black. The crime data we reviewed generally focused on whites and blacks, though it sometimes included a generic "other" category. Martin, 17, was unarmed when he got into a scuffle with Zimmerman in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012. A jury acquitted Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer whose lawyer argued self-defense, of second-degree murder and manslaughter. (Read our fact-checks that relate to the case and Florida’s "stand your ground" law.) Statistic about blacks killed during course of Trayvon case We found the claim about murders on the conservative soopermexican blog; it appears to have originated there. His blog walks readers through the math on getting to 11,106 deaths in 513 days. (We counted 503 days, not 513, but that’s a tiny quibble.) The blogger, citing an earlier blog post and The Blaze, stated that there were 8,000 to 9,000 African-Americans killed each year -- 93 percent of them by African-Americans. The numbers came from a 2007 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report, which stated that blacks were victims of 7,999 homicides in 2005 and said that 93 percent were killed by people who shared their race. (It wasn’t clear to us where the blogger’s 9,000 figure came from.) Using the number 8,500, that translated to 21.65 blacks murdered each day by other blacks. So the blogger came up with a mathematical formula: 21.65 times 513 days=11,106. That 8,500 figure seems high, though, especially if we look at more recent figures. The FBI reported for 2011 that 6,329 black people were murdered, for example. The blog post makes it sound as if the black-on-black murder rate is particularly significant, but we found similar high percentages for whites. The report also stated that 85 percent of white victims in single-victim and single-offender homicides were murdered by someone of their race. So that means the majority of black and white people are murdered by someone of their own race. In 2005, there were 8,017 white homicide victims. (Editor's note, May 21, 2015: We have since collected statistics on additional years and published those findings in a more recent report.) The race victim/offender data isn’t shown for every case: It is only shown in the cases in which the race was known (some murders are never solved) and in cases involving a single victim and defendant. We sent a summary of our findings to the soopermexican blogger. "I think your criticism of the number I arrived at has some merit," he wrote in an email. "I should have made it more clear that is the best extrapolation from the numbers that are available. While the FBI stats don't include all known cases, I don't see why the cases where race stats are known shouldn't be representative of the entire class of murders. Yes, it's true that murder rates have come down generally, which I'm pretty sure applies to all race/ethnic classes." As for white-on-white homicides also representing a high percentage, he said the point he was trying to make is that it’s wrong to suggest that "white racism is killing blacks disproportionately." What homicide-race stats show about our relationships So statistics show that most murders in which the race can be measured are intraracial. We wanted to know why. We interviewed Professor David M. Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. "Homicides overwhelmingly happen among people who know each other," he said. "There are relatively few absolutely straight-up stranger homicides. Homicide is a phenomenon of social networks. ... Most peoples’ relationships are primarily with someone of their own race or ethnicity. As long as anybody has studied homicide, this has been the pattern." (See the historical data.) Writer Jamelle Bouie in The Daily Beast wrote a response to conservatives who have been trying to shift the conversation to black-on-black crime while ignoring that the same shared racial identity holds true for white-on-white crime, too. Bouie wrote that what is missing from the conversation about crime is that "it’s driven by opportunism and proximity; If African-Americans are more likely to be robbed, or injured, or killed by other African-Americans, it’s because they tend to live in the same neighborhoods as each other. Residential statistics bear this out (PDF); blacks are still more likely to live near each other or other minority groups than they are to whites. And of course, the reverse holds as well—whites are much more likely to live near other whites than they are to minorities and African-Americans in particular." Our ruling In response to the Zimmerman case, social media repeated this claim: "In the 513 days between Trayvon dying, and today’s verdict, 11,106 African-Americans have been murdered by other African-Americans." Some who are citing this statistic are using it to portray race as an overemphasized point in the Zimmerman trial. We’re not evaluating that opinion; we’re fact-checking the math based on the available data. The number sounds extremely precise, but it's actually something of a rough guess based on back-of-the envelope math. No one actually knows how many African-Americans were murdered by other African-Americans in that time frame, and the numbers cited are actually an extrapolation of murder statistics for 2005. More current figures from 2011 show fewer deaths. So the specific numbers are not literally accurate. Also, this claim lacks important context. Yes, it’s true that the majority of black murder victims are murdered by blacks, but the same holds true for whites: Most whites are murdered by whites. And in both cases, this race statistic is not available for all murders, but only ones where the race of both perpetrator and victim can be determined. The claim contains an element of truth, but it's not fully accurate. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/06b1b587-1ded-44e0-9c4a-0b54004a2d80	None	Tweets	None	None	None	2013-07-17T14:20:40	2013-07-14	['African_American']
pomt-14194	"Dolphins are rapists. Look it up."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/apr/22/unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt/dolphins-rapists-unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt/	If your spirit animal is a dolphin, you may want to think about changing spirit animals. At least that’s what Dr. Andrea Bayden, a psychiatrist played by Tina Fey on Netflix’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, would have you believe. Netflix released the second season of the show — which follows happy-go lucky former cult member Kimmy Schmidt played by Ellie Kemper — on April 15. In the ninth episode, Schmidt meets a drunk Bayden, who tells Schmidt her sleep cycle is erratic. "You know who else doesn’t sleep a lot?" Schmidt replied. "Dolphins. And they’re always smiling." Not so fast, Bayden said: "Dolphins are rapists. Look it up." Yes, yes, this is a fictional show. But people wondered if the line was more than a joke. And quite honestly, so did we. (If you hate fun, we have plenty of fact-checks about tax policy you can read.) As it turns out, this is somewhat of an urban legend. Research has shown that dolphins sometimes exhibit somewhat aggressive behavior in their mating practices, but it’s not fair to call it rape. Females are strong as hell The myth largely emerged from research conducted on bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, said Janet Mann, vice provost for research and a biology professor at Georgetown University. Mann, who worked on the Shark Bay research, said male bottlenose dolphins form alliances with two to four other males, and these groups will consort with a single female, and mating occurs. Often, the males will be aggressive toward the female and attack males outside of the alliance that attempt to get near or steal the female. But the female can avoid mating with a particular male by turning away, or she can go belly up at the surface to avoid mating at all. There’s no evidence to show that the males force the females to mate, said Richard Connor, a biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who has also worked on Shark Bay dolphin research. It’s possible they intimidate the females, but that’s unproven. Connor added that researchers think female dolphins try to mate with a number of different males, to confuse the issue of paternity and reduce the risk of infanticide. So they may actually want to mate with the males that herd them. "Males force the females to stay with them, but (there’s) no evidence of forced copulation," Connor said. "People are making a leap, perhaps because they have not considered that females may want to mate with as many males as possible." In a 2013 blog post debunking the dolphin-rape myth, dolphin behavior expert Justin Gregg noted that there are also rumors that dolphins rape humans. While there might be isolated incidents of dolphins with erections around humans or thrusting toward them, this is not rape. It’s unclear whether the dolphins actually want to mate or if it’s another form of social behavior, Gregg said. "Calling any of this behavior rape trivializes the word rape," Gregg wrote. "It either downplays the horrific human behavior of rape by jokingly misapplying it to quirky animal behavior, or unnecessarily vilifies what is, for dolphins, a diverse catalog of behaviors that might not cause the dolphins involved very much stress, and might even be consensual 100 percent of the time." Gregg, a big Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt fan, told PolitiFact he wouldn’t be surprised if Fey and the show’s other writers know that the dolphins-as-rapists meme is not actually true. "Either way, if it gets people Googling the concept and reading up on why it’s not really accurate to describe dolphins as rapists, all the better," he said. Our ruling Tina Fey’s character on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt said, "Dolphins are rapists. Look it up." We did. It’s just a myth. While research has shown some aggressive mating behavior among dolphin males, this isn’t the same thing as "rape." Importantly, there’s no evidence to show that the females are forced to mate. We looked it up and found that this claim is very much breakable. False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8057807-878d-4fca-b029-1f01fa7a7516	None	Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt	None	None	None	2016-04-22T17:05:57	2016-04-15	['None']
pomt-06416	"In Texas, we created over 1 million new jobs while the rest of the nation lost over 2 million."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/26/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-we-created-1-million-new-jobs-whil/	In a TV ad targeted at voters in Iowa, Texas Gov. Rick says he'll create at least 2.5 million jobs as president. "And I know something about that," Perry says. "In Texas, we created over 1 million new jobs while the rest of the nation lost over 2 million." Perry aired a similar claim at the top of the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Reagan presidential library in California after NBC News anchor Brian Williams asked whether Texas, with its poverty rates and highest-in-the-nation share of minimum-wage workers, is the "kind of answer Americans are looking for." "Actually, what Americans are looking for is someone who can get this country working again," Perry replied. "And we put the model in place in the state of Texas. When you look at what we have done over the last decade, we created 1 million jobs in the state of Texas. At the same time, America lost 2.5 million." We dug into Perry’s statement in a September fact-check, rating his claim Half True. Without question, Texas has enjoyed phenomenal job growth over most of the time Perry has been governor, though how much came because of his leadership — or any state-level actions — is debatable. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney hinted as much in the Sept. 7 debate, saying: "Texas is a great state. Texas has zero income tax. Texas has a right-to-work state, a Republican Legislature, a Republican Supreme Court. Texas has a lot of oil and gas in the ground. Those are wonderful things, but Gov. Perry doesn't believe that he created those things." In a post-debate interview, economist Thomas Saving, director of Texas A&M University’s Private Enterprise Research Center, told us that Texas has relatively low state debt and endured less of a housing bubble than many states. Still, he said, the state's economy might have been strong over the past decade regardless of who was governor. Pia Orrenius, an economist for the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve Bank, told us in a June interview that the Texas economy has been roaring since 1990. "Long before Rick Perry" became governor, she said, "we were talking about the great Texas economy. There are so many exciting things about the Texas economy that precede any political flavor of the month." She listed as favorable factors the state's range of natural resources, its energy and high-tech sectors, its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China. Also, we recognize that job-gain claims can overreach. An example: Perry’s January 2009 claim that about 70 percent of the U.S. jobs created between November 2007 and November 2008 were in Texas. We rated that claim False because the percentage was based on comparing new jobs in Texas with new jobs in 13 other states and the District of Columbia where job gains outnumbered losses; it ignored jobs created in 36 states where job losses overall outnumbered gains. Back to 2011: Perry’s campaign said in an Oct. 26 press release that the jobs statement in his Iowa ad is based on a comparison of the change in the number of Texas' nonfarm jobs during Perry's tenure as governor with the change in the rest of the nation. In December 2000, when Perry became governor, Texas had 9.5 million jobs while the other 49 states and the District of Columbia had 123.0 million. And in September 2011, Texas had 10.6 million jobs while the rest of the country had 120.6 million. That means Texas had 1.1 million more jobs in September than it did in late 2000, while the rest of the country had 2.4 million fewer jobs. So, Texas ended up with a lot more jobs than before, and other states, together, had even more net job losses. Specifically, Texas was among more than 20 states with net job gains in the period, while more than 25 states ended up with net job losses. In raw numbers, the net job losers were topped by Michigan and California, which together accounted for about 1.3 million fewer jobs. Michigan experienced the nation's greatest percentage slide, more than 15 percent. Conversely, while Texas had by far the greatest raw job gain, its 11.2 percent growth rate for the period was less than the percentage increases for Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. With its 21.2 percent increase, North Dakota led the nation, followed closely by Wyoming and its 21.1 percent jump. Lee McPheters, director of the Economic Outlook Center at Arizona State University, earlier told us by email that it's natural that the most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — would generate big raw job gains and losses. It's also crucial to notice the time period being analyzed, he said. For instance, Florida outpaced Texas in job growth from 2000 to 2007, he said, but then lost jobs for three years. Texas experienced steady job losses in a shorter period, from late 2008 through 2009. He wrote: "So the difference is in the recent years, where states such as Florida and California dropped out of the job growth derby while Texas continued to add jobs in 2010 and into 2011." So, how does Perry's comparison stand up? At a glance, it reflects the health of the Texas economy in his time as governor and the state's perpetual outsize significance in terms of raw job counts. Yet there's also a meaningful weakness in such a comparison. The governor of any state with net job gains in the period over the past decade could make a similar declaration, leaving the misimpression that only their state gained jobs while the rest of the country lost jobs. In this vein, for instance, Arizona could boast that it created 144,800 jobs while the rest of America lost 1.5 million. Left out of this formulation is that 20-plus other states also had job gains. Also, the Texas economy was rocking before Perry became governor. And most of each state’s economic circumstances — in Texas' case, no state personal income tax and vast natural resources, for starters — aren't controlled by the governor. We rate Perry's statement Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-10-26T14:36:35	2011-10-26	['Texas']
pomt-04680	Says Mitt Romney asked for a waiver from federal welfare rules.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/rahm-emanuel/rahm-emanuel-says-romney-asked-welfare-work-waiver/	Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff, jumped into the fray over welfare work requirements during an appearance Sunday on Meet the Press. Emanuel also served as a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton during welfare reform in 1996. The reform law transformed welfare from an indefinite entitlement to temporary assistance that required people to eventually join the workforce. That’s what the changes Obama announced this summer are also aimed at, Emanuel said, by giving states flexibility in how they move welfare recipients into employment. The work rule reforms, Emanuel said, "have one goal: work. Fifty different creative ways to achieve it. Gov. Romney asked for, actually, a waiver. But you had to make sure your plan for Massachusetts, which is different than Mississippi or Alabama's or California's, achieves the goal of work. And it was every governor, regardless of party, who wanted to be creative in their own way to achieve this single goal. And that is exactly how it's supposed to work," Emanuel said in the Sept. 2, 2012, appearance. Emanuel’s statement is somewhat garbled by the mixing the past (Romney’s one term as governor as Massachusetts) with the present (the changes announced by Obama this summer). But a fuller transcript of Emanuel’s comments make it fairly clear that he is accusing Romney of being hypocritical -- namely, of attacking Obama for changes to the welfare law that Romney himself once advocated. But Emanuel’s statement went one step further -- saying Romney specifically asked for a waiver like ones Obama proposed. Is that true? First, some background Welfare erupted as an issue in the presidential campaign in August, when the Romney campaign released an ad accusing Obama of gutting the work requirement in welfare reform. "Under Obama’s plan, you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check," the Romney ad said. We looked into the claim and rated it Pants On Fire. The changes Obama sought don’t eliminate the work requirement but instead give states the ability to test different programs for helping residents move toward work. (They first have to have approval of their programs from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.) A July memo from HHS specified several times that any states seeking waivers must show that employment will grow under their pilot programs. Romney’s letter We did not hear back from Emanuel or the Democratic National Committee about this claim. But we suspect it’s related to a 2005 letter that Romney and 28 other Republican governors signed in support of legislation to extend the welfare reform law. The governors wrote that an extension was needed so they could effectively implement welfare block grants in their states, and they emphasized the positive aspects of a bill being considered in the Senate known as the PRIDE Act. Those included a stable funding stream, support for abstinence education, child care and, mostly notably "increased waiver authority." "The Senate bill provides states with the flexibility to manage their (grant) programs effectively and serve low-income populations. Increased waiver authority, allowable work activities, availability of partial work credit and the ability to coordinate state programs are all important aspects of moving recipients from welfare to work," the letter states. That sounds a lot like what the Obama administration has outlined in its memo about state waivers. But it’s not exactly a request for a waiver in Massachusetts. What about Massachusetts? We delved back into news coverage from 2005 and 2006 to look for any mention of Romney requesting a waiver for his state. We found he was doing something nearly opposite of that. In 1995, the year before federal welfare reform passed, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted state reform. When federal reform passed the next year, Massachusetts received a waiver exempting it from federal welfare rules. (Keep in mind, Romney was not governor at this time.) Here’s the Boston Globe’s report on it from the time: "Like the federal law, the Bay State's law includes time limits and work requirements: Recipients who are not exempt are limited to 24 months of assistance in any five-year period and must work between 20 hours and 30 hours a week, depending on the age of their youngest child. With its waiver, Massachusetts continues to receive federal money, which it supplements with state tax dollars." In general, the federal rules were tougher than Massachusetts’, so the state was having to ratchet up its requirements in order to get in compliance. In late 2004, a state advisory panel came up with a set of recommendations. Romney, by then in his second year as governor, offered his own outline -- and what he proposed exceeded the panel’s ideas and the federal law’s requirements. He sought to roughly double the number of Massachusetts welfare recipients who have to work, "eliminating exemptions for pregnant women in the third trimester, mothers with children between 1 and 2 years old, and about 5,600 people who are considered disabled under state standards but not under federal ones. His plan also would impose work requirements on recipients caring for a disabled relative and teenagers in school," a story in the Globe said. Ultimately, the state Legislature took no final action to overhaul welfare. The fact remains, however, that Romney not only didn’t seek a waiver from HHS, he pushed for tougher work demands in his state. Our ruling Emanuel said on Meet the Press that Romney sought a state waiver for meeting federal welfare work requirements. As governor of Massachusetts, Romney signed onto a letter supporting a bill to extend the federal welfare reform law. That letter urged greater state flexibility and increased waiver authority, which adds grist to the charge Romney is being hypocritical in attacking Obama now for gutting work requirements. It also indicates he supported the principle allowing states some waiver authority. But Emanuel’s words were "Romney asked for, actually, a waiver," and that is not true. Emanuel stretched the meaning of the 2005 letter signed by Romney and other governors, fabricating a waiver request that never existed. The claim omits critical facts and creates an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Rahm Emanuel	None	None	None	2012-09-06T19:41:32	2012-09-02	['None']
pomt-14232	"When this campaign began, I said that we’ve got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/15/bernie-sanders/does-hillary-clinton-want-15-or-12-minimum-wage/	Does Hillary Clinton think the federal minimum wage should be $12 an hour or $15? This question produced one of the more heated back-and-forths in an April 14 Democratic presidential debate between Clinton and opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders — starting when Clinton asserted that she has continuously supported the Fight for $15 advocacy campaign. "I have supported the Fight for $15," Clinton said. "I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the Fight for $15." To Sanders, that was news. "I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour," Sanders said. "When this campaign began, I said that we’ve got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12." An extended back-and-forth followed. We’re putting Sanders’ claim on the Truth-O-Meter. He’s right that Clinton’s official position is to raise the national minimum wage to $12 as a floor. However, she has also shown support for the Fight for $15 campaign that pushes for higher minimums in individual states and cities. Here’s what Clinton’s website says on that point: "Hillary believes we are long overdue in raising the minimum wage. She has supported raising the federal minimum wage to $12, and believes that we should go further than the federal minimum through state and local efforts, and workers organizing and bargaining for higher wages, such as the Fight for $15 and recent efforts in Los Angeles and New York to raise their minimum wage to $15." In June 2015, early on in her campaign, Clinton spoke with a gathering of Fight for $15 members via phone and told them she supported their campaign. "All of you should not have to march in the streets to get a living wage, but thank you for marching in the streets to get that living wage," she said, according to the Washington Post. A few days later, Clinton delivered a campaign kickoff speech in which she called for raising the minimum wage, but she did not specify a number. Her support for the $12 minimum wage proposal seems to have emerged around July 2015, when she praised legislation proposed by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., arguing that it would be more politically feasible. "Let’s not just do it for the sake of having a higher number out there," she said, according to the New York Times. "But let’s get behind a proposal that actually has a chance of succeeding." By November, Clinton had started to say plainly that she prefers a $12 federal minimum wage. In the same month, though, she tweeted with the hashtag #FightFor15. What about Sanders? He’s right that he has advocated specifically for a $15 minimum wage since his campaign began. "Let us be honest and acknowledge that millions of Americans are now working for totally inadequate wages," he said as part of his May 2015 announcement. "The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised. The minimum wage must become a living wage, which means raising it to $15 an hour over the next few years." A couple months earlier, in March 2015, he put forward an amendment to eventually raise the minimum wage to $15. He also put forth legislation in July 2015. Our ruling Sanders said, "When this campaign began, I said that we’ve got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12." Since the start of his campaign, Sanders has advocated for a $15 minimum wage. Since early on in her campaign, Clinton has supported the Fight for $15’s efforts in individual cities and states. But her official position is that she prefers a $12 federal minimum wage as a floor, allowing cities and states to go further. Sanders’ has a point that he is calling for a federal minimum wage that would be $3 more an hour than what Clinton says she favors. However, he misses the nuance that Clinton is also supportive of local efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15. We rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c08e34bc-e615-4605-84d8-f2637305f291	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-15T00:12:43	2016-04-15	['Bill_Clinton']
pomt-10924	"Pre-K has gone down since the current mayor took office."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/jul/29/dorothy-brown/no-chicagos-pre-k-program-not-decline/	Mayor Rahm Emanuel has long made improving early-childhood education a cornerstone of his agenda. In 2013, his administration made universal full-day kindergarten a reality. Since then, he has pushed to expand access to pre-kindergarten as well. And this spring, he announced plans for achieving free, full-day pre-K for all four-year-olds by 2021. So it caught our attention when Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown, one of a large crop of potential candidates looking to challenge the mayor in next year’s city election, declared preschool in Chicago has slipped under Emanuel’s watch. "We need to have a funded pre-K," Brown said during a WGN radio interview. "Pre-K has gone down since the current mayor took office. By the time children get to the first grade, they’re already behind if they have not had pre-K." Brown’s provocative statement offered little by way of context and left a number of questions hanging. Did she mean preschool funding had decreased? That enrollment had fallen? Or was she suggesting the program overall was spiraling? We decided to check. A numbers argument A spokeswoman for Brown’s campaign said Brown was referring to overall pre-K enrollment figures and pointed us to a Chicago Teachers Union press release published in May following Emanuel’s announcement that he plans to roll out universal full-day preschool for all four-year-olds. The CTU, a longtime adversary of the mayor’s, blasted Emanuel for allowing enrollment to slip by 18 percent since taking office. Indeed, there were 19,441 preschoolers enrolled at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year—4,264 fewer than there were in the 2010-11 school year at the tail end of which Emanuel became mayor. But while the CTU—and Brown by extension—are correct about the pre-K enrollment decrease, that decline alone doesn’t necessarily prove her broader point that CPS’ preschool program is headed in the wrong direction under Emanuel. For one thing, enrollment throughout the district has declined overall in recent years, meaning some drop in the number of preschool students isn’t surprising. Quantity vs. quality More importantly, though, focusing on that enrollment decrease alone doesn’t account for a significant—and positive—change in Chicago’s preschool landscape that has occurred since Emanuel took office in 2011. Back then, full-day pre-K programs run by the district were virtually nonexistent, according to Arthur Reynolds, an early-education expert at the University of Minnesota who has studied full-day preschool in Chicago. The increase in the number of spaces available inside full-day preschool classrooms since 2012 is "enormous," Reynolds wrote in an email. "Now this is the model for the city." Indeed, full-day public pre-K slots have risen by roughly 75 percent since Emanuel took office, according to the city. A spokeswoman for the mayor’s office also noted that spots in such programs are now in greater demand than those in part-day programs. "Under Mayor Emanuel’s leadership, Chicago has shifted its approach to offer as many full-day opportunities as possible, because research shows that they provide a stronger academic foundation for children and better meet the needs of working families," spokeswoman Lauren Markowitz wrote in an email. In pursuing that goal, Markowitz said, CPS has increased the total number of full-day seats in Chicago's public pre-K programs from about 10,000 in 2011 to more than 17,500 today. Those figures include approximately 10,000 full-day seats available annually at district-authorized community-based organizations. Prior to Emanuel’s first term, full-day programs run directly by CPS were almost nonexistent. Full-day and half-day So what’s with the decrease? In order to ramp up the number of full-day spots, Markowitz explained, CPS has converted some classrooms that served two half-day sessions into full-day ones, which reduces the number of kids served at those locations by half. They’ve been adding new full-day classes too, though not at a rate fast enough to counteract the overall decline in capacity at CPS-operated programs, which pencils out to about 14 percent. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But many education experts agree, as the mayor’s office contends, that the benefits of high-quality, full-day preschool programs are worth investing in, even though overall enrollment may fall in the process. In a 2014 study of children attending preschool at child-parent centers that serve low-income communities in Chicago, for instance, Reynolds and his colleagues found full-day preschool was associated with higher levels of school readiness and better attendance than half-day programs. In light of the research guiding the mayor’s plan, we followed up with Brown to clarify her stance on full-day preschool expansion. Her spokeswoman sent a statement from the candidate that attempted to have it both ways. "Any decrease in the numbers of our children able to access high-quality early educational options is unacceptable," Brown’s statement said. "I am supportive of full-day preschool because it will set the bar for their entire educational experience." Our ruling While knocking Emanuel’s education record, Brown said "pre-K has gone down since the current mayor took office." When we sought clarity, her campaign pointed to a decline in preschool enrollment during Emanuel’s tenure. Brown’s correct on that count, but the number of enrolled preschoolers isn’t the best way to assess the overall health of Chicago’s pre-K programming. First, the district’s population as a whole has dropped during that period, likely contributing to that decrease. Second, available spots in full-day preschool programs have increased by 75 percent under Emanuel, and many parents are snapping them up. As part of that expansion process, some part-day classrooms have been converted to full-day ones, cutting the total number of students those rooms can serve. But research supports investing in full-day preschool programming, especially for lower-income children, because it helps better prepare them for school. Brown’s campaign pointed us to numbers that are technically accurate but don’t tell the full story. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-11113	Says "our indicted Attorney General Ken Paxton is back to being the only statewide official in the country under indictment."	true	/texas/statements/2018/jun/07/justin-nelson/justin-nelson-ken-paxton-only-indicted-statewide-o/	The Austin lawyer nominated by Democrats for state attorney general saw big-as-Texas significance in Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens announcing plans to resign. Justin Nelson said in a tweet posted the day that Greitens announced he’d resign on June 1, 2018: "The Missouri Governor under indictment just quit. This means our Indicted Attorney General Ken Paxton is back to being the only statewide official in the country under indictment. Texans can make their decision to fire Indicted Ken Paxton in November." Greitens, a Republican, revealed he’d resign weeks after being charged with felony computer tampering for allegedly using a list of donors to his charity, The Mission Continues, to raise campaign donations. As recapped by St. Louis Public Radio, that indictment occurred after KMOV-TV reported that the governor had had an extramarital affair and had allegedly taken a photo of the woman without her consent while she was bound and semi-nude. The governor, the woman said, then threatened to make the picture public if she talked about it. See Greitens’ resignation letter here. Paxton, a former state legislator running for a second term as Texas attorney general, was indicted on charges of securities fraud in the summer of 2015 though the case has been mired in a dispute over how much several appointed prosecutors will be paid. So, does Greitens’ move make Paxton the only statewide official in the U.S. under indictment? Nelson campaign says it found no one else We inquired into how Nelson reached his conclusion. By email, Sean Haynes of his campaign provided a spreadsheet listing statewide elected positions in all the states and followed up with a campaign document that Haynes said shows web searches conducted for indicted statewide officials in the 50 states. Over several months, Haynes said by phone, Nelson and campaign aides searched online for news reports or other indications of indictments of state officials before concluding that aside from Paxton and Greitens, no statewide elected officials were under indictment. The document indicates specific searches for the word "indicted" and the names of officials in each state across 14 job categories, starting with governor. Yanked charges in Oklahoma, Arizona Along with Paxton, the document indicates, an Oklahoma official was under indictment in 2016-17. Joy Hofmeister, Oklahoma’s elected state superintendent of public instruction, was indicted in November 2016 for allegedly raising campaign donations illegally and coordinating attack ads against her predecessor before the 2014 Republican primary, the Associated Press reported. But those felony charges were dropped Aug. 1, 2017, according to a news story in the Oklahoman. That story also quoted Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater saying the charges might be restored, "pending further investigation." Haynes also pointed out an August 2017 arrest in Arizona leading Joe Hart, Arizona’s elected mine inspector, to be accused of domestic violence after a fight with his nephew, the Arizona Republic reported. We followed up with the Kingman, Ariz., police department whose deputy chief, Rusty Cooper, replied by email that the misdemeanor charge against Hart was later dismissed by the city attorney’s office. Nobody tracks statewide officials under indictment Next, we searched for indictments of statewide officials in news stories compiled by the Nexis news database in 2017-18--and found no indications of indicted statewide officials beyond Paxton. We also reached out to the Associated Press, Governing magazine, the Almanac of American Politics and entities including the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Council of State Governments, the Center for Public Integrity, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the Institute for Corruption Studies at Illinois State University. No one said its researchers tracked indicted officials across the land. Our inquiries otherwise turned up a statewide elected official recently acquitted of criminal charges and another perhaps at risk of more scrutiny. CNN reported in January 2018 that after U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., was acquitted of charges alleging Menendez had accepted bribes in return for political favors, the Justice Department planned to seek dismissal of remaining charges against him. That dismissal happened Jan. 31, 2018, according to a legal document emailed to us by Haynes. An AP editor, Tom Verdin, responded to us by noting that a federal judge in April 2018 found Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, in contempt of court for failing to carry out the court’s orders in an elections matter. Perhaps Kobach is in hot water. Still, the AP’s news story on that finding by U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson quotes Moriah Day, a spokeswoman for Kobach’s campaign for governor, saying the secretary of state’s office would appeal Robinson’s decision. Matt Welch, a spokesman for Paxton's campaign, had no comment on Nelson's claim. Our ruling Nelson tweeted that Paxton, his November foe, "is back to being the only statewide official in the country under indictment." We didn’t find an authoritative database or research effort bearing out this statement. But interviews of experts and searches of news stories using the Nexis database didn’t yield contradictory information. We rate this claim True.

pomt-10013	"Senator Chris Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, placed an amendment in the ‘stimulus’ bill that allowed for banks bailed out with taxpayer money — including AIG — to hand out huge bonuses."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/20/national-republican-senatorial-committee/Dodd-failed-to-halt-bailout-bonuses/	With public outrage festering over AIG’s huge bonuses, Republicans are pointing the finger at Sen. Chris Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat. Dodd has received more campaign contributions from AIG than any other elected official, and he helped draft parts of the stimulus bill having to do with executive compensation. His involvement included inserting an amendment that allowed AIG to dole out its bonuses, National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director Rob Jesmer alleged in a fundraising e-mail on March 18. Jesmer's committee helps elect Republicans to the U.S. Senate, and Dodd is in a dead heat in a hypothetical matchup with potential Republican challenger Rob Simmons in 2010. "Sen. Chris Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, placed an amendment in the 'stimulus' bill that allowed for banks bailed out with taxpayer money — including AIG — to hand out huge bonuses without any government oversight or regulation, as long as those bonuses were issued before February 11," the e-mail said. "AIG did just that, paying out $165 million in taxpayer-funded bonuses." AIG was among the financial firms that suffered immense losses lately, largely as a result of writing trillions of dollars worth of "credit-default swaps," a type of investment insurance, that it could not honor. In September, Congress and President Bush pledged an $85 billion loan to help AIG, saying a failure there would cause a financial meltdown. By November the pledge had increased to $150 billion. The Federal Reserve and Bush’s Treasury Department negotiated the terms, which did not include a ban on bonuses. In March, the Obama administration promised tens of billions more. Most estimates have the total federal aid to AIG at about $170 billion, more bailout money than any other company has received in the $700 billion bank bailout, known as the Troubled Assets Relief Program. As the government started to cut all these checks, the public began to realize that bankers at Merrill Lynch and elsewhere were using bailout money to pay bonuses. Congress belatedly tried to do something about that this year. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, was among those leading the effort. In February, when Congress was working on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus bill, Dodd inserted an amendment sharply limiting executive bonuses at companies that received bailout money in 2008. However, before the bill was voted into law, Dodd’s amendment was changed to apply only to bonuses contained in contracts after Feb. 11, 2009. Thus, AIG was able in March to pay $165 million in bonuses for last year to executives in its financial products division, the very unit that caused such turmoil in the company and the financial system as a whole. Dodd initially insisted he was not the one that changed his amendment. "There’s a suggestion today being made that you received more money from AIG than any other senator and that you are responsible for the Feb. 11, 2009, date," a CNN producer said to Dodd on March 17. "You’re saying you had nothing to do with that date?" "Absolutely not," Dodd replied. A day later, Dodd changed his story. "I apologize, I had some confusion about whether or not we wrote it exactly," he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on March 18. "But I didn’t write it at my own behest. I was being sought out and asked to modify this, with the alternative, quite candidly, being losing the amendment itself." He said staff members from the Treasury Department had asked him to make the change, but he did not name the staffers. A separate amendment that would have restricted bonuses, proposed by Sens. Ron Wyden and Olympia Snowe, was removed entirely from the bill behind closed doors. It is not yet clear which lawmakers did that, and whether Dodd was involved. Clearly, though, the charge by the National Republican Senatorial Committee refers to Dodd’s own amendment — claiming it "allowed for banks bailed out with taxpayer money ... to hand out huge bonuses." That's not true in this sense: The bankers would have been allowed to hand out the bonuses even without Dodd's amendment. In fact, they would have been allowed to continue doing so in the future. Dodd’s amendment did not enable bonus-paying that would not have existed otherwise. Quite the contrary: It limited bonuses, albeit in a way that fell short of public expectations. The Republicans’ charge is true in a limited sense — Dodd’s amendment did address the bonus issue while falling short of disallowing the recent AIG bonuses. It is fair for Republicans to call attention to Dodd's loosening his amendment, and to ask why he did so. We find this claim Half True.

pomt-15333	"We know from ... the federal data, that they only stop or apprehend one out of four illegal people crossing our border."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/14/jan-brewer/former-arizona-gov-jan-brewer-only-1-4-people-tryi/	Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer came to the defense of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, suggesting Trump’s controversial claims about illegal immigrants bringing "crime" and being "rapists" aren’t necessarily off the mark. Brewer, who championed tough immigration laws in Arizona, said on CNN that studies and research showing no distinguishable rise in crime among illegal immigrants are wrong. "I find it interesting that people … 1,000 miles away can rely on whatever statistics they want to rely on," Brewer said. "But if you come to Arizona and you talk to people that live on the border, you talk to people that live in Arizona, you will find that, you know, the facts are not true. "We know from their data, from the federal data, that they (border patrols) only stop or apprehend one out of four illegal people crossing our border," Brewer said. PunditFact decided to find out if this fact istrue. We reached out to Brewer to see if she could provide us with the "federal data" she was looking at, and also to clarify what she meant by "our" border -- did she mean the Arizona border, the border states, or the entire U.S. border? But we did not hear back. In the absence of an answer from Brewer, PunditFact looked around for available federal data that could support Brewer’s claim. First, we mapped out all U.S. Border Patrol sectors. The majority, of course, are found along the Southwest border of the United States. According to 2014 data from the U.S. Border Patrol, this area was responsible for about 98.5 percent of all apprehensions. A similar breakdown is evident in previous years as well. In total, there were 479,371 apprehensions were made along the Southwest border in 2014. According to Brewer, that means about 1.4 million illegal immigrants weren’t stopped and were able to cross into the country. Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center, found that number high. " ‘Conventional wisdom’ (in the 1980s-1990s) used to be that 1 in 3 was caught," Passel said. "Since then, the Border Patrol has increased significantly; there are miles and miles of fences; substantial technology has been deployed. It seems unreasonable to think that they apprehend a smaller fraction." And even still, the 1 in 3 figure was at best a rough estimate, Passel said. The government did not seem to keep a record of the effectiveness of Border Patrol apprehensions in the 1980s and 1990s, and since then, that trend has only mildly improved. The recent data The most recent data PunditFact could find dated back to 2011 and included a lot of caveats. The U.S. Government Accountability Office published data about the effectiveness of the Border Patrol at various stations in the Southwest sector from 2006-11. The government measures "apprehensions," "turn backs" and "got aways." Here is a chart printed by the Washington Post that summarizes that data: In short, according to the Government Accountability Office, 84 percent of people trying to cross the Southwestern border in FY 2011 were either apprehended or ran back to Mexico. Only 16 percent "got away," meaning they presumably made it into the United States. You can go through the numbers for yourself in more detail, but in no way do they support the idea that three in four illegal immigrants crossing the border makes it to the United States. It’s no better if you specifically focus on Brewer’s home state of Arizona. Looking at sectors covering the Arizona border (Tucson and Yuma), patrols apprehended 64 percent and 74 percent of border crossers respectively. In both cases, another 20 percent of people turned back to Mexico -- meaning only between 6 and 13 percent of people made it across the border successfully. Limits of the data Obviously, counting the number of people who managed to avoid detection is a tricky business. According to the 2012 GAO report, "indications of illegal crossings are obtained through various sources such as direct agent observation, referrals from credible sources (such as residents), camera monitoring, and detection of physical evidence left on the environment from animal or human crossings." The "detection of physical evidence left on the environment" is known as "sign-cutting." It includes searching for evidence such as "dusty footprints, torn cobwebs, broken twigs, (and) overturned pebbles." Of the 85,467 people who "got away" across the Southwest border in 2011, about 83 percent of them were identified using "sign-cutting." The accuracy of "sign-cutting" is debated. In one 2013 article published in the Huffington Post, Border Patrol Chief Mike Fisher said that sign-cutting "is not an exact science." On the other hand, Border Patrol agent Richard Gordon, who uses sign-cutting frequently, appears to trust the method. "It's tried, and it's true, and it works," said Gordon in the same article. Both "turn backs" and "got aways" use sign-cutting as a source of information. Another problem with the numbers may be caused by data overlap. According to the 2012 GAO report, sometimes there could be "cases where the same turn back (or "got away") identified by a camera is also identified by sign-cutting. Double counting may also occur when agents in one zone record as a got away an individual who is (later) apprehended and then reported as an apprehension in another zone." Because of this, "Border Patrol headquarters officials said that while they consider turn back and got away data sufficiently reliable to assess each sector’s progress toward border security … they do not consider the data sufficiently reliable to compare -- or externally report -- results across sectors." Border Patrol agents also seem to disagree about some of the published statistics. "Ask any line agent in the field and he or she will tell you that at best we apprehend 35-40 percent of the illegal immigrants attempting to cross," said Border Patrol agent Chris Cabrera in a Breitbart.com article. Our ruling Brewer said that, based on federal data, "they only stop or apprehend one out of four illegal people crossing our border." The federal data doesn’t support that. According to the Government Accountability Office, 61 percent of people trying to cross the Southwestern border in FY 2011 (the last year available) were apprehended and another 23 percent were stopped and ran back to Mexico. Only 16 percent "got away," meaning they presumably made it into the United States. It’s obviously hard to know the real numbers with certainty given the nature of the topic, but Brewer erroneously pointed to federal data that does not back her up. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-03381	Says Ohio budget item later signed into law by Gov. John Kasich requires women seeking an abortion to undergo a "mandatory vaginal probe."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2013/jul/09/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-ohio-budget-includes-requiremen/	Ohio’s new operating budget calls for $62 billion in spending over two years and several abortion restrictions, including one that requires patients seeking one to first undergo an ultrasound. And while Democrats are plenty upset about the economics of the plan that Republican Gov. John Kasich ratified on June 30, they sense a political opening on the women’s issues. Viewers of MSNBC’s "The Rachel Maddow Show" recently got a preview of the heated rhetoric that will typify this debate over the next 16 months as Kasich seeks a second term. Maddow, the cable news program’s liberal host, noted on her June 28 broadcast the anti-abortion measures the GOP-controlled General Assembly had added to the budget, which Kasich had yet to sign. In interpreting some of the budget’s more-ambiguous abortion language, Maddow contended that the new regulations included a "mandatory vaginal probe at the insistence of the state." Maddow was referring to a new requirement that women seeking abortions first receive ultrasounds to determine whether a fetal heartbeat is present. Her provocative words quickly went viral and sent PolitiFact Ohio in search of a full copy of the massive state budget. Did it go as far as she claimed? Did it mandate a transvaginal ultrasound, as Maddow claimed, or did it allow for an external transabdominal procedure? We found our answer in the new Section 2919.191 that with the budget’s approval is now part of Ohio Revised Code. Division A of that section says that before performing an abortion, a provider must "determine whether there is a detectable fetal heartbeat of the unborn human individual the pregnant woman is carrying." The method for detecting a heartbeat is then spelled out in Division C, which says: The director of health may promulgate rules pursuant to section 111.15 of the Revised Code specifying the appropriate methods of performing an examination for the presence of a fetal heartbeat of an unborn individual based on standard medical practice. The rules shall require only that an examination shall be performed externally. In other words, not only are external methods such as transabdominal ultrasounds allowed under the new law; they are required. That sinks Maddow’s claim of a "mandatory vaginal probe." We reached out to MSNBC and asked representatives if Maddow had anything more to say, but we did not hear back from them. Because Maddow is an opinion leader on the left, others ran with her claim. The Raw Story, which describes itself as a progressive news website, called attention to the Maddow segment in a June 29 post. And on Twitter, several users seemed to parrot Maddow in tweets at Kasich. "Nothing says Small Government like a mandated trans vaginal ultra sound," read one tweet. "Ohio Gov @JohnKasich just ended his re-election chance, by signing into law mandatory big-government-forced object-rape of pregnant women," tweeted another critic. Abortion is a hot-button issue in politics. And with Kasich up for re-election next year, it’s no surprise that Democrats are eager for a debate that draws contrasts with the governor. But there should be no debate about what types of ultrasounds these new regulations require. Had Maddow read the language closely, she would have seen a mandate -- for external detection methods. That puts Maddow’s "vaginal probe" claim about as far as can be from the truth, into the realm of the ridiculous. Or, in Truth-O-Meter terms: Pants on Fire!

pomt-07571	Georgia public sector employees do not have a say in the conditions of their employment, do not have bargaining rights or a say in their working conditions.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/30/calvine-rollins/unions-have-little-bargaining-power-georgia-group-/	In recent weeks, elected officials and workers in several states have battled over issues such as collective bargaining and reducing employee pension and health care costs as state governments struggle to balance their budgets. In Georgia, there’s been little debate of such matters. Protesters aren’t sleeping in the state Capitol, as was the case in Wisconsin. But there has been some conversation about labor issues here in the Peach State. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently published two divergent viewpoints on whether public sector employees should have collective-bargaining rights. Calvine Rollins, president of the Georgia Association of Educators, argued they should. Here’s the line that piqued our interest: "In Georgia, public sector employees don’t have a say in the conditions of their employment. We don’t have the right to bargain our contracts, negotiate our benefits or have a say in our working conditions." Do government employees in Georgia have that little say? Georgia is a "right-to-work" state, meaning unions and businesses cannot force employees to join or financially support a union. The Georgia Legislature passed such guidelines in 1947. We thought we’d break down each part of Rollins’ claim. First, do public sector employees have a say in the conditions of their employment? GAE officials told us that teachers cannot negotiate salaries, benefits or class sizes. The Georgia Attorney General’s Office sent us a 1973 opinion, 73:56, on whether Fulton County’s Department of Family and Children Services can, in part, discuss working conditions or personnel policies with a union representing some of the employees. "While state employees are prohibited from striking, they have the right to express complaints or opinions relating to the conditions of their employment," the opinion said. The opinion also says "there is no prohibition from the [DFCS] board having discussions with their employees or representatives on appropriate subjects." GAE officials argue the statute merely gives employees the right to speak out to their supervisors about employment issues, but not a real conversation. "There is no negotiation there," GAE spokesman Kevin Pearson said. Let’s examine the next part of Rollins’ statement: "We don’t have the right to bargain our contracts." The attorney general opinion says the state and counties do not have to engage in collective bargaining. Georgia Code section 20-2-989 says collective bargaining is a no-no for teachers. "Nothing in this part shall be construed to permit or foster collective bargaining as part of the state rules or local unit of administration policies," the statute says. "Employees in general do not have a lot of job protection," said Kristine Orr Brown, an employment attorney who has worked for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators. So what about the last part? Do public sector employees have a say in their working conditions? Brown disagreed. She told us teachers and public sector employees can seek recourse for problems with their working conditions, particularly racial or gender discrimination, by filing a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Ben Mathis, an attorney who represents local governments and private employers, also disagreed with Rollins. He said employees can file grievance complaints. Mathis also said they have constitutional protections to publicly complain about working conditions that private sector workers do not enjoy. "You’re taking a very complex issue and making a general statement," said Mathis, who has worked for school systems in Cobb, Douglas and Hall counties. Pearson said Rollins was referring to issues such as class size when discussing working conditions. He said teachers have no say in such matters. "That’s a realistic working condition for teachers," Pearson said. "We have no control over class size." So where does this leave us? The 1973 opinion from the attorney general’s office does give employees an avenue to discuss the conditions of their employment, so we have issues with the first part of Rollins’ comments. Georgia code and that opinion say state and local governments do not have to engage in collective bargaining, so we believe Rollins is right when she said employees can’t bargain their contracts. The experts we spoke with about the third part of her statement disagreed with Rollins that public sector employees do not have a say in working conditions. It’s apparent that employees can speak out about working conditions, particularly under EEOC laws. It seems that the GAE has a point that employees may have little influence when they raise concerns about working conditions. Rollins was trying to make a point that teachers and other public sector employees have trouble addressing their grievances and negotiating the terms of their employment with their bosses. But as Mathis suggested, it could have been more detailed. One part of her statement was correct, the other two had deep holes in them. Her statement lacked some critical details, and under our guidelines, that rates as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Calvine Rollins	None	None	None	2011-03-30T06:00:00	2011-02-27	['None']
pomt-01674	Under Mayor Tom Barrett, the number of Milwaukee police officers "has not increased."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/18/bob-donovan/bob-donovan-says-no-net-gain-police-officers-under/	Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan, a candidate for mayor in 2016, worries that upcoming retirements could further reduce what he sees as an undersized police force under Mayor Tom Barrett. In his ‘state of the city’ speech Feb. 24, 2014, Barrett noted he had added 120 new officers in his 2014 budget. Donovan hit on that number when interviewed in the wake of his mayoral announcement. "The reality is the number of officers has not increased," Donovan said during a July 29, 2014 appearance on the Charlie Sykes show on WTMJ-AM. "Now the mayor will continue to say we’re hiring 120 cops this year. That doesn’t take into consideration the fact that we’ve had 150 retirements, or that we haven’t filled positions going way back." When we asked Donovan about the comment, he did not cite hard numbers, but told us he figures unfilled positions and retirements have outstripped the addition of recruits over the 10 years Barrett has been in office. Is Donovan right? Has police strength -- at least by the numbers -- been flat or gone down on Barrett’s watch? To answer that question, we turned to the city’s Fire and Police Commission, which issues an annual report that details the size of the overall force. To be sure, the actual number of bodies on the force on any given date is constantly changing, since retirement dates vary while recruit classes mean a wave of new bodies joins the force at once. The Fire and Police Commission reports, available online, are as close to an official tally of police strength as we found. They list, by race and gender, the number of persons on the Police Department payroll as of the last pay period of each year. The latest covers 2012, so we obtained figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 directly from the commission. We used 2004 as the pre-Barrett baseline for our comparisons, because Barrett didn’t take office until spring 2004 and therefore did not propose the budget for that year. All figures factor in retirements, terminations and new hires. Police officers At the end of 2004, 1,402 police officers were on the payroll. That number fell to 1,357 by the end of 2013, a 3 percent drop. By that measure -- the one the public sees -- Donovan is correct that officer strength "has not increased." Barrett administration officials note it can be misleading to look only at strength of force at any one point in time. A new class of officer recruits came on line in late 2004, boosting the number, they said. A comparison of pay period one in 2004 to the same period in 2014, for example, actually shows a small increase in officer strength. A better measure than point in time comparisons, they said, is average strength across the whole year. That was 1,349 in 2004, they said, and based on the first half of 2014 it’s 1,341 now -- a smaller decline. Still, that approach does not change the accuracy of Donovan’s claim. Total sworn officers City officials often will refer to this larger figure when discussing "officer strength," and Donovan did as well when we contacted him. It includes not only patrol officers but detectives, supervisors, various technicians and specialists as well as the police chief and the top command staff. At the end of 2004, the figures show 2,006 sworn officers were on board. That number fell to 1,828 by late 2013 and to 1,875 by mid-July 2014. Earlier in 2004, according to Barrett’s budget staff, the figure was 1,932. And Barrett’s office released figures using the average strength throughout the year that show a smaller drop in overall sworn strength. Again, those figures change the angle of descent, but not the downward direction of the trend. Within those numbers, the detective ranks fell by more than one fourth. So by this broader measure, Donovan is on target again. Ten-year trend The staff strength figures from the Fire and Police Commission show that the police officer ranks grew early in Barrett’s tenure, but have slipped gradually with one exception since then. Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 P.O.s* 1,402 1,362 1,390 1,441 1,406 1,392 1,362 1,348 1,384 1,357 1,345** *Sources: Fire and Police Commission, from Milwaukee Police Department payroll reports. **As of July 2014 As for the broader sworn ranks, a similar trend is evident. By way of explaining the lack of growth in the police force, Barrett chief of staff Patrick Curley and city budget officials said state shared-revenue aid to Milwaukee has dropped by $25 million since 2004 while the police budget is $65 million higher. They said the department under Chief Edward Flynn has re-deployed officers from administrative tasks to community policing. That was accomplished by hiring more civilians to do those desk jobs, they said. Efficiencies have helped avoid layoffs seen in some big cities, Barrett spokeswoman Jodie Tabak said. The Barrett officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin that our inquiry for this fact check led the mayor to quickly unveil a proposal to add 15 more officers to a training class that will graduate in April 2015. It already had been under consideration to announce later this year, they said. The mayor will propose his 2015 budget in September. Our rating Donovan said the number of Milwaukee police officers "has not increased" under Mayor Tom Barrett. Donovan’s claim is on target because reports from the city’s Fire and Police Commission indicate a decline in the number of officers since 2004. And other measuring sticks offered by Barrett’s office show the same trend. We rate Donovan’s claim True.

pomt-14633	"Barack Obama, right now, No. 1, over seven years has dramatically degraded our military."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/28/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-barack-obama-has-dramatically-degrad/	During the Republican debate on Fox News, Sen. Ted Cruz portrayed President Barack Obama as weak on military spending amid the battle against ISIS and terrorism. "Barack Obama right now, No. 1, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military. You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war," the Texas senator said. "When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000. When that war began, we had 529 ships. Today, we have 272." Has Obama slashed the military during his tenure? We found that Congress shoulders a good deal of the responsibility, and Obama has actually asked for larger increases than Congress approved. A Cruz spokesman declined to respond on debate night. Military spending under Obama It is a common talking point among Republican candidates to portray the United States’ military spending as weak during Obama’s administration. They argue that the cuts, known as sequestration, make it harder for the United States to battle terrorists. PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims related to the military budget as well as whether our Navy and Army are shrinking. We will recap our earlier findings here. Spending on national security includes the Pentagon budget as well as other agencies, such as the Energy Department’s work on nuclear weapons. Spending increased in 2010 and 2011, but it has fallen every year for four years since then by a cumulative 15 percent. Other ways of looking at the question show declines as well. National security spending made up 20.1 percent of the federal budget in 2010, but in 2015 it was 15.9 percent. Over the same period, spending fell from 4.6 percent of gross domestic product to 3.3 percent. There are two main reasons for the spending drop. The first is the Obama administration’s decision to start removing U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. The second has to do with a process known as sequestration. Sequestration refers to automatic, across-the-board cuts to both military and nonmilitary spending that were originally designed to force bipartisan negotiators in Congress to strike a deal in 2011. Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward’s book The Price of Politics showed that defense sequestration was an idea that came out of Obama’s White House. But the intention was to force Republicans to negotiate, not to actually put the cuts into effect. But negotiations fell apart, so the cuts went into effect. The bipartisan nature of the sequestration provision means that both parties merit a share of the blame, experts say. The most recent Obama budget proposed a 7.8 percent increase in the base Defense Department budget between 2015 and 2016. The spending bill enacted this fall puts the defense budget on a path to start growing in fiscal year 2016, up about 6 percent from the previous year. "For five years in a row, Congress enacted a defense budget that was less than President Obama requested," said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told PolitiFact the night of the debate. "So I don’t think it’s accurate to pin the blame on the president for reductions in defense spending." Army, Navy and military equipment Another way to look at Cruz’s statement is by the size of military services and the status of military equipment. Army: In 2012, the Army had about 570,000 soldiers. Reductions over several years have taken it down to its current size of about 490,000. In July, the Army said that it plans to cut the regular Army from 490,000 to 450,000 by fiscal year 2018, or a total of 40,000 positions. ‎As of early December, 1,299 soldier positions have been cut. The new cuts, which are scheduled to end by October 2018, will save about $7 billion. It’s unclear if all the planned cuts will occur and some experts argue we only need a larger Army if we are going to reoccupy Iraq or invade and occupy other countries. Navy: It’s a popular talking point about the United States having the "smallest Navy" in almost a century. In 1916, the U.S. Navy had 245 active ships. The number peaked at a massive 6,768 ships during World War II. Then the number drifted down during most of the 20th century, with slight upticks during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. As of Dec. 9, 2015, the number of active ships stood at 272, which is the lowest since 1916. However, today’s ships are far more powerful than those of 100 years ago. Today’s ships are outfitted with more advanced technology than they were during World War I. And today, the U.S. Navy has certain types of ships capable of launching nuclear ballistic missiles that didn’t exist in 1916. In March 2015, the Navy set a goal of goal for a fleet of 308 ships though the earliest that could be met is 2022 if sequestration ends. New military equipment: The United States is building various military equipment including ballistic submarines and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, though there is debate among experts as to whether it is happening fast enough. Our ruling Cruz said, "Barack Obama, right now, No. 1, over seven years has dramatically degraded our military." It’s inaccurate for Cruz to solely fault Obama for budget cuts as a result of sequestration. Both Democrats and Republicans share the blame for the budget negotiations that fell apart. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth in that military spending has decreased, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-03338	"In his book, (Ken) Cuccinelli questions whether Medicare and Social Security should exist."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/jul/22/democratic-party-virginia/democrats-says-cuccinelli-whether-social-security-/	Democrats have been flipping through Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli’s book "The Last Line of Defense" in a bid to paint him as conservative extremist. The latest citation from the 2013 book comes from the Democratic Party of Virginia, which is airing a TV ad with Peggy Borgard, a Henrico County senior citizen, criticizing Cuccinelli’s views on entitlement programs. "In his book, Cuccinelli questions whether Medicare and Social Security should exist and said people are dependent on government," Borgard says. It seemed remarkable that any candidate would start an election year by writing a book questioning propriety of popular entitlement programs for senior citizens. That goes double for a gubernatorial candidate who, if elected, would have no influence over how the federal government runs Medicare and Social Security. So we looked into the Democrat’s claim. On screen, the ad cites as its source page 62 of the book. At the bottom of that page is a passage that has been a lightning rod for Democrats. "Sometimes bad politicians set out to grow government in order to increase their own power and influence," Cuccinelli wrote. This phenomenon doesn’t just happen in Washington; it happens at all levels of government. The amazing thing is that they often grow government without protest from citizens, and sometimes they even get buy-in from citizens -- at least from the ones getting the goodies." Cuccinelli then cites specific entitlements. "One of their favorite ways to increase their power is by creating programs that dispense subsidized government benefits, such as Medicare, Social Security and outright welfare (Medicaid, food stamps, subsidized housing and the like). These programs make people dependent on government. And once people are dependent, they feel they can’t afford to have the programs taken away, no matter how inefficient, poorly run or costly to the rest of society." That’s certainly not a ringing endorsement of the entitlement programs, which the Republican said are a tool leveraged by politicians to hold on to power. But does that mean Cuccinelli questions whether those entitlements should exist at all? Cuccinelli answered that question on pages 237 and 238, as first noted by our colleagues at FactCheck.org. Cuccinelli wrote that government spends little on investments that result in economic growth, noting that Social Security, Medicare and defense spending amounted to more than half of the federal budget in 2011. "There is no monetary return on these investments in any traditional business sense (that is, one invests money with a goal of getting a return in the form of interest, income or appreciation in value), although there are obviously other reasons America spends money on these programs," Cuccinelli wrote. "I’m not questioning here the existence of these programs nor the wisdom of how much money is spent on them. What I’m trying to illustrate is that most dollars that government spends do not create economic growth, but instead take money out of the hands of the people who do create economic growth." Again, Cuccinelli wrote, "I’m not questioning here the existence of these programs, nor how much money is spent on them." And on pages 74 and 75, Cuccinelli wrote Medicare and Social Security are indeed constitutional programs based on the government’s tax and spending authority. After the ad appeared, Cuccinelli issued a statement saying, "I have always believed programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are government services that should be maintained." Cuccinelli added that the social safety net programs should be "reformed" so they can be preserved for future generations. Brian Coy, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Virginia, stood by the ad’s statement. "On page 62 in the book he describes Social Security and Medicare as created by ‘bad politicians’ who ‘set out to grow government in order to increase their own power and influence,’" Coy wrote in an e-mail. "That statement clearly questions the foundations of those programs - why would he say they’re a big government ploy by bad politicians without questioning their existence?" Coy also defended the statement by pointing to a Cuccinelli interview with Politichicks.tv at a 2012 Tea Party rally. Cuccinelli said, "We have had one answer in federal government to every challenge in health care for 47 years, and that’s more government. It goes back to the beginning of Medicaid, Medicare and as Dr. Phil would say ‘How’s that working out for ya?’ We need to go the other way. We need to move back toward the free market." The Fact Checker at The Washington Post recently gave the ad three out of four possible Pinocchios, saying "while it is fair to say that Cuccinelli is skeptical of government-run social programs" and that he prefers free market solutions as part of any overhaul of those entitlements, that doesn’t mean he thinks that the programs should not exist. FactCheck.org found that the ad "goes too far." Finally, let’s return to Peggy Borgard, the senior citizen who narrated the ad. We left two messages for her and did not hear back. Borgard retired last year as administrator of a youth soccer league. She has contributed $1,770 to Democratic candidates and nothing to Republicans since 2004, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project. Our ruling The Democratic Party of Virginia says in a new ad that Cuccinelli, in his book, "questions whether Medicare and Social Security should exist." Cuccinelli gave the Democrats a tiny opening in writing that "bad politicians" have "tried to increase their power by creating programs that dispense subsidized government benefits, such as Medicare, Social Security" that make people "dependent on government." But ad goes overboard because it suggests Cuccinelli is questioning whether the entitlements should exist today and in the future. Cuccinelli specifically wrote in his book, "I am not questioning the existence of these programs, nor how much is spent on them." The Democrats ignored that key passage and we rate their claim Mostly False.	None	Democratic Party of Virginia	None	None	None	2013-07-22T12:00:00	2013-07-16	['Ken_Cuccinelli']
pomt-02465	The Ukraine Orange Revolution in 2004 "was the first color revolution."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/23/bill-kristol/bill-kristol-says-ukraines-2004-revolution-was-fir/	The violent uprising taking place in Ukraine and the decision of President Viktor Yanukovych to flee the nation’s capital of Kiev dominated much of the talk on the Sunday shows. On ABC’s This Week, conservative pundit and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol connected the recent events in Ukraine to the country’s November 2004 revolution against alleged electoral fraud. Kristol argued that the United States has a responsibility to help out nations like Ukraine more than they have in the past. "Ten years ago there was the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, it was the first color revolution in spite of other efforts around the world. … All honor to the people of the Ukraine," Kristol said. "That first revolution unfortunately slipped away. I think that’s partly our fault, the west Europeans’ fault. We didn’t do as much as we could have to help the newly democratic Ukraine." Whether or not the United States helped Ukraine enough a decade ago is a matter of opinion. But we can check Kristol’s assertion about the Orange Revolution and its place in history. Kristol didn’t return our request for comment. What is a color revolution? Eastern European uprisings have taken on many names. Czechoslovakia nonviolently overthrew its Communist government in 1989 in what was known as the Velvet Revolution. But the "color revolutions" speak to a more specific group of revolutions that came well after the original fall of Soviet Union, experts told us. They're associated with colors in a broad sense. "Color revolutions came to denote pro-western government coming to power in former Soviet republics," said Anton Fedyashin, a Soviet history professor at American University. "None of them have succeeded in the long run." Experts generally identify three color revolutions: Rose Revolution, Georgia, 2003 Orange Revolution, Ukraine, 2004 Tulip Revolution, Kyrgyzstan, 2005 The first color revolution took place in Georgia in November 2003, when Georgian protesters overthrew the government of Eduard Shevardnadze and elected 35-year-old U.S. educated Mikheil Saakashvili. (The name, Rose Revolution, comes from the flower, but it is considered a "color" revolution.) Ukraine’s Orange Revolution came a year later and ended when opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko was elected president. (Yuschenko defeated Yanukovych, Ukraine’s now-deposed leader.) The revolution was originally branded "orange" because that was Yuschenko’s signature campaign color. So Kristol was wrong when he said Ukraine’s revolution was first. But Donnacha Beacháin, a Dublin City University government professor who published a book on the color revolutions, did say Ukraine’s revolution attracted much more attention than Georgia’s due to the nation’s larger population. Our ruling Kristol said the Ukraine Orange Revolution "was the first color revolution." It was the biggest color revolution, but experts say nobody considers it the first. Georgia’s Rose Revolution took place a year earlier. We rate Kristol’s claim False. This item was updated at 6:51 p.m., Feb. 23, 2014, to note that the "color" revolutions speak more to a group of revolutions that have loose ties to colors -- than actual revolutions with colors in their names.

pomt-03176	A proposed San Antonio ordinance will allow men into women’s restrooms in the city.	false	/texas/statements/2013/sep/04/texas-values/san-antonio-ordinance-wont-allow-men-womens-restro/	"San Antonio Ordinance to Allow Men into Women’s Restrooms," says an Aug. 15, 2013, email from Texas Values, an Austin-based advocacy group that says it seeks to support "family values." The email and an Aug. 13, 2013, post on the group’s blog mentioned a new California law giving public school students access to either gender’s sports teams, locker rooms and bathrooms. The blog entry said the San Antonio City Council would soon consider a "similar policy" that "makes it illegal to deny ‘facilities’ because of a person’s ‘gender identity.’ These facilities are commonly understood to include bathrooms, locker rooms, and other changing facilities." Texas Values president Jonathan Saenz confirmed by phone that the group was referring to a proposed nondiscrimination ordinance that has been hotly debated in San Antonio with religious protests, an effort to recall the councilman who proposed it and 400 people showing up to speak at an Aug. 28, 2013, council meeting. The San Antonio Spurs basketball team and Austin Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett have lent their support to the ordinance; gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott and other politicians have weighed in opposing it. The proposal has a broader scope than bathrooms. According to a July 25, 2013, San Antonio Express-News news blog entry, it would consolidate the city’s "hodgepodge" of anti-discrimination policies and add protection for sexual orientation, gender identity and veteran status. PolitiFact Texas wrote about the proposal’s employment protections in a July 26, 2013, fact-check. The council will hear more public comment Sept. 4 and is set to consider the ordinance Sept. 5. Saenz said his group was referring to Section 2-592 in an Aug. 7, 2013, draft of the ordinance, which said: A place of public accommodation, the draft said, is any business in San Antonio that’s open to the general public and offers products, services or facilities in return for payment. Among the examples it gives: stores, theaters, bars, restaurants, hospitals, museums and golf courses. The city issued a revised draft Aug. 28, 2013, that did not change the wording of Section 2-592 but added below it, "Nothing herein shall be construed as directing any policy or practice regarding the use of restrooms, shower rooms, or similar facilities which have been designated for use by persons of the opposite sex." According to Councilman Diego Bernal, who spearheaded the proposal, neither version would have addressed who could enter which restroom. Rather, he told us by phone, both would protect people from being turned away entirely -- not allowed to use any restroom at all -- based on their gender identity. We unsuccessfully sought comment from the City of San Antonio’s communications office and city attorney’s office on whether the ordinance would "allow men into women’s restrooms." Spokeswoman Diedrie Brewton of the city attorney’s office, speaking to us by phone Aug. 30, pointed us to a fact sheet posted in the "last week" on the city’s homepage, www.sanantonio.gov, which says the proposal does "not change any bathroom, dressing room or locker room policies currently in place." Bernal pointed us to an Aug. 15, 2013, opinion column by Express-News commentator Brian Chasnoff, who wrote that according to city attorney Michael Bernard, because of an appeals court ruling that applies to Bexar County, "if the proposal passes, a business owner in San Antonio would still have the right to stop someone from going into a bathroom — regardless of that person's gender identity." So the official view appears to be that places open to the public will still be able to prevent men from entering women’s restrooms, or vice versa. Saenz disagreed, saying, "What the councilman says and what the city attorney says doesn’t say how it will be used." Courts will decide how the ordinance is carried out, he said. Transgender groups’ swift opposition to the Aug. 28 revision bolsters that view, Saenz said, because their reaction made it clear they expected the ordinance would let them use the restrooms of their choice. Spokesman Michael Diviesti of GetEqualTX, an education and advocacy group that started a petition protesting the ordinance’s revisions, told us by phone that by specifying bathroom policies would remain unchanged, the Aug. 28 version effectively stripped protection that the Aug. 7 draft offered to transgendered people. Executive director Katrina Stewart of the Transgender Education Network of Texas, an advocacy and education group whose online fact sheet about the proposal was sent to us by Saenz, told us by phone that Texas Values’ statement was false for a different reason: "Because transgender women don’t identify as men," she said. "They identify as women." Separately, Diviesti said the same. Overall, Stewart said, the ordinance would not create significant change. "The truth is, there are a large number of transgender people that have been working in San Antonio just fine, and using the restrooms," she said. "For the vast majority of trans people, we just want to go in, go to the bathroom, wash our hands and leave." Diviesti said that there’s no state law governing bathrooms’ gender designation, so "it’s currently up to business owners" to say who can use which restroom. Ryan Kellus Turner, general counsel for the Texas Municipal Courts Education Center, also told us by phone there is no Texas law specifically saying whether men or women can enter bathrooms designated for the opposite gender, though other states and some cities have created ordinances addressing such access. Houston’s municipal code makes it a misdemeanor to enter without permission a public restroom designated for the opposite gender "in a manner calculated to cause a disturbance." City employees, under executive orders issued by Mayor Annise Parker in 2010, can "use restroom facilities in city-owned buildings for the gender with which they identify," according to an April 2, 2010, Houston Chronicle news story. Saenz said that antidiscrimination policies in other places indicate how San Antonio’s could be applied, citing a 2012 incident in which Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., protected the right of a transgender student who was biologically male to use women’s facilities after a girl saw the student nude in a locker room. Allowing men into women’s facilities via such policies has "happened in other states; it will happen in San Antonio as well," he said. The American Civil Liberties Union said April 24, 2013, on its website that while some jurisdictions across the U.S. have specified that denying transgender people access to the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity is discrimination, courts have also ruled the other way. A Dallas ordinance protects against discrimination based on sexual orientation at public accommodations’ facilities citywide; similar ordinances in Austin, El Paso and Fort Worth include gender identity as well. Dallas County protects county employees from discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. Our ruling Texas Values’ email said, "San Antonio Ordinance to Allow Men into Women’s Restrooms." We found nothing in law that says San Antonio men can’t go into women’s restrooms now, or vice versa. The City of San Antonio and the councilman who proposed the measure said it won’t change any bathroom policies that are now in place. The city attorney said in a newspaper commentary that an appeals court decision means a San Antonio business owner would still be able to prevent someone from entering a bathroom, regardless of that person’s gender identity.

pomt-12721	Says Whoopi Goldberg said the widow of a Navy SEAL was "looking for attention."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/07/undergroundnewsreportcom/whoopi-golberg-quote-about-navy-seal-widow-made/	A fake news story about Whoopi Goldberg allegedly condemning the widow of a slain Navy SEAL elicited such vitriol, the author says it led him to decide to stop posting on his website. A March 1, 2017, post on UndergroundNewsReport.com said Goldberg excoriated Carryn Owens, the wife of William "Ryan" Owens, a SEAL killed during a Jan. 29 raid in Yemen. President Donald Trump pointed out Carryn Owens in the gallery during his speech before Congress on Feb. 28. The UndergroundNewsReport.com article doesn’t mention the Owens family by name, but it does use a fabricated quote from Goldberg. "She was just looking for attention. These military widows love their 15 minutes in the spotlight," Goldberg is quoted as saying. "If it were me I wouldn’t be able to leave the house. How can someone who is truly grieving go out there and be on TV. It just doesn’t make sense to me" As part of its efforts to eliminate fake news in users’ news feeds, Facebook alerted us that the story might be made up — and it is. The author of the story told PunditFact that every story on UndergroundNewsReport.com is bogus. James McDaniel, who told us that he is an American who lives in Costa Rica, said he made them up first as a joke, then used them to try and rile Trump supporters who believed the articles without verifying them. The site contains a disclaimer that says all articles "are fiction, and presumably fake news." There currently is a link at the end of the story that redirects readers to an explanation that the website is trying to fool its readers. As of this writing, the Goldberg story had 348 comments, and had been shared on Facebook well over 56,000 times. The same story has popped up on other sites that have copied it, with no indication that it is fake. The entire experiment was never meant to be serious, McDaniel said, but he decided to quit posting new articles once he saw how far-reaching his fabrications had become online. "I might have carried on a bit longer because I was having fun, but people took the Whoopi Goldberg story so seriously and it had gotten so big I thought I had better pull the plug," McDaniel wrote via email.

pomt-09910	"Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/07/barack-obama/obama-says-californians-use-40-percent-less-energy/	President Barack Obama says California is a role model for energy conservation. In a June 29, 2009, speech to promote new light bulb efficiency standards, Obama said energy conservation will produce big results in the future, and cited California as an example. "In the late 1970s, the state of California enacted tougher energy-efficiency policies. Over the next three decades, those policies helped create almost 1.5 million jobs. And today, Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average — which, over time, has prevented the need to build at least 24 new power plants." That paragraph is chock-full of claims to check, but for now, we're going to focus on the key point of Obama's statement: that because of long-standing energy efficiency standards, "Californians consume 40 percent less energy per person than the national average." The White House provided us with a 2008 report written by David Roland-Holst at the University of California-Berkeley to back up Obama's claim. It said that Californians' electricity consumption is 40 percent below the national average. Had Obama specified electricity, he would have been correct. California's low electricity consumption is widely known. More than three decades ago, the state adopted building and appliance efficiency standards, and it required that electricity profits be separate from the amount of energy sold. This prompted utilities to offer incentives to consumers who save energy. Indeed, since the mid 70s, the amount of electricity used per person has grown by almost 50 percent in the rest of the country while California’s numbers remained relatively flat. For example, in 2006, electricity use in the entire country hovered around 12,000 kilowatt hours per person, while California's was approximately 7,000 kilowatt hours, according to a 2007 report by the the California Energy Commission, a branch of the state government. That's about 40 percent less than the national average. But Obama said "energy," which includes other sources in addition to electricity, so that is what we are checking. Our first stop was the Energy Information Agency, where we found that overall energy consumption per person in California is quite low. In 2006, individuals there used about 232 million Btu of energy, which includes natural gas, petroleum and coal. The state's level was about 30 percent less than the national average of 333 Btu, which ranked the state 47th in the nation. Statemaster.com, a database that compares states by demographics and economics, shows a similar pattern based on statistics from 2001; then, California ranked 46th in per capita energy consumption. So Obama is correct with his underlying point that California's energy efficiency measures have reduced consumption dramatically, but he is off target with his statistic. It's actually 30 percent lower, not 40 percent as he said. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-07-07T15:42:36	2009-06-29	['None']
pomt-04647	"The Senate has not passed a budget in more than three years, not a good budget, not a bad budget, no budget."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/12/leonard-lance/congressman-leonard-lance-claims-us-senate-has-not/	In more than three years, the U.S. Senate has not passed a good budget or a bad budget -- it hasn’t passed any budget at all, according to U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance. The Republican congressman made that point during a recent TV interview in response to a question regarding the budget proposal put forth by Wisconsin congressman and Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan. "I think it’s an honest proposal and Paul Ryan would be an adult at the table regarding issues of importance, including preserving Medicare," Lance said in a Sept. 5 interview on NJToday. "The Senate has not passed a budget in more than three years, not a good budget, not a bad budget, no budget." The federal government has continued to spend money, but Lance is right that the Senate has not passed a "budget resolution" in more than three years. That resolution represents the congressional budget plan, serving as a blueprint for federal fiscal policies. Our PolitiFact colleagues have fact-checked similar claims before and, depending on the wording, those statements have landed at different points on the Truth-O-Meter. First, let’s explain more about the congressional budget process. The House and Senate are supposed to adopt a budget resolution that covers the upcoming fiscal year and at least the following four fiscal years. By itself, a budget resolution does not actually spend money, but instead serves as the framework for appropriations bills and other subsequent legislation dealing with budgetary matters. The federal government doesn’t shut down in the absence of a budget resolution, since Congress has taken other steps to spend money and set certain budgetary guidelines. Still, not adopting a budget resolution means Congress has not fulfilled its duties as part of the official budget process to lay out a plan for future budgetary decisions. To back up Lance’s claim, his chief of staff, Todd Mitchell, pointed out in an e-mail how the Senate last passed a budget resolution on April 29, 2009. A report by the Congressional Research Service confirms Mitchell’s point. On that date, the House and Senate adopted a budget resolution for fiscal year 2010, marking the last such plan approved by Congress. The Senate has not passed budget resolutions for fiscal years 2011, 2012 or 2013. The GOP-controlled House passed budget resolutions for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, but they were rejected by the Democrat-led Senate. Fiscal year 2013 starts Oct. 1. But the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has countered that the Budget Control Act of 2011 is meant to serve as the budget for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Enacted in August 2011, that legislation included provisions to raise the nation's debt ceiling and also set caps on certain types of future discretionary spending for 10 years. "I just say to you, a budget is a limitation on spending. The Budget Control Act contained very clear limitations on spending for 2012 and 2013. So when our friends say there’s been no budget passed by this body, oh yes, there has," Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND), the committee chairman, said Monday on the Senate floor. "There’s been a budget passed for 2012, one for 2013. Instead of a resolution, it was done in a law." However, while the Budget Control Act includes some features of a budget resolution, it lacks others, according to federal budget experts. William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said in an e-mail that "a completed budget is expected to do much more than set spending levels for discretionary programs." "By that standard, the congressman is correct," Galston added, referring to Lance. "The 2011 BCA kept the government open, but it didn’t constitute a full budget." Roy Meyers, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, agreed in an e-mail: "The BCA is not a budget: a plan for the use of the government's financial resources." Our ruling In a TV interview, Lance claimed: "The Senate has not passed a budget in more than three years, not a good budget, not a bad budget, no budget." The congressman’s claim is solid, given that the Senate has not passed a budget resolution since April 29, 2009. Congress has taken other steps to spend federal dollars and set certain budgetary guidelines, but that resolution represents a plan to guide future budgetary decisions. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12137	"Dwayne 'The Rock' (Johnson) Has Officially Filed For The 2020 Presidential Campaign"	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/14/rearfrontcom/did-dwayne-rock-johnson-officially-file-run-presid/	It’s never too early on social media to stir up interest about the next presidential election in 2020 -- especially if the buzz features a potential candidate who’s a bona fide celebrity. On Aug. 9, Rearfront.com -- a viral-content website that describes itself as a "powerhouse of generating awesomeness" -- posted an item headlined about former pro wrestler and popular actor Dwayne Johnson, sometimes known as "the Rock." It said: "Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Has Officially Filed For The 2020 Presidential Campaign And Twitter Is Already Going Crazy." Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. The post had attracted 16,700 views through Aug. 11. So we decided to take a closer look. As it turns out, the headline and some of the text in the article offered a garbled account of what had actually happened. Johnson, reportedly an independent, has indeed flirted with making a presidential run in 2020, though it remains to be seen how serious his is about a bid. In May, when he hosted the season finale of NBC’s Saturday Night Live, Johnson joined with fellow actor Tom Hanks under a large banner reading "Johnson Hanks 2020" as confetti flooded the stage. Johnson talked about the growing buzz about a candidacy with GQ writer Caity Weaver in June 2017. Weaver wrote: "Johnson doesn't hesitate when I ask him whether he honestly might one day give up his life as the highest-paid movie star on earth — which is unquestionably easier, more fun, and more lucrative than being president of the United States — in order to run for office. 'I think that it's a real possibility,’ he says solemnly." Then someone took it seriously and filed papers with the Federal Election Commission -- but contrary to the Rearfront.com article, it wasn’t Johnson. On July 9, Kenton Tilford of Wheeling, W. Va., filed paperwork to formally establish "Run The Rock 2020." It is what’s known as a draft committee -- an organization created "solely to draft an individual or to encourage him or her to become a candidate for federal office," according to the Federal Election Commission. The paperwork says that the committee supports "only one candidate … Dwayne Douglas Johnson." Where the Rearfront.com item gets it wrong is when it says that Johnson himself has "officially filed" as a 2020 presidential candidate. That is flatly wrong. The paperwork itself clarifies Run the Rock 2020 "is NOT an Authorized Committee," meaning that it was not established by the candidate being supported. The Run the Rock 2020 website offers T-shirts for $20.20 to fund its grassroots effort. Tilford confirmed to PolitiFact that the Rearfront.com post "is indeed incorrect." "I have not been in touch with Mr. Johnson or his representatives," Tilford told PolitiFact. "I'm simply a private citizen who formed a draft committee to rally like-minded people around the goal of encouraging him to run. As far as I know, Mr. Johnson and his representatives have not commented on the matter. We filed paperwork with the FEC because we hope to raise money and develop a real presence to show him the energy on the ground for his candidacy." That explanation squares with what Tilford had earlier told several other news outlets that he has not talked to Johnson himself. According to his LinkedIn page, Tilford graduated from Knox College in 2012 and has worked on campaigns in New Jersey and Louisiana. He was also a field organizer for Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign in Clayton County, Iowa. We did not hear back from two representatives of Johnson’s camp. As for the headline’s message that The Rock is locked in for 2020, we rate that statement False.

pomt-14019	"The vast majority of minimum wage workers get a raise within a year."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/jun/02/nfederation-o-independent-business-virginia/nfib-says-vast-majority-minimum-wage-workers-get-r/	Minimum-wage jobs may not be the dead-end they’re portrayed to be, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. "The vast majority of minimum wage workers get a raise within a year," says an infographic posted on the website of the Virginia chapter of the small business lobby. We emailed Nicole Riley, state director for the federation in Virginia, to see what that claim was based on. We heard back from Todd Pack, a federation spokesman for the group. Pack pointed us to a 2004 report by the Employment Policies Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank. That study crunched U.S. Census Bureau data looking at the earnings of workers from 1979 to 2002. It examined how a minimum-wage worker’s pay in one year compared to the following year. Its conclusion: "Over the 23 years of data studied in the report, nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage employees who continue employment are earning more than the minimum wage within 1–12 months," the report says. We’ll note that passage includes the qualifier that it focuses on minimum wage workers who continue working. Some low-wage workers may leave the workforce or become unemployed before they get a pay bump. Still, the report’s conclusion says minimum-wage employees get a pay bump based on their hard work and hence "Nearly two-thirds receive a raise within a year of starting employment." One issue with the Employment Policies Institute report is its age. It looks at a time period that ended in 2002. That’s 14 years ago and five years before the Great Recession started to grip the U.S. A more recent study examined this question. Researchers at Texas A&M University revisited the issue as part of a broad look at the minimum wage and its effect on employment in a 2013 paper. They studied Census Bureau data from 1979 through 2012 in which minimum-wage workers were asked about their earnings in an initial survey and again in a second interview a year later. The researchers found that among all minimum-wage workers, 16.55 percent of them left the labor force within a year and didn’t try to find a new jobs, and another 5.85 percent became unemployed but sought new work. Among those who remained employed, 65.85 percent were paid more than the minimum wage in the following year. The median higher pay for those workers was an additional $1 an hour, according to the report. When looking at all minimum-wage workers, including those who lost a job or left the labor force altogether, about 51 percent of them were earning higher than the minimum wage after a year on the job. Jonathan Meer, a co-author of the Texas A&M report and an economics professor there, told us workers who got a pay hike may have been at the same job or moved on to another employer. We should note that the minimum wage included people who live in states that defer to the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage as well as in states that set the minimum at a higher rate. There are 29 states that have a higher minimum wage than the federal rate, but Virginia is not one of them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Jeremy West, the other co-author of the Texas A&M report, updated the figures for us. He said 72 percent of all minimum wage workers got a raise between 2014 and 2015. But about one-fifth of them got raises only because the minimum wage had been increased in their states. That means 57.5 percent of minimum wage earners got a raise at the discretion of their employers or because they found higher-paying jobs between 2014 and 2015. A final note: Our colleagues at PunditFact back in 2014 examined a similar statement by Steve Forbes, the former GOP presidential candidate. Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, told them that people who keep their minimum-wage jobs for one year are proving they’re dedicated employees who can hold jobs and that might speak more to why they’re getting a raise than anything else. As for those minimum-wage workers who instead leave the labor force entirely, they might be choosing to do so because they figure they can do about as well without a paycheck, Sinclair told PunditFact. Our ruling The National Federation of Independent Business here in Virginia says on its website that "the vast majority of minimum wage workers get a raise within a year." The group finds support from an older report from 12 years ago that says two-thirds of workers who stayed on the job got a raise within a year. The most recent numbers show that 72 percent of minimum wage workers got a raise between 2014 and 2015. But one-fifth of them got the boost only because their state had raised its minimum wage - a step the NFIB opposes. That means 57.5 percent of the workers got a raise at the discretion of their employers or because they had found better-paying jobs. We rate the claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d50a0a2-974e-4229-bf51-191c8b60d9b2	None	National Federation of Independent Business-Virginia	None	None	None	2016-06-02T09:02:27	2016-05-17	['None']
pomt-05132	"Did you know Wisconsin's AFSCME union has lost 50%+ of its members since no longer requiring membership?"	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/22/steve-buckstein/has-wisconsin-afscme-really-lost-50-percent-its-me/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker survived a recall vote this month, prompting pundits to weigh in on what that means for public sector unions that had campaigned aggressively for his ouster. Remember, Walker is the Republican governor who pushed through a number of changes unfriendly to organized labor in the Badger State, including an end to automatic union dues deductions from public paychecks. Here in the Beaver State, Steve Buckstein of the Cascade Policy Institute, a think tank that promotes limited government, tweeted: "Did you know Wisconsin's AFSCME union has lost 50%+ of its members since no longer requiring membership?" The tweet links to a June 14 online post by Buckstein called "End Forced Unionism Now," where he quotes from an opinion column by syndicated writer Charles Krauthammer, also published in The Oregonian: "Without the thumb of the state tilting the scale by coerced collection, union membership became truly voluntary. Result? Newly freed members rushed for the exits. In less than one year, AFSCME, the second largest public-sector union in Wisconsin, has lost more than 50 percent of its membership." The question is a simple one: Did membership in Wisconsin’s American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees drop by 50 percent since dues became optional? Here’s a quick reminder of what happened in Wisconsin: In March 2011, Walker signed a bill that drastically changed bargaining rights for some but not all state, local and school employees. As pointed out by Krauthammer, dues are no longer taken out of paychecks automatically, curtailing the union’s money base. According to PolitiFact Wisconsin, the law "limits the ability of public unions to bargain collectively for anything except raises controlled for inflation. It ended bargaining over benefits, overtime and work conditions." Unions have to recertify every year with fresh votes. And he increased employee contributions for pensions and health care. We asked Buckstein for his sourcing; he said he relied on the Krauthammer column. Krauthammer cites no source for the information, but a quick check online shows a May 30 news article in the Wall Street Journal: "Wisconsin Unions See Ranks Drop Ahead of Recall Vote." The reporters write that membership in the state’s second-largest public-sector union "fell to 28,745 in February from 62,818 in March 2011, according to a person who has viewed AFSCME's figures." That is indeed more than half its membership. Another story in the Wall Street Journal a few days later puts the drop at 45 percent. The union disputed the figures then, and disputes them now to PolitiFact Oregon. However, Wisconsin State Employees Union, AFSCME Council 24, declined to give updated figures, saying that even people on the inside don’t have an accurate count. Certainly numbers are down, they say. (A spokesman for Walker said the state does not have figures.) But what the union really objects to is the underlying premise in the syndicated column, and by association, Buckstein’s post: That premise is that union membership numbers dropped dramatically because people were given a choice between joining a union or not joining a union. According to the original Wall Street Journal news article, some members didn’t re-up because of the financial pinch of health care and pension costs. Bargaining was so curtailed that another fact check by PolitiFact Wisconsin found four experts who agreed the law could mean the end of some public unions in Wisconsin. Buckstein acknowledges that numbers probably went down more in Wisconsin because of the changes as a whole. But he stands by the idea that more members may opt out when deductions become optional. Oregon is a great example, he says. A check with the Department of Administrative Services finds that 24 percent of the more than 24,000 people eligible to be represented by the state’s two biggest state government unions pay a share in lieu of member dues. In other words, they pay in, but are not members. The fair-share option may not be available to all employees, and depends on the terms of the bargaining contract. In either case, the money is deducted automatically from workers’ paychecks. People on various sides of the political spectrum have their own theories about why there was a decrease in Wisconsin: higher premiums, limited bargaining subjects, complicated recertification votes, optional dues, all or some, or none of the above. We can’t rule on reason. What we can rule on is that membership has gone down about 50 percent, according to news reports, since Walker implemented his changes. That decrease may or may not hold when numbers finally shake out. The tweet is accurate, but needs additional information. We rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-06822	The Northwest Corridor highway project in Cobb and Cherokee counties "is expected to create over 9,700 jobs statewide."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/10/georgia-department-transportation/gdot-road-construction-bring-9700-jobs/	There’s nothing like a rosy job creation estimate to light up the Truth-O-Meter. Agencies regularly talk up these figures to show projects with big price tags have major benefits. Readers regularly wonder whether they’re true. Recently, a reader asked us to look into this projection for the Northwest Corridor project, which will add and change lanes on I-75 and I-575 in Cobb and Cherokee counties: "The Northwest Corridor -- a $96 million project with a projected $1.5 billion in positive economic impact -- is expected to create over 9,700 jobs statewide and provide immense benefits to metro Atlanta, the state of Georgia, and the southeastern United States," a July 19 press release from the Georgia Department of Transportation read. GDOT issued the press release to trumpet that the state was invited to apply for a special U.S. Department of Transportation-sponsored loan that could lower the cost of the project. More than 9,700 jobs statewide? Is that true? A GDOT spokeswoman referred us to an April 2010 report issued by the Fiscal Research Center of Georgia State University’s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. According to estimates from a GDOT consultant, the state will spend $922 million statewide on the project. Construction will create more than 5,225 "person-years of full-time equivalent employment" across Georgia. What’s a "person-year of full-time equivalent employment," you ask? We interviewed John Matthews, who was a senior research associate with GSU when he served as the study’s lead author. He told us this measure is one we’ve encountered before -- "job years." "Job years" do not represent the number of people the project will employ. PolitiFact Georgia researched this measure on a story about the Atlanta streetcar project, which will build a line downtown. Economists use the "job years" measure to help them account for the employee churn that takes place during complex projects. Different phases require workers with different expertise. Early on, it might need concrete experts. Later, it will need ones that can install road signs or toll booths. Some jobs may last days. Others could last years. Some might require part-timers, while others need full-timers. The "full-time equivalent" measure counts a single position as a bundle of workers who, when you add up their hours, work what amounts to full-time. It could be a single person who works 40 hours a week or, say, four workers who put in 10 hours each. One "person-year of full-time equivalent employment," or one "job year," is one year’s worth of work by a full-time equivalent. We ruled the Atlanta streetcar jobs figures False. Although the construction figures were close to the mark, the claim that it will take an estimated 460 jobs to run the streetcar was inflated. In fact, it would take 23 positions to run the streetcar over 20 years. Their jobs figure was 20 times too high. Now, back to the Northwest Corridor. Construction takes place over four years, so a single job that lasts four years counts as four job years. This means that if all workers stay on for all four years, the actual number of people employed would be one quarter of GDOT’s 5,200 estimate. But if workers come and go as they do in a more typical construction project, the number could be higher. Let’s say it takes one worker nine months to finish the job of pouring concrete. He leaves, and another joins for three months to paint stripes on the road. Bundled together, these two workers equal a single job year. Now, GDOT says that the project was estimated to create some 9,700 jobs, not 5,200 jobs. The rest come from "indirect" and "induced" economic impacts. Indirect jobs are the result of spending on materials for the project, such as steel or rebar. Induced jobs are created when workers use their wages to buy a cheeseburger or a Lady Gaga album. Add these job years to the construction ones and you get about 9,700 -- the figure GDOT used. How do we rule? The typical person thinks of "jobs" as actual positions or hires, not job years, indirect jobs or induced jobs. So when GDOT announces that their project creates about 9,700 jobs, they’re giving voters an inflated sense of the actual projections. GDOT could have said the Northwest Corridor project is expected to create what amounts to 5,225 full-time jobs across Georgia over four years, plus an additional 4,480 with the increased spending the project creates. Or they could say construction is expected to created the equivalent of 1,190 full-time jobs in the first year, for a total of 5,225 over four years. None of these descriptions are as succinct as GDOT’s claim that that the Northwest Corridor highway project "is expected to create over 9,700 jobs statewide." But they do give a more complete sense of Georgia State’s actual projection. GDOT’s jobs figure is based on legitimate, commonly-used economic measures, but the agency presents the data in a misleading way. Their press release makes non-experts think thousands more people will find full-time construction work than actual estimates suggest. We therefore rule GDOT’s jobs claim False.

pomt-15287	"Obama’s Clean Power Plan ... eliminates coal-fired power plants."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/jul/24/robert-henneke/robert-henneke-says-obamas-clean-power-plan-elimin/	A federal plan to drive down carbon emissions wipes out coal-fired power plants, an Austin analyst wrote. In a June 2015 opinion column published in the Austin American-Statesman, Robert Henneke of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation took issue with the Clean Power Plan released in 2014 by President Barack Obama’s administration. Henneke, director of the foundation’s Center for the American Future, wrote: "Coal, the target of Obama’s Clean Power Plan, generates 34 percent of Texas’s electricity. The plan eliminates coal-fired power plants and requires Texas to assume reductions in excess of 27 other states combined." It doesn’t surprise us that the nation’s second-largest state would be saddled with more reductions than a slew of other states. For this fact check, we focused on whether the Obama plan eliminates coal-fired plants — a claim the Texas office of the Environmental Defense Fund brought to our attention, calling it inaccurate. To our inquiry, a foundation spokeswoman, Caroline Espinosa, conceded by email that under the Environmental Protection Agency plan, all "coal-fired plants are not eliminated, though," she said, "a great number of them will be: enough to cause grievous harm to the Texas economy and Texas families." Let’s summarize the plan, which is to be finalized this year, then explore its impact on coal-fired electricity plants. Clean Power Plan The Clean Power Plan is premised on the states by 2030 collectively driving down carbon emissions from power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels — in part, the agency has said, through regional "cap and trade" networks, investments in renewable energy and smart grid technology — plus phase-outs of many existing coal-fueled plants. "Power plants," the EPA says in a fact sheet last updated in June 2015, "are the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, making up roughly one-third of all domestic greenhouse gas emissions." A 2014 fact check But PolitiFact concluded previously that the plan doesn’t outlaw coal as fuel or require coal-fired plants to close. In August 2014, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., rated False a claim by U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., that the administration plan meant coal would not be permitted as an electricity fuel, even in limited amounts. In 2014, Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, said: "In no way does this program say coal can’t live. What it is is a death blow for outdated, old, vintage coal plants, unless they pay for" technology upgrades. Amy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis, said at the time that states would influence the process as each one creates its blueprint for decreasing emissions. "It may be in some places there is nothing you can do other than stop using coal, but there's nothing in the rules that says there can’t be coal," Jaffe said. EPA: Plan doesn't mandate retirement of coal-fired plants To our inquiry, a Washington-based EPA spokeswoman, Enesta Jones, said by email "EPA’s proposal provides each state with enormous flexibility to design plans that meet their individual and unique needs, and does not mandate the retirement of any coal plants." Nationally, though, coal is expected to recede as a fuel. The EPA’s initial estimates assumed 30 percent of the country’s energy would come from coal in 2030, down from 39 percent in 2013. According to the agency, the plan gives each state a different threshold for reducing carbon emissions it must reach based on feasibility, cost and current pollution levels, among factors. And, the agency says, it’s up to each state to decide how to comply. Federal rules against mercury emissions, which experts have described as more stringent than the pending power plan, also could factor into coal fading. Foundation cites national and Texas studies Espinosa, elaborating on Henneke’s claim, told us there are reasons to expect Texas plants to close due to the plan. By email, she pointed out a May 2015 analysis of the plan undertaken by the U.S. Energy Information Administration at the request of U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Nationally under the plan, the report says, projected coal plant "retirements," meaning closings, would total 90 gigawatts in power generation, most of that occurring by 2020. That prediction compares with an expected retirement of 40 gigawatts in coal-fueled power if the plan doesn’t take effect, the report says. New plants, the report says,would largely be fueled by natural gas and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Texas stands to see coal-fired generation decline by 100 billion kilowatthours by 2025 — alongside spurts in natural gas and renewable energy — with a slight coal rebound occurring by 2040, the report says. In the illustration below, the "Base Policy" case refers to EIA’s modeling of the Clean Power Plan and the "AEO2015 Reference Case" reflects its projections of energy supply, demand and prices based on federal, state and local laws in place as of October 2014 — in other words, without the EPA plan in effect: Espinosa, in her email, said the "remarkable extent of de facto coal-fire plant elimination in Texas" is backed up by the the Balanced Energy for Texas Coalition--which represents consumers and coal producers, transporters and industrial users, spokesman Russ Keene told us. By email, Keene said the EPA’s own Integrated Planning Model indicates 24 of the 41-coal fired power plants in Texas would close from 2020 to 2025 under the administration plan even though none are currently scheduled to retire for other reasons. The EPA in 2013 described the planning model as a "multi-regional, dynamic, deterministic linear programming model of the U.S. electric power sector. It provides forecasts of least cost capacity expansion, electricity dispatch, and emission control strategies while meeting energy demand and environmental, transmission, dispatch, and reliability constraints. IPM can be used to evaluate the cost and emissions impacts of proposed policies to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), mercury (Hg), and" hydrochloric acid "from the electric power sector." Espinosa forwarded an email from Austin attorney Michael J. Nasi, who represents the coalition, stating the calculations behind the projection were rooted in EPA data. Separately, Terry Hadley, spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, pointed out an August 2014 filing with the commission from Nasi on behalf of the Partnership for a Better Energy Future, which the filing describes as drawing together more than 150 trade groups including the American Petroleum Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Texas Association of Business and the American Farm Bureau Federation. The filing says EPA’s assumptions about plants switching from coal to natural gas to reduce carbon emissions indicate Texas would experience a decrease of 72 million megawatt hours from coal-fired plants, most of that by 2020. Other analyses We asked others including the EPA to assess the plan’s effect on coal-fired plants. By phone and email, Ilan Levin, an Austin-based lawyer for the Environmental Integrity Project, which focuses on strict enforcement of anti-pollution laws, questioned the coalition’s conclusion that the plan would result in 24 Texas coal-fired plants shutting down. While the EPA predicts a drop in coal-fired electricity by 2030, he said, and an EPA scenario involves Texas fulfilling its CO2-reduction goals by moving from coal to natural gas power generation and improved efficiency, Levin said, the federal plan "simply sets goals and leaves it to the states on how to get there. It's premature to say the CPP eliminates coal plants," he said. That said, Levin added, there "are certainly very realistic scenarios with retirements of many Texas coal plants in the next 15 years or so. But these are driven mainly by economics. Regulatory drivers, specifically EPA rules that will involve more costs to power plants, include a long list of anti- smog and mercury rules and clean water and waste rules that have been in development for years if not decades. So, CPP is an important rule," he said, "but it has not yet been implemented by the states, so all the details in terms of how it will get implemented have yet to be written." By phone, Adele Morris, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution, said coal has been supplanted by other fuel sources already for a variety of reasons, some of them regulatory, others having to do with natural gas being cheaper and new plants being cheaper to build than it costs to fix up old ones. Jones, the EPA spokeswoman, called the coalition’s calculation a "reasonable interpretation of the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) data for the proposed Clean Power Plan. Our own review was slightly different, showing 23 additional retirements in 2025," she said. "Actual compliance may differ from the illustrative approaches that EPA lays out," she said, again noting each state is to determine how to meet its carbon reduction goals. In Texas, Robbie Searcy, a staff spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the flow of electricity to most Texans, responded to our inquiry by pointing us to a November 2014 report in which ERCOT estimated the proposed CO2 emission limits would result in the retirement of 3,300 to 8,700 megawatts of coal generation capacity in Texas. Yet Searcy also emailed us an agency summary of a December 2014 ERCOT report indicating multiple federal pollution regulations might explain plant closings. The summary said: "Coal-fired power plants are the most affected by environmental regulations, which include the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, the Regional Haze program, the 316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structures Rule, the Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines Rule, the Coal Combustion Residuals Disposal Rule, and the proposed Clean Power Plan released earlier this year. "ERCOT assessed the impacts of these regulations through a generator survey and a modeling analysis. Results indicate that the Regional Haze Program and Clean Power Plan, in combination with other regulations, could result in the retirement of up to 8,700 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation resources in the ERCOT region. That is about half the coal-fired capacity and more than 13 percent of the overall thermal generation resources, by MW, that serve ERCOT today." By telephone, John Hall of the Environmental Defense Fund, Texas, said he read the December 2014 ERCOT report to mean the Clean Power Plan could by itself account for 200 megawatt hours in additional coal-fueled power plant reductions in Texas--which he said amounts to one third to one half of a plant. We asked ERCOT if it expects coal-fired plant closings due to many federal pollution regulations, with the pending power plan perhaps playing a minimal role? By email, Searcy said: "Yes, ERCOT anticipates that some coal-fired plants will retire as a result of changes to environmental regulations. It is too early to tell what… role (minimal or otherwise) CPP specifically will play." Our ruling Henneke said "Obama’s Clean Power Plan ... eliminates coal-fired power plants." That’s off the mark in that the plan, yet to be finalized, doesn’t wipe out any coal-fired plants. It looks to us like decisions to close plants (or individual units) will depend on how Texas decides to address its assigned carbon-reduction goals. Meantime, pollution limits already in place might hasten shutdowns--with or without the Clean Power Plan taking effect. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-02356	"Florida ranks first in the nation for access to free prekindergarten."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/mar/20/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-floridas-vpk-no-1-country-access/	In a photo any candidate for re-election would crave, Gov. Rick Scott is seated alongside a couple of cute pre-kindergarten kids at a science museum as a girl chews on her fingers and a boy reaches in a container for a crayon. Scott was at the the Science and Discovery Center of Northwest Florida in Panama City on March 12, 2014, to tout funding for the state’s voluntary pre-kindergarten program, known as VPK. A few days later, he boasted about VPK in a tweet: "Florida ranks first in the nation for access to free prekindergarten. We need to keep it that way." Scott, a Republican, is expected to face former Gov. Charlie Crist, now a Democrat, in November. Education has become a hot topic in the race and PolitiFact Florida has previously fact-checked claims about K-12 and higher education. Here we decided to explore Scott’s claim about the state’s ranking on access to VPK. Report comparing states on preschool Florida’s VPK program launched in 2005 as a result of voters approving an amendment to provide free access to all of the state’s 4-year-olds to prepare them for kindergarten. Students learn how to identify shapes and colors, write their own name, recognize letters and recognize patterns, among other skills. The program is offered at public schools and private day care centers. Children can enroll in a school-year program that totals 540 hours. That typically translates to three hours a day during the school year -- though many parents pay for additional "wrap-around" hours. Parents can also elect a summer program of 300 hours instead of the school year. The National Institute for Early Education Research, a unit of the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers, publishes an annual State Preschool Yearbook that has tracked the funding, access, and policies of state-funded pre-school programs since the 2001-02 school year. We looked at the rankings for Florida, which was compared against programs in 40 states during the 2011-12 school year. (The next report is expected in April.) The report ranked the states on the following criteria: Access. Florida ranked No. 1 for serving 4-year-olds with 79 percent of the eligible population served in 2012. Participation has grown rapidly from about 100,000 students in 2005 to 175,000 in 2011-12. The program remains optional, so it may not continue to grow much higher in terms of the percentage served. State spending. Florida ranked No. 35 for state spending. The amount of state funding per student dropped from $2,755 in 2008 to $2,281 in 2012, according to the report. The state’s Office of Early Learning had a slightly different figure because it provides a per-pupil amount for the school year and a lower one for the summer. In 2010-11 -- the budget set before Scott was elected -- the per-pupil school year amount was $2,562. Then under Scott it dropped to $2,383 where it has stayed for three years. Scott has proposed a $100 increase. Quality benchmarks. Florida meets only three of the 10 benchmarks -- those related to early learning standards, class size and site monitoring. It did not meet benchmarks that related to teacher degrees, specialized training and other areas. Florida and Ohio both met three benchmarks. Only one state met fewer (Texas with two). Experts weigh in on Florida’s VPK program So what’s the big picture about Florida’s VPK program? Does it make sense for Scott to boast about access when the state lags behind in per-pupil spending and quality benchmarks? Many states face the tradeoff between broad access and commitment to quality, said Daphna Bassok, an expert in early childhood education and assistant professor at the University of Virginia. "Overall, Florida’s program is characterized by very high access but relatively low quality, as far as quality standards, length of school day, dollars per child," and other issues, she told PolitiFact Florida. Another expert said that the benchmarks set by the National Institute for Early Education Research, or NIEER, are subjective measures of quality. Grover (Russ) Whitehurst, a former U.S. Education Department official under President George W. Bush and a fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted that one benchmark requires programs to provide one meal a day. But that doesn’t make sense for a program such as Florida’s that offers three hours a day. "Access and state spending are based on hard data, whereas the NIEER benchmarks are nothing more than the opinion of NIEER, an advocacy organization," Whitehurst told PolitiFact Florida. "I place little stock in the NIEER benchmarks." Scott’s spokeswoman referred us to the state’s Office of Early Learning for a response. "When it comes to the benchmarks that NIEER uses to rank states for quality and spending, we believe that the most important benchmark is not included," spokeswoman Cynthia Sucher told PolitiFact Florida. "How well does VPK prepare Florida 4-year-olds for kindergarten?" Assessments done by public school districts once students enter kindergarten show that almost 82 percent of children who completed a VPK program were ready for kindergarten, compared to about 53 percent of those who did not participate in VPK in 2013. That was the fifth consecutive year of an increase in the preparedness rate for those that completed VPK. But that data isn’t compelling, some say, because there are likely differences in the backgrounds and abilities between the two groups. Non-attendees may be poorer or have parents who don’t speak English, Whitehurst said. That makes it difficult to draw conclusions that it's the program that's causing better outcomes. "The present evidence that Florida's VPK is having a positive impact on school readiness and later academic achievement is weak to nonexistent," he said. "This doesn't mean it isn't having a positive impact. Rather, it means that the impact is presently unknown." Our ruling Scott said, "Florida ranks first in the nation for access to free prekindergarten." A national education group ranked Florida No. 1 in access for 4-year-olds during the 2011-12 school year, the most recent year available. However, the same report ranked Florida 35th in state spending per pupil. The report also concluded that the state only met three of 10 benchmarks, though it’s possible for education experts to quibble about the value of those benchmarks. Scott was careful with his wording because he only mentioned "access," but the rest of the report’s findings may provide a different picture of Florida’s VPK program. His statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-03-20T15:55:50	2014-03-16	['None']
pomt-07978	"We had a debate on whether ‘ObamaCare’ was the way to go to fix up health care and the American voters said no -- emphatically."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/20/jim-sensenbrenner/rep-jim-sensenbrenner-says-americans-have-emphatic/	As Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives planned their January 2011 vote to repeal the health care reform bill, members turned to the results of the November election for support. In Washington, Republicans swept to power in the House and narrowed Democratic majorities in the Senate. In Wisconsin, the GOP won a U.S. Senate seat, the governor’s office and both chambers of the Legislature. Repealing health reform -- "ObamaCare," as they label it -- was a part of Republican campaigns at all levels. In the run-up to the House repeal vote, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, appeared Jan. 16, 2010 at a town hall meeting. In comments to reporters, including WTMJ-AM (620), he discussed the rationale for pursuing repeal of the law. (On Jan. 19, the Republican-led House voted 245-189 largely along party lines to repeal the health care reform bill, but the effort is likely to die in the Senate.) "The House of Representatives -- and this representative -- has listened to the American people," Sensenbrenner said. "We had a debate on whether ‘ObamaCare' was the way to go to fix up health care and the American voters said no -- emphatically." Of course, public opinion can be a moving target. And election mandates can grow over time, especially in the eyes of the winners. So we decided to take a look at Sensenbrenner’s statement, including at what current polls are showing. Asked for support for Sensenbrenner’s position, aides noted he held 101 town hall meetings in his district last year. "At these meetings, the overwhelming majority of attendees (public from the 5th District) were opposed to the healthcare bill and/or supported the law’s repeal," said communications director Wendy Riemann. She added that 70 percent to 75 percent of those who called or wrote Sensenbrenner’s office since last February "have been opposed to the law and would like to see it repealed." Sensenbrenner’s staff also pointed to a Jan. 17, 2011 Rasmussen Reports poll, the day after he spoke. That poll said 55 percent of likely voters favor repeal of the health care law, while 40 percent oppose repeal. Here’s the question Rasmussen asked: "A proposal has been made to repeal the health care bill and stop it from going into effect. Do you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose or strongly oppose a proposal to repeal the health care bill?" On the face of it, 55 percent does not seem "emphatic." Indeed, according to the firm, the percentage strongly favoring repeal has fallen. The firm’s summary said: "Just 40 percent strongly favor repeal, matching the lowest level found since the health care bill became law. Thirty percent strongly oppose repeal." We found some other fresh polls, which provide a murkier picture than the one painted by Sensenbrenner. The Associated Press conducted its own poll and reported Jan. 17 that "strong opposition to the law stands at 30 percent." The figure was close to the lowest level found in AP surveys dating back to September 2009. "The nation is divided over the law, but the strength and intensity of the opposition appear diminished," the AP reported. "The poll finds that 40 percent of those surveyed said they support the law, while 41 percent oppose it. Just after the November congressional elections, opposition stood at 47 percent and support was 38 percent." The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4.2 percentage points. As for repeal, only about one in four said they want to do away with the law completely. Meanwhile, the Kaiser Family Foundation conducts a health tracking poll and in January 2011 issued an update about public opinion about reform. "The last Kaiser Health Tracking Poll of the year found that 42 percent of Americans held a favorable view of health reform, 41 percent an unfavorable view and 18 percent offered no opinion. This pattern has been roughly stable over the eight months since passage, suggesting that neither side has been able to make a definitive case for or against the bill." Kaiser’s report added that 26 percent of those surveyed want to repeal the law in its entirety; 25 percent want to repeal parts of the law and keep other parts; one in five want to leave the law as it is; and one in five want to expand the law. Finally, a Jan. 7, 2011 Gallup poll concluded that Americans "do not strongly endorse" House Republicans’ efforts to repeal the bill. Gallup found that 46 percent of Americans want their representative in Congress to vote to repeal the health care law, 40 percent want their representative to vote to let the law stand, and 14 percent have no opinion. That’s the view today. What about at the time of the election? PolitiFact Wisconsin addressed this topic last fall, during the race for U. S. Senate. We looked into a television ad by Ron Johnson that claimed, "A majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care" and rated the claim False. In that case, the polling was more mixed than Johnson presented and, in some cases, respondents opposed the law not because it went too far, but because it did not go far enough. Where does all of this leave us today? Sensenbrenner said American voters had "emphatically" rejected the federal health reform changes. District residents may have felt that way, though calls to a congressman’s office are hardly scientific -- and Sensenbrenner’s statement cited national opinion on the issue. Also, numerous polls after the November election indicated that voters had one issue foremost in their mind: the economy. Of four fresh looks at how Americans feel about repealing health care reform, his staff chose one -- Rasmussen’s poll of likely voters -- that supported his position. But that sentiment is not shared by the public at large, according to multiple other polls. And in the Rasmussen poll, the percentage strongly supporting repeal has fallen. We rate Sensenbrenner’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08373	Says Tom Perriello voted "to give tax breaks to foreign companies creating jobs in China."	false	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/25/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-tom-perriello-voted-give-tax-brea/	State Sen. Robert Hurt says folks in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District do things "differently" than politicians in Washington. But Hurt is following the same playbook as other Republican candidates by attacking his Democratic opponent’s support of the stimulus by raising the specter of Communist China -- complete with a red Chinese flag on a make-believe TV set. "Differently" is a Hurt political ad that plays the China card against U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello, a Democrat from Charlottesville, for his vote in favor of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, better known as the stimulus package signed by President Obama in February 2009. The ad defends Hurt against accusations by Perriello that he wants to ship jobs overseas. "That’s just false," the announcer states. "But Perriello did vote to give tax breaks to foreign companies creating jobs in China." The ad says the accusation is based on a story published Sept. 9 in the Washington Times that says "as much as 80 percent of some green programs, including $2.3 billion of manufacturing tax credits, went to foreign firms that employed workers primarily in countries including China, South Korea and Spain, rather than in the United States." It’s an assertion that originates from a series of stories by the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University in Washington. The workshop report, "Blown Away," documents how foreign-based companies are using stimulus grants to develop wind farms in the United States. The workshop’s initial estimate in October 2009, was that foreign companies collected 80 percent of $1 billion in grants. An update in February pegged the estimate at 79 percent of $2.1 billion in grants. But those are allforeign companies, not just those from China. The Chinese connection comes from a $1.5 billion wind farm proposed last year in Texas by a consortium of American and Chinese companies that planned to buy turbines manufactured in China for the wind farm. Subsequently, the consortium partners have proposed to build a factory in Nevada to produce the turbines and most of their components. Here’s the problem for Hurt and other politicians relying on the Washington Times story: the $2.3 billion in manufacturing credits come from a part of the stimulus act that explicitly links the credits to creation of manufacturing jobs in green industries in the United States, according to the workshop report. By contrast, the workshop investigation focused on a provision that allowed payments in lieu of tax credits for development of alternative energy sources, including wind farms, without requiring the projects to produce manufacturing jobs in the United States. "They’re sort of freely mixing the two programs," Russ Choma, the journalist who produced the workshop report, told PolitiFact. So while the Times story may be correct in asserting that investments in alternative energy technologies haven’t created as many U.S. jobs as some supporters wanted, the story does not provide sufficient evidence to back up Hurt’s claim. Yet in campaign ads in many states, Republicans have portrayed a vote for the stimulus to be a vote to send jobs to China, glossing over the details of the actual program. They have exaggerated the total money that’s gone to this particular program and ignored the small portion that actually ended up in China. The same day Hurt’s ad first aired, Choma published an update on the workshop Web site that referred to a similar dustup in a West Virginia congressional race. In it, Choma said the IRW hadn’t found any examples of wind turbines built entirely in China. Choma cited the conclusion of a PolitiFact National analysis in February that debunked a similar assertion by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Subsequently, PolitiFact reports in Georgia and Wisconsin found little or no truth in similar accusations by Republican congressional candidates. He also revised his estimates that had originally said 80 percent of the money went to foreign companies. The revised estimate said 54 percent of a total of $4.4 billion in grants for wind farms had gone to foreign-owned companies, and that 65 percent of the turbines installed on those farms were constructed by foreign manufacturers instead of the original estimate of 79 percent. It is true that many companies taking advantage of the grants for alternative energy sources are based outside of the U.S., but most of them are in Europe and none was owned by a Chinese company. The American Wind Energy Association, representing the developers involved, said only three of the 33,000 wind turbines operating in the U.S. today were made in China and those included parts made in Minnesota and North Dakota. The association claims the tax credit provision in the stimulus act "saved" 40,000 jobs in the American wind industry by stimulating demand. It does not have an estimate of the jobs that would be created by the manufacturing tax credit cited by the Washington Times. Choma, the author whose article sparked the allegation, remains perplexed by the avalanche of ads that have relied on his work. "I don’t see how you can attach China to the manufacturing tax credit," Choma told us. We don’t see the connection either, so we find Hurt’s claim to be False.

pomt-14381	"Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student."	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/mar/17/hillary-clinton/clinton-ad-claims-arizona-lags-k-12-education/	With Arizona’s Presidential Preference Election set for Tuesday, presidential candidates -- and their accompanying advertisements -- have picked up steam. Hillary Clinton’s campaign aired a 30-second spot on Arizona airwaves on March 16 specific to K-12 education. "Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student," the ad states. "Hillary knows our kids deserve better, education means a good job, a decent living." The ad proposes preschool for every student as well as college without "crushing debt." The ad cites a January 2016 Education Week ranking for the 45th in the nation claim. Education Week uses several measures, including finance, achievement and chance for success. Arizona Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said the numbers were accurate based on the sources cited. For the dead last in funding per student part of the claim, the ad cites the Arizona School Boards Association, a statewide nonprofit. Clinton campaign spokesman Tim Hogan noted that both claims were from the Education Week report. Education Week uses data from several federal agencies, including the U.S. Education Department, U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Commerce Department. According to the data, Arizona spends $7,733 per student, almost 35 percent less than the national average of $11,841 per student. The numbers are adjusted for regional cost differences. In fiscal year 2013, Arizona ranked 49th, out of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, in per student spending, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. "That’s the sad reality, the lack of investment in human capital," said Arizona School Boards Association Executive Director Timothy Ogle. However, Arizona isn’t dead last in per-student spending -- Utah is. According to Education Week’s regionally adjusted numbers, Utah ranks 51st, spending $7,084 per student. The data includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C. However, the actual text of the advertisement does mention that Arizona is 50th in per student funding though, which is correct. They’re just not dead last. Our ruling Clinton’s campaign said, "Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student." Education Week data vets the first claim, but the advertisement is off by one in its claim that the Grand Canyon State is dead last. Utah is. Both states still spend thousands of dollars less than the national average in funding per student. We rate the ad as Mostly True.

pomt-08149	Measures taken by my administration "have saved taxpayers $1 billion."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/05/donald-carcieri/carcieri-says-his-administration-saved-rhode-islan/	Forget the $64,000 question. That's chump change these days. With Governor Carcieri about to leave office, the question is: Did his administration save Rhode Island taxpayers $1 billion during his eight years in office? Carcieri made that claim in a commentary piece published in The Providence Journal on Nov. 8. "Today state government is leaner, more frugal and more accountable to the taxpayers than it was eight years ago," he wrote. "We have enacted separation of powers; cleaned up Resource Recovery and Beacon Mutual; reduced the number of state employees by over 2,000; implemented state employee pension and health-insurance reforms; rooted out government waste, and instituted scores of efficiencies over the years. Combined, these measures have saved taxpayers nearly $1 billion." That's a lot of money, especially in a state facing huge budget deficits. We wondered where those saving came from, so we asked the Carcieri administration for the details to back up that $1 billion claim. After a week and a half, administration officials provided a spreadsheet that shows savings in 16 categories totaling $1,067,484,418.97. We examined them all. But let's talk about the four big-ticket items that, together, account for $803.5 million of the savings. "Staff Reduction" The administration says it saved a total of $191.6 million by cutting the number of full-time-equivalent state employees from 15,312 to 13,050 -- a reduction of 2,262 jobs -- which matches Carcieri's claim that he reduced the number of state employees by "over 2,000." The administration uses numbers from the start of the 2003 fiscal year -- six months before Carcieri took office. If you start counting when Carcieri became governor, the job cuts total 2,033, House fiscal records show. But that's still "over 2,000." The administration excluded research positions at state colleges sponsored by third parties. But House fiscal officials, who have a big role in writing the budget, think it's best to include those positions, House spokesman Larry Berman said. If you do, the Carcieri administration has cut 1,761 jobs, he said. We then questioned whether the administration had replaced state employees with contract workers. Berman said it's tough to tell, but the Assembly has established greater scrutiny and controls over use of contractors in lieu of state employees. Rosemary Booth Gallogly, Carcieri's director of administration, said the state had 873 contract employees before Carcieri took office and now it has no more than 646. To calculate the $191.6 million in staff-reduction savings, the administration multiplied the number of full-time equivalents cut each year by that year's average cost of state employee wages and benefits. (The wage-and-benefits average rose from $68,315 in fiscal year 2003 to $95,197 in fiscal year 2010.) "Pension Reform" On the administration's original spreadsheet, the single largest category of savings was "Pension Reform," totaling $398.8 million. Administration documents show the pension savings came in three waves, beginning in fiscal year 2006 when changes in retirement age, benefits and cost-of-living adjustments saved $44 million a year. A second wave began in 2009 when changes in retirement eligibility, benefits and final average compensation resulted in savings of $59.4 million, on top of the annual $44 million amount. And a third wave began in 2010 when cost-of-living adjustments were limited to the first $35,000 of annual pension, saving an additional $16 million. Those cumulative savings are expected to continue, but the spreadsheet does not reflect pension savings for future years. Retiree Health-Care By contrast, the spreadsheet shows both past and future savings in retiree health-care costs as a lump sum of $111.3 million. Booth Gallogly explained those savings result from 2008 changes in eligibility and the requirement that those receiving retiree health care pay 20 percent of the cost. Those changes prompted many state employees to retire before the new rules took effect, she said. The state has already saved some of that money. For example, she said $10.6 million was saved in fiscal year 2009, but other parts of those savings will be realized over the next 30 years. So why count the pension reform savings year by year while counting the retiree health-care savings all at once? Booth Gallogly said full documentation for the year-to-year retiree health-care savings were not readily available. But, she said, "Actions you take now to reduce the unfunded liability should be counted in the year you take them. It's still good savings." "We drink from wells we did not dig," Booth Gallogly said, using a saying that stems from the Book of Deuteronomy. "Many of the things being done will have a very significant impact over time, as long as they don't get reversed." Russell Dannecker, a former state Senate fiscal adviser who is now the fiscal policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Poverty Institute, said the state will eventually save $111.3 million, but it hasn't saved that total amount yet. John Simmons, executive director of the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (and a member of Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee's transition team), said the Carcieri administration and the General Assembly deserve credit for both the $111.3 million in retiree health-care savings and whatever the full impact of the pension reform will be over time because those are "structural changes" that will lower the amount of money the state must spend in those areas. While some of those savings won't be realized for say 20 years, "it's savings nonetheless," he said. And if you add all that up, it would exceed the $1 billion amount cited by the governor, he said. "Co-share savings" The last big category is savings on health insurance premiums for state employees. Booth Gallogly said state employees used to pay nothing toward their health insurance but now they pay up to 25 percent, for a total savings of $101.8 million. The changes started in 2005 with nonunion employees; union employees were added in later years. Other categories Those four categories account for about 75 percent of the $1 billion in savings cited by Carcieri, but it's also worth looking at a couple of smaller categories. For example, the spreadsheet lists $15.5 million in savings from moving state offices out of leased space and into state-owned properties, such as the move of the Division of Motor Vehicles from the Apex building in Pawtucket to state-owned property in Cranston. Dannecker said such moves undoubtedly save the state rent money. But the state can also incur considerable costs from renovating and operating state-owned properties, he said. The renovations to the Forand Building, which now houses the DMV, came to $17.9 million. The final category of savings was $37.1 million in "Department of Corrections Cost Avoidance." Corrections Director A.T. Wall explained that state prisons were becoming overcrowded, threatening to exceed agreed-up limits resulting a from federal court action, so officials considered spending $31.7 million to build new housing units at the John J. Moran Medium-Security Facility. But the state avoided that cost by enacting legislation in 2008 that allowed inmates serving shorter sentences to shave time off their sentences through good behavior and participating in rehabilitation programs, he said. Dannecker said it's good the state avoided the cost of a new prison construction. But, he asked, "Is cost avoidance a savings to the taxpayer? Isn't that really just good government? It certainly did not reduce the taxpayers' burden from what it was. When I think of savings to the taxpayer, I think we were paying this amount and now we are paying less. That's how I classify savings." He offered the example of a broken refrigerator: You could pay $200 to fix it or spend $2,000 for a new one, but if you choose the less expensive option, it's a good choice but it doesn't mean you have $1,800 more in your checking account. Simmons maintained that avoiding the cost of new prison construction does represent valid savings. Berman said, "It's important to note that the governor did not find these savings alone. Almost all of them were included in the budgets that the General Assembly enacted." Carcieri spokeswoman Amy Kempe agreed that, "without the cooperation of the General Assembly, significant amounts of that savings would not have been achieved." But she said the governor can set the agenda by making proposals, and he proposed going even further in areas such as pension reform. Bottom line In the end, Carcieri's statement that "these measures saved taxpayers nearly $1 billion" requires further analysis and explanation. It's clear, for example, that many millions of dollars in savings are expected in future years but haven't been realized yet; that some savings come with offsetting costs; and that even the best budget experts disagree about issues such as whether "cost avoidance" is the same as take-it-to-the-bank, cut-my-budget savings. Also, it appears Carcieri tossed out the $1 billion figure before completing a full, accurate analysis of those savings. It's also worth nothing that the total state budget grew from $5.77 billion in fiscal year 2004 to $7.86 billion in the current year. But that includes federal funding, a major portion of the budget. The state share of spending grew from $2.72 billion to $2.94 billion in that period, about 8 percent. Booth Gallogly said state spending would have gone up more had the cuts not been made. "We would have had to either increase taxes or other revenues or reduce expenditures in areas that might have been Draconian," she said. But there's no doubt that the Carcieri administration, mostly in concert with the General Assembly, helped save taxpayers a lot of money over the past eight years. If you take the most liberal interpretation claimed by the governor -- factoring in both past and future pension-reform and retiree health-care savings -- the final figure could be substantially more than $1 billion. If you take the most conservative estimate -- only counting pension-reform and retiree health-care savings to date and excluding "cost avoidance" -- the final figure, by our calculation, would total in the neighborhood of $930 million. We take the moderate approach, rating Carcieri's claim "Mostly True."	None	Donald Carcieri	None	None	None	2010-12-05T00:00:01	2010-11-08	['None']
pomt-09938	Says Vice President Joe Biden "admits that the American people are being scammed" with the economic stimulus package.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/08/john-boehner/boehner-claims-biden-said-stimulus-scamming-americ/	The White House has been trumpeting the success of its economic stimulus package. President Barack Obama claimed that in its first 100 days, the plan "saved or created" 150,000 jobs (which we rated Barely True ). On June 8, 2009, Obama promised that number would quadruple by the fall. Republicans are skeptical, however, saying the package hasn't delivered as many jobs as Obama claims. In response to Obama's latest promise, House Republican Minority Leader John Boehner offered this sharp criticism, calling the stimulus a "bloated government spending scheme" that hasn't helped the economy: "Democrats said [the stimulus] would immediately create jobs, yet nearly four months later unemployment has continued to climb and none of their rosy predictions have come true," he said in a statement. "Our plan to let the American people keep more of what they earn would have created twice the jobs at half the cost of the Democrats’ bloated government spending scheme. But instead of shifting course, Democrats are doubling down on their plan to spend taxpayer dollars as fast as possible, even as their own vice president admits that the American people are being scammed." We wondered if Boehner was right that Vice President Joe Biden had been so blunt in describing the legislative centerpiece of the Obama-Biden administration. Biden held a roundtable with business leaders on June 2 and discussed the stimulus plan and the administration's efforts to spend the money quickly but still avoid waste and fraud. An Associated Press account of that meeting said, "With so much money at stake, Biden said some waste was inevitable and that a team of federal auditors had already uncovered problematic projects. 'People are being scammed already,' Biden said, promising to expose abuses whenever they were detected." Biden was referring to the fact that some people have been lured by con artists who promise big stimulus bucks in return for personal information or a fee. Take Kristann Hartley, an Ohio woman featured in a National Public Radio report from March 9, 2009. Hartley applied for a stimulus grant to weatherize her home only to find out that the Web site offering the money was a scam. But Boehner's statement suggests Biden had a whole other meaning when he talked about 'people being scammed.' In reading the full text of Boehner's statement it's clear that Boehner was suggesting the stimulus spending plan itself is a mistake and that White House claims of positive economic effects are misleading. Using Biden's "scammed" remark in that context makes it sound like Biden was saying the same thing, acknowledging that the White House "scamming" the public by pretending the stimulus spending has been working. That's not what Biden meant at all. In fact, news coverage indicates the scammers Biden was talking about are garden-variety con artists merely using the stimulus as a cover, and that the programs they seek to exploit are just a minuscule portion of the $787 billion package. The Obama administration has emphasized many other anecdotes and news stories that show the stimulus working the way it is supposed to in helping local government avoid layoffs and helping states balance their budgets. Boehner may be technically correct that Biden mentioned people being scammed in the roundtable meeting. But Boehner incorrectly suggests the vice president called the stimulus a scam and he fails to note that Biden promised "to expose abuses whenever they were detected," as the AP reported. We find Boehner's claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08782	Property taxes "are now 18% higher than when (Mark Sharpe) first took office."	false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/20/josh-burgin/josh-burgin/	First, incumbent Mark Sharpe sent out a mailer saying he cut property taxes by 17 percent, making the case that his fiscal conservatism is a top reason he should be returned to the Hillsborough County Commission in these trying times. Oh, no he didn’t, challenger Josh Burgin shot back in a flier of his own. It was the first of at least four mail pieces that carried the teaser: "Voter Fraud Alert." Property taxes are actually "18 percent higher than when (Sharpe) first took office," said Burgin, who is seeking to unseat Sharpe in the at-large District 7 Republican primary. Awesome, we thought. Two politicians vying for the same seat making wildly opposing claims. This is why PolitiFact Florida exists! We looked at Sharpe first, and ruled that his claim was Barely True. Now we turn to Burgin’s claim, first calling him to ask him how he derived his figures. He sent us the numbers he used – the overall property tax revenue figures for each of the years Sharpe has been in office since 2004. We confirmed the numbers were accurate using Hillsborough County budget documents. In 2004, Hillsborough County collected $553.4 million in property taxes. This year, the number is projected to be $659.8 million. That’s actually a 19.2 percent increase. So Burgin was being cautious, gentle even, right? There’s just one significant problem with his calculation. And there’s another big asterisk. The county prepares its budget books and calculates its revenues and expenditures by fiscal year. And the fiscal year doesn’t mirror the calendar year. Fiscal year 2004 covers the period from Oct. 1, 2003 to Sept. 30, 2004. Sharpe first took office in November 2004. To calculate changes in tax revenue or tax rates involving Sharpe, the proper base year would be fiscal year 2005. It was not until September 2005 that Sharpe cast his first budgetary votes, setting property tax rates for fiscal year 2006. This is indeed significant because, while this may be hard to remember with property values now plummeting, home and business values were soaring during Sharpe’s first years in office. From fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005, property tax revenues jumped from $553.4 million to $610.8 million. With fiscal year 2005 as the base year, that means overall county property tax revenue has increased by nearly 8 percent during Sharpe’s tenure. Burgin claimed a tax increase of well more than double that – a gross exaggeration. That one year could make such a difference is a reflection of how overheated the real estate market was in the middle part of the decade. We can illustrate the phenomenon in reverse now, with property values plummeting. Sharpe has voted on next year’s tentative budget. If the tax rate approved so far holds, county budget officials project another nearly $74 million drop in property tax revenue. By that time, tax receipts will have fallen 4 percent below what they were when Sharpe took office. That’s right: Up by 8 percent this year, down by 4 percent next year. Now for the other asterisk to Burgin’s calculation. Property tax revenues are not a perfect measure of how taxes increased or decreased. That’s because the revenue includes property taxes collected from new construction. Owners of those properties may be paying more in taxes, but it’s a reflection of, say, their home sitting on what a year or two earlier may have been an orange grove. Take new construction out of the mix, particularly during the heady building days of Sharpe’s early tenure, and the alleged tax increase is something less than 8 percent, potentially much lower. Even during the anemic market of the current fiscal year, when property values are dropping across Hillsborough County, a projected $1.2 billion in new construction is expected. Burgin knows, or should know, his way around a budget book. He spent part of 2004 and 2005 as an aide to former County Commissioner Brian Blair, who tasked him with just these sorts of exercises. Fraud is a serious charge to level at anyone, even though some politicians tends to toss the word at opponents rather casually. Burgin has done it at least four times so far this campaign. But before accusing someone of an intentional perversion of the truth, it’s probably good to double- and triple-check the basis of your claim. We have no way of knowing if Burgin’s claim was an intentional distortion or an innocent miscalculation. Either way, we find this statement to be False.

pomt-00860	Says that "Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, has already conceded that Iran will have a robust uranium enrichment capability."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/16/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-says-susan-rice-conceded-under-nuclear-/	In the space of a few days, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. -- who only won his office four months ago -- became a central player in the drama over a potential nuclear deal with Iran. Cotton spearheaded a letter to Iran’s leaders that was ultimately signed by 47 Republican senators saying that Congress could ultimately overrule any agreement. Democrats said the letter undermined presidential authority to carry out foreign policy. On March 9, 2015, shortly after news of the letter broke, Cotton appeared on Fox News Channel and said this: "We don't know what the final terms of the deal are. But we know so far that Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, has already conceded that Iran will have a robust uranium enrichment capability. The president has said this bill will have a sunset, perhaps as little as 10 years (from now). Those two terms alone make this deal unacceptable." We see two related but distinct questions here. The first one is easier: Did Rice literally say what Cotton said she did? The second is trickier: Is what Rice said functionally equivalent to what Cotton claimed? Outline of the negotiations First, some background on the Iran nuclear negotiations. In November 2013, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany, known as the P5+1, joined with Iran in signing an agreement that temporarily stopped Iran’s production of potentially weapons-grade nuclear material. In 2014, that agreement was extended, with continued sanctions relief, including the ability to sell oil and to gain access to assets frozen in overseas bank accounts, and some additional nuclear steps by Iran. This interim agreement expires in June. Under the interim deal, Iran was cleared to continue enriching uranium, though only to the diluted level of 5 percent and with its stockpile capped. That falls well short of what weapon makers would need to create a bomb. On the other hand, critics of the deal say the first 5 percent enrichment is the toughest, meaning it would be comparatively easy for Iran to reach 90 percent once it got to 5 percent. Still, supporters of the administration’s approach counter that it would take Iran roughly a year to make a bomb, leaving time for the world to detect what’s happening and respond. Rice’s speech to AIPAC Cotton’s office didn’t return two inquiries, but we found a quote by Rice that seems to be the one Cotton is referencing; it attracted attention in both the conservative and mainstream media. Rice made the remarks in a March 2 speech to a convention of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential pro-Israel group that includes many skeptics of President Barack Obama’s approach: "We cannot let a totally unachievable ideal stand in the way of a good deal. I know that some of you will be urging Congress to insist that Iran forego its domestic enrichment capacity entirely. But, as desirable as that would be, it is neither realistic nor achievable. Even our closest international partners in the P5+1 (the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany) do not support denying Iran the ability ever to pursue peaceful nuclear energy. If that is our goal, our partners will abandon us, undermining the sanctions we have imposed so effectively together. Simply put, that is not a viable negotiating position. Nor is it even attainable. The plain fact is, no one can make Iran unlearn the scientific and nuclear expertise it already possesses." This makes it clear that Rice didn’t use the word "robust." Two arms-control experts agreed that Cotton was taking liberties with Rice’s words. "I think Cotton exaggerated what Rice said," said Richard Nephew, the program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. " 'Robust' has a connotation that, to me, means more than just a capability. I use the term ‘robust’ to mean ‘healthy’ or ‘strong.’ What exactly that means probably depends on the eye of the beholder, but to me, ‘robust’ evokes some real weight, which isn't what Rice said." Matthew Bunn, an arms-control specialist at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, agreed that Cotton was "clearly incorrect" in how he quoted Rice. "If this is the quote Cotton was referring to, he’s simply wrong about what she said. She said they won’t have zero, not that they will have a ‘robust’ capability," Bunn said. The White House told PolitiFact that Cotton embellished Rice’s words. "Our goal is to effectively shut down the four pathways to fissile material for a nuclear weapon: uranium enrichment at Natanz; uranium enrichment at Fordow; the plutonium pathway; and the possibility of a covert pathway," said National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan. "We seek to do this by extending Iran’s breakout time to at least one year – which is significantly longer than what experts have publicly estimated is Iran’s current breakout time of approximately two to three months." Was Cotton’s implication reasonable? Rice argued in her speech that it’s unrealistic to expect diplomacy to reduce Iran’s enrichment capability to zero. But do nuclear experts believe that any amount of enrichment capability greater than zero is inherently "robust"? Or is there a sweet spot between "zero" and "robust" in which Iran’s potential nuclear-bomb ambitions would be weakened to the point of inefficacy? The experts we checked with said there probably is such a sweet spot, but they cautioned that it’s hard to know for sure. Nephew and Bunn said the enrichment capabilities currently envisioned would, combined with the restrictions and monitoring established under the agreement, leave Iran with about a year’s work to make material for a bomb at its inspected facilities. That, Bunn argued, would give the world time to notice what’s going on and respond, and "would effectively take that option off the table for Iran." A greater risk, Bunn said, is that if Iran decides to go full-steam ahead on building a bomb, "it is far more likely to build a secret site for that purpose, rather than trying to do it with the world knowing what they are doing at facilities that could readily be bombed." To be sure, that’s a worrisome scenario -- but it’s also one that doesn’t depend on how much enrichment capability is allowed under the deal currently being negotiated. Ultimately, there are too many unknowns to say with any certainty how "robust" Iran’s enrichment capability would be -- starting with the fact that the negotiations are still ongoing, said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security. "The meaning of ‘robust’ is in the eye of the beholder," Albright said. "But knowing for sure who is right depends on knowing how much nuclear infrastructure will remain and what are the limits on its operation. We cannot know that for sure until we see a deal." Our ruling Cotton said, "Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, has already conceded that Iran will have a robust uranium enrichment capability." Cotton essentially puts words in Rice’s mouth when he says she "conceded" that Iran will keep a "robust" enrichment capability. She didn’t use those words in the AIPAC speech. Meanwhile, what she did say -- that zero enrichment capability, "as desirable as that would be, it is neither realistic nor achievable" -- may or may not lead to Cotton’s conclusion that Iran will be left with a "robust" capability. Experts expect that there is a point between "zero" and "robust" where Iran’s nuclear ambitions are hampered, but there are too many variables and too much uncertainty to say so with certainty. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.

pomt-10631	"I supported (the surge), I argued for it. I'm the only one on this stage that did."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/11/john-mccain/mccain-led-the-charge-but-he-wasnt-alone/	No candidate in the presidential race is more closely linked to President Bush's policy in Iraq than Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain. McCain's campaign nearly imploded last year — during some of the war's darker days — because of McCain's outspoken support for the president's troop surge policy, which was announced a year ago this month. But McCain was stretching the truth in a Jan. 10, 2008, Republican debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., when he said, in reference to the surge: "I supported that, I argued for it. I'm the only one on this stage that did." While McCain can make a case that he offered the strongest arguments in favor of the surge — and is now reaping the political benefits as violence has declined in Iraq — four of the other five candidates in the Fox News debate made arguments in favor of it. The one exception is Texas GOP Rep. Ron Paul, who supports an immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq. Three of the four remaining Republican candidates on the stage — Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Huckabee — supported the surge when it was announced and advanced arguments in its favor, although Huckabee expressed reservations early on. Now, he's an ardent surge backer. The final candidate, former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson, also spoke in favor of the surge when he joined the presidential race last summer. Romney in a statement released on the day Bush announced his surge policy said he agreed with the president that "securing Iraqi civilians requires additional troops." Later, in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in March 2007, he reiterated his support. Giuliani, likewise, put out an immediate statement endorsing the surge after Bush announced it. "I support the president's increase in troops. Even more importantly, I support the change in strategy — the focus on security and the emphasis on a political and economic solution as being even more important than a military solution." He, too, later made a speech in support of the surge. Thompson has been less clear in endorsing the surge. In an interview with the Hoover Institution's Peter Robinson in June, for example, he said the strategy in Iraq required evaluation on a "day-to-day basis." But he's always been forthright that he believes U.S. forces must remain in Iraq until the war is won and has repeatedly expressed confidence in Gen. David Petraeus, the surge's architect. Huckabee, who like McCain has accused fellow candidates of insufficient support for the troop surge, initially had qualms. Shortly after the surge was announced, for example, Huckabee told MSNBC's Norah O'Donnell that he wasn't sure he could support the troop increases in Iraq if it meant calling up more National Guard and Reserve forces. He now says he firmly supports Bush's military tactics in Iraq, and recently wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine that he would "not withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq any faster than General David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander there, recommends." There's no doubt that McCain is the surge's most powerful advocate among the candidates, and has been from the start. But to say that none of his fellow GOP candidates supported it, or argued in favor of it, is False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-01-11T00:00:00	2008-01-10	['None']

"Unbelievable: Navy destroyer strikes a building in downtown Houston," reads the headline on a Sept. 1, 2017, post on AmericanNews.com. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. "The city of Houston has already seen enough tragedy due to the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey, and unfortunately things took a turn for the worst today when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a building in the downtown area," the post read. The story, which was posted after Hurricane Harvey struck coastal Texas with record amounts of rain, noted it was unclear why the destroyer was 20 miles inland or how it struck an unidentified skyscraper (although it looks like the Heritage Plaza building). That’s because the entire incident is fake. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The story originated Aug. 29 on DuffelBlog.com, a site that posts satirical articles skewed to a military audience. For example, the site had a story that said the U.S. Army plans to move the entire South Korean capital of Seoul 300 miles south to ease tensions with the North. Another said the Navy plans to save money by giving up trying to rescue sailors who fall overboard. DuffelBlog.com’s disclaimer telegraphs its intent to resemble the satirical news website The Onion, and indicates its content is fake. "We are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet. Everything on this website is satirical and the content of this site is a parody of a news organization," the disclaimer reads. The photo in the post about Hurricane Harvey and the Navy destroyer does show the Houston skyline, but the image is a composite of a snapshot from a blog showing flooding in 2015 and a real destroyer, the USS Mustin. You can see the name written backward on the hull of the ship. In case you were wondering, the Mustin was not anywhere near Houston or the Gulf of Mexico. According to the ship’s Facebook page, the destroyer is part of the Seventh Fleet and is stationed in Japan.

pomt-10732	"As governor of Arkansas, I cut taxes and fees almost 100 times, saving the taxpayers almost $380-million. I left a surplus of nearly $850-million."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/14/mike-huckabee/a-nickel-and-dime-defense-/	Ever since setting up his committee to explore a run for the presidency, Mike Huckabee has been drawing fire from the fiscally conservative and very vocal Club for Growth. The nonprofit organization and its political action committee often target political candidates who don't live up to the group's standards of low taxes and low spending. In the presidential race, the club is giving special attention to Huckabee, going so far as to set up a Web site (www.taxhikemike.org) to post attacks on the former Arkansas governor's fiscal record. In the summer of 2007, the club ran a TV ad in Iowa comparing Huckabee to his Democratic predecessor Bill Clinton and calling him a "tax-and-spend liberal." Huckabee fired back with a press release: "As governor of Arkansas, I cut taxes and fees almost 100 times, saving the taxpayers almost $380-million. I left a surplus of nearly $850-million, which I urged should go back to the people. ... I pushed through the Arkansas Legislature the first major, broad-based tax cuts in state history – a $90-million tax relief package for Arkansas families." But Huckabee's response has glossed over some facts. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette , a Little Rock newspaper, examined the boast. The paper obtained a list of the near-100 tax cuts passed during the governor's tenure and found they included such small-change items as a sales-tax break for manufacturing machinery amounting to $500 a year and a tax exemption for county fairs that cost the state $15,000 a year. Whitney McLaughlin of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration confirmed the Democrat-Gazette's budget numbers for PolitiFact. During Huckabee's tenure, taxes or fees were cut 90 times, which did reduce tax revenue by about $380-million. The paper concluded that Huckabee doesn't deserve credit for all of those cuts, noting that all but one required a vote from the legislature, and most were the product of larger negotiations between the branches of government. The one tax cut Huckabee undoubtedly had his hands on was a $90.6-million income tax reduction enacted in his second year as governor. His administration did, as he says, leave the state with an $844.5-million budget surplus (as of March 2007) that the current government is now figuring out how to dispose of. And Huckabee did advocate for sending surplus rebates to taxpayers in 2006, when the year's surplus was expected to be $332-million. All of those Huckabee figures are correct. But, where did the money in that surplus come from? Mike Stormes, the state budget administrator, said the surplus was the result of "a conservative budget combined with a booming economy." The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration estimated that tax revenues grew by $505-million between 1997 and 2005. As governor, Huckabee supported a number of tax increases, including hikes in the state sales tax, a cigarette and tobacco tax and a nursing home bed tax, to name just a few. The per capita tax burden in state and local taxes rose in Arkansas by 47 percent between 1997 and 2005. Huckabee correctly toots his own horn about a major tax cut in his second year as governor and he did leave a big surplus when he left office.

pomt-07083	Says Rick Perry of Texas was "the governor who relied most on stimulus funds to close his state’s budget deficit in 2010."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/25/martin-omalley/democratic-governors-association-says-texas-gov-ri/	The day after Texas Gov. Rick Perry filled in for Donald Trump at a gathering of New York Republicans, Democratic Governors Association Chairman Martin O’Malley of Maryland poked at Perry’s anti-Washington message. Suggesting that President Barack Obama is tackling the nation’s economic problems with "responsible budget cuts" and "smart investments," O’Malley added: "As the governor who relied most on stimulus funds to close his state’s budget deficit in 2010, Rick Perry surely understands the value of the president’s investments." Perry was No. 1 in using federal stimulus aid to make the budget balance? It’s no secret that Texas, like other states, leaned heavily on stimulus aid in 2009, when lawmakers wrote the 2010-11 budget. Earlier this year, we rated Mostly True Obama’s statement that Perry "helped balance his budget with about $6 billion worth of federal help." State budget-writers in 2009 used $6.4 billion in stimulus aid, accepted by Perry, to help pay for programs over the next two years that historically had been financed with state revenue. O’Malley’s assertion, in contrast, focuses on how stimulus dollars were allocated in the first year of the state’s biennial budget cycle. To back up the statement, a Democratic Governors Association spokeswoman pointed us to a news article on CNN.com titled "Texas’s love/hate relationship with Washington’s money." The article says that Perry "likes to trumpet that his state balanced its budget in 2009 while keeping billions in its rainy day fund" but adds that Texas couldn’t have pulled that off without Washington’s help. "Turns out Texas was the state that depended the most on those very stimulus funds to plug nearly 97 percent of its shortfall for fiscal 2010," the article states, citing the National Conference of State Legislatures. The conference, which says online that it does research and advocacy for lawmakers in every state, included the 97 percent statistic in a July 2009 report on state budgets. The information was collected through a NCSL survey that, among other questions, asked states about "the major actions they took to close (fiscal year) 2010 budget gaps" and the relative share of the gap that each addressed. Stimulus aid proved a popular solution; without it, "state fiscal problems would have been even more severe," the report said. Among the 25 states that reported using stimulus money "as part of their solution," the report says the states depending most heavily on these funds were Texas (where the aid "represented 96.7 percent of the total solution") and Nebraska ("88 percent of the total solution"). We noticed a wrinkle. The NCSL analysis draws on information from just 35 states. Asked which states they are, Arturo Perez, director of the conference’s fiscal affairs program, told us by email that he couldn’t say. "We do not have the ability to identify which states were part of the original data set" because the database has been updated since the report was produced, he said. The report gives information for all 50 states in only one category: budget gap figures for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. For 2010, the report says, the Texas "budget gap" was $3.3 billion, or half "of an overall shortfall of $6.6 billion" for the 2010-11 biennium. Todd Haggerty, a policy analyst for the Denver- and Washington-based group, told us that the Texas information in the report was provided by the state’s Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. John Barton, a spokesman for the board, explained that the $6.6 billion biennial budget gap was calculated by subtracting available state revenue from what lawmakers actually spent. The stimulus money covered 96.7 percent of the difference, he said. Remember, that $6.6 billion is a two-year figure. For the 2010 budget gap, the Legislative Budget Board split the number in half and reported that the same percentage was filled by stimulus funds that year: 96.7 percent. The Legislature didn’t make any significant cuts or raise taxes in order to balance the 2010-11 budget, Barton said. We sought other studies that could help us assess the accuracy of O’Malley’s claim but came up short. Next, we tried to find out why Texas’ reliance on stimulus funds to balance its 2010 budget was higher than that of the other states in the NCSL report. We got this response from Mike Leachman, assistant director of the state fiscal project at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington: "It’s true that Gov. Perry relied on stimulus funding (to balance his budget). He accepted the vast majority of the stimulus money, just like any other governor, and that allowed Texas to avoid most or all of the cuts that otherwise might have needed to happen in the current budget cycle. But what’s not true is that he depended on it more than other governors. Every governor accepted virtually all of the stimulus money." Because the stimulus funds that helped states balance their budgets were keyed to such factors as population, Medicaid spending and unemployment rates — and not the size of a state’s budget gap — big states such as Texas generally had more at their disposal. (Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier made the same point in an email conversation with us.) How much a state relied on stimulus dollars to close its budget gap depended on the size of its shortfall, Leachman said. His point: The smaller the gap, the larger the amount that could be closed with stimulus dollars. Texas had a relatively small shortfall in 2010 — 10.7 percent of the state’s general revenue budget, according to the center’s data — compared with other states. (Only six states had smaller budget shortfalls by percentage of the state’s general fund budget, according to the center's data.) By contrast, in states with relatively large shortfalls — for example, New Jersey, whose 2010 budget gap constituted about 40 percent of its general fund budget, according to the center’s data — stimulus funds alone were not enough to balance the budget. In February 2009, then-Gov. Jon Corzine said stimulus dollars would cover only about half the 2010 gap, according to a Salon.com article. And in California, where the budget gap was more than 50 percent of the general fund budget, stimulus funds accounted for less than 15 percent of the total budget "solutions," according to an October 2009 report by the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. On average, states closed about a third of their 2010 shortfalls with stimulus funds, Leachman said. The remaining holes were closed by cutting spending, raising taxes and fees, tapping reserve funds and using one-time funding sources. We circled back to the Democratic Governors Association, explaining our findings. Spokeswoman Lis Smith stood by O’Malley’s statement. So, what about our rating? Based on available information, O’Malley’s claim is accurate, though the survey backing up his claim did not include results from 30 percent of the states. It’s possible that some of them relied on stimulus dollars to close their 2010 budget gaps to the same degree that Texas did — or greater. O’Malley’s statement also ignores the mathematical reality that Texas received a greater-than-most share of stimulus dollars to plug a budget shortfall that was smaller than most.

pomt-04914	"Under the Obama administration’s bailout of General Motors, Ohio dealerships were forced to close."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/02/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-ad-targets-obama-auto-bailouts-dealers/	Some things are so implicit there’s no need to elaborate. Darkness follows sunset. Children like ice cream. The 2009 auto bailout was better for some people than for others. What is missing from that last statement is blame, but the campaign of Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has made that implicit as well as explicit thanks to speeches, op-eds and interviews. It was President Barack Obama’s fault, says Romney, that the government brokered a bailout and bankruptcy plan for General Motors and Chrysler that had the government picking winners and losers. The government should have stayed out, Romney says. Which brings us to an Ohio-specific television commercial the Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee put on the air Wednesday. The short ad features Al Zarzour, a 61-year-old man from Lyndhurst who has spent decades in the auto industry. The ad doesn’t get this specific, but we know from coverage by The Plain Dealer and a telephone interview with Zarzour (who now is general manager of a Mitsubishi dealership) that he owned a Nissan dealership in Willoughby, sold it in 2006 and bought a Chevrolet dealership in Chardon. Both communities are in Greater Cleveland. What Zarzour says in the ad is, "Grew up here in Lyndhurst (another suburban community), started 1972, selling cars." Then an announcer says: "In 2009, under the Obama administration’s bailout of General Motors, Ohio dealerships were forced to close." PolitiFact Ohio took a look a that claim. Zarzour explains in the commercial that General Motors suspended his credit line, and how "we had 30-some employees that were out of work. My wife and I were the last ones there. It was like the dream that we worked for, and that we worked so hard for, was gone." The ad’s message? It’s not exactly stated. But it is implicit: People like Zarzour, his family and his employees were harmed by the Obama auto bailout. The bailout set the terms through which GM and Chrysler were to restructure. According to a White House fact sheet issued at the time, "There are some dealers that GM has identified that will not continue with GM. It is expected that the terminated dealers will be offered an agreement to orderly wind down their operations over the next 18 months." Kristen Dziczek, of the nonpartisan Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, says she recalls that there was a general agreement to cut the dealer base as part of White House-automaker discussions, but she doesn’t recall seeing official documents directing the extent of the cuts. But Alan Spitzer, a prominent Cleveland car dealer who helped lead the movement to save dealerships across the country, told us that GM and Chrysler had discussed closures in an earlier proposal to the Obama administration "and the White House pushed them to be more aggressive." The White House told PolitiFact Ohio that the specific decisions on those cuts came from the auto makers themselves and that it merely noted that the U.S. auto makers had substantially more dealers (on a per capita or sale basis) than their foreign competitors. Yet a special audit in mid-2010 by a federal inspector general for the bailout program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, noted exactly what Spitzer said: The auto companies already planned to cut dealerships, but the White House’s auto team believed the pace would be insufficient and told GM to accelerate dealer closings. Many authorities say the auto bailout, however painful, was necessary. Obama’s auto team believed that when it came to dealers specifically, under-performers created a drag on GM’s brand and hurt the prospects of stronger dealers, who could boost the company’s incremental sales. It’s important to know that when GM first presented its plan to the White House , it proposed getting rid of 1,650 dealerships by 2014, itself a continuation of dealer "right-sizing" that had been occurring since 1970. About 30 percent of the cuts would come from phasing out the Saturn, Saab and Hummer brands. But with the White House’s prompting, GM stepped up the closure dates to the end of 2010 -- while dropping the number of planned dealership terminations to 1,454. It cut the number but stepped up the pace, a fact that has been overlooked by many critics. Obama’s action "saved nearly a million jobs," White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday. Others have used a slightly higher figure. Obama campaign spokesman Frank Benenati said in an email that there are now 2,200 more people employed in Ohio auto dealerships than when Obama entered office. The Center for Automotive Research said in a 2010 report that the government-backed bankruptcy appeared to save 1.14 million jobs. But according to the special inspector general’s report, also in 2010, the Center for Automotive Research was critical of the closing of rural dealerships. It believed a customer would not drive 80 miles to another dealership to buy a Cadillac; the customer would find a closer store and buy a different car. Whether the non-government bankruptcy solution proposed by Romney, and supported by many other Republicans, would have worked cannot be known, because the Obama auto rescue went forward. Yet in a literal sense, the Romney ad’s statement is true. The Obama administration agreed to to provide loans to General Motors if GM, on the brink of failure, would restructure through bankruptcy. Part of the plan was for General Motors and Chrysler to downsize, at least temporarily, reduce their liabilities and change their way of doing business. Bankruptcy allowed GM to bypass state courts that could have made it harder to shed franchise agreements. The White House auto team pressed GM to act more quickly than it planned earlier, raising a possibility offered by the inspector general’s office: the number and speed of the terminations might not have been critical to GM’s viability. Yet even before the White House pressed it, GM was planning to cut dealership franchises. The Greater Cleveland Automobile Dealers’ Association told us that in the 19-county area of Northeast Ohio alone, 18 GM dealers and 12 Chrysler dealers closed. Even dealerships that were profitable had to close so GM could reconfigure its sales markets. Zarzour did not fight his dealership’s closing. "With the bankruptcy that went down, it didn’t seem like a good decision to stay there and fight it," he said when we contacted him. His equipment was sold at auction and he accepted a settlement with GM, the specifics of which he did not wish to discuss. "It wasn’t drastic," he said. The worst thing, he said, was having to put people out of work, watch the community lose a business that supported its schools and sports teams, and see his hopes of passing the business to his sons disappear. We asked Lou Vitantonio, president of the Greater Cleveland Automobile Dealers’ Association, if the closings were necessary. "Looking back, I don’t know if there’s a right or wrong decision," he said. "But this is where were at at this point: We lost 30 dealerships in our region." Yet if GM and Chrysler had closed even more factories because of financial failure, another 50 dealerships might be out of business today, he said. We also asked Zarzour. "That’s difficult for me to answer," he said. But he added, "I don’t think it was done properly." So, back to the ad’s specific claim: "In 2009, under the Obama administration’s bailout of General Motors, Ohio dealerships were forced to close." "There’s no doubt" that is an accurate statement, said Dino DiSanto, chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette, a Republican from Greater Cleveland who authored successful legislation allowing dealers to challenge their closings through arbitration. The full extent of those appeals are not yet known. PolitiFact evaluates political claims on words that are stated, but it also considers the context in which the words are uttered. Otherwise, you would have ads like, well, like this one, all of them entirely true. It is true that auto dealerships in Ohio closed as part of the bailout of General Motors. But the clear implication of the statement is that those closures were solely a result of the bailouts and might not have otherwise occurred. The statement on its surface is accurate, but that implication is not. While it is impossible to say which dealerships might have closed and which might have survived, General Motors was already working on a closure plan. In fact, even before the White House auto team asked it to be more aggressive, it submitted plans to shutter 1,650 dealers by the end of 2014. As for the government’s involvement, including loans, GM said it did not have a lot of other options so it stepped up the pace. In U.S. bankruptcy court filings, GM said it tried to find private investors but failed because lenders were not willing to take a risk on a damaged automaker amid a financial meltdown. Without funding, the company might have been forced to liquidate, selling off all its factories and equipment. That’s information that puts the claim into context. When a statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important information needed to put the claim in context, it gets one rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Half True.

pomt-08766	Kendrick Meek claims he's the only candidate who said Sonia Sotomayor "will make an excellent Supreme Court justice."	true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/25/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-only-big-3-us-senate-race-support-so/	Now that U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek has dispatched billionaire U.S. Senate Democratic rival Jeff Greene, Meek is quickly pivoting to a general election campaign where he will face Republican Marco Rubio and a former Republican, Gov. Charlie Crist. That means Meek will do everything he can between now and Nov. 2, 2010, to distinguish himself from his two opponents. At his Aug. 24, 2010, primary victory speech at the Westin Diplomat in Hollywood, Meek labeled his two major fall opponents conservative. He repeated a claim that PolitiFact Florida ruled Mostly True, that he is the only candidate who has consistently opposed additional offshore oil drilling. And he also talked about the 2009 Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor. "I will be the only candidate, ladies and gentlemen, that stood in there with Justice Sotomayor," said Meek, surrounded by his family and supporters. "When she was up for her nomination, I stood up and said she was the right selection and she will make an excellent Supreme Court justice." This fact check is pretty straightforward: Does the record support Meek's claim? President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court on May 26, 2009. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Aug. 6, 2009. Here's what the three major candidates said about Sotomayor that summer. Kendrick Meek -- Meek joined Puerto Rican leaders in Miami on June 1 to support Sotomayor's nomination to the country's highest court. On June 2, he attended a similar event in Orlando. "She is an outstanding candidate for the Supreme Court," Meek said in Orlando. There is no record of him wavering from that position. Marco Rubio -- Rubio, meanwhile, is on record opposing the Sotomayor nomination. He wrote an Aug. 5 column published by Politico titled "Opposing the philosophy of Sonia Sotomayor isn't anti-Hispanic." Rubio wrote: "During the recent Judiciary Committee hearings, it became clear that I could not in good conscience support Sotomayor's confirmation and would vote against it if I were in the Senate today ... As a whole, Sotomayor's record reflects a view that judges can and should inject personal experiences and biases into what should be the objective interpretation and application of the law." Charlie Crist -- On July 21, Crist also came out against Sotomayor's confirmation. At that point, Crist was still a Republican. "While I have not had the opportunity to meet personally with Judge Sotomayor -- a crucial step in the selection process -- I have reviewed and reflected upon her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and come to the conclusion that I cannot support her appointment to the United States Supreme Court," Crist said. "Judge Sotomayor is worthy of respect for her many accomplishments and her remarkable story of success. However, I have strong concerns that Judge Sotomayor would not strictly and objectively construe the constitution and lacks respect for the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. For these reasons, I cannot support her appointment to the highest court in the land." In a May 2010 interview with the Miami Herald, no-party candidate Crist continued to say that he would have opposed Sotomayor over questions about the Second Amendment, though he could not recall specifically what those questions were. The fall ballot will include more names than just Meek, Rubio and Crist. But we couldn't find statements on Sotomayor from any of the minor or no-party candidates. None of those candidates has received more than 5 percent in any recent statewide poll. In his primary victory speech, Meek said that he is the only candidate who publicly supported Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. Compared to Crist and Rubio, the two other major candidates, Meek is right. We rate his statement True.	None	Kendrick Meek	None	None	None	2010-08-25T16:20:55	2010-08-24	['Sonia_Sotomayor']
pomt-00849	"A few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/20/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-barack-obama-took-iran-hamas-us-te/	The confluence of elections in Israel and the possible culmination of international talks on Iran’s nuclear capabilities has vaulted United States policy on Iran to the top of the national agenda. A reader emailed us to note that on March 19, 2015, Glenn Beck -- a multiplatform commentator on the right -- took to Facebook to criticize President Barack Obama’s handling of policy with Iran. Here’s the beginning of the lengthy Facebook post: "This is just Evil," Beck wrote, "A few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list. He is negotiating with Iran WHILE their supreme leader said that they ‘will fly the Islamic flag of jihad over the White House.’ … Christians are being liquidated, beheaded and crucified, their children being sold into slavery, his big bombing plan to stop Isis is SEVEN bombing runs a day. 7!!! How many did we run in Bosnia: 165?!!!" Beck makes a number of claims in this short snippet, but the one that jumped out at us was that "a few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list." By diplomatic standards, that would be a pretty big deal, especially if it was a unilateral move before a major nuclear deal was even completed. And we certainly hadn’t seen any media coverage about this happening. Did Obama really take Hamas and Iran off the terror list? The short answer is no. Here’s the long answer. The State Department lists The most signifcant "terror lists" are the ones maintained by the State Department. One is for "state sponsors of terrorism." This includes countries "determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism," and inclusion on the list establishes restrictions on foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, and a variety of financial and other restrictions. Currently, four nations are on the list: Cuba, Sudan, Syria … and Iran, which has been on the list since Jan. 19, 1984, when Ronald Reagan was president. Nothing with this status has changed in the last few weeks. The second State Department list includes "foreign terrorist organizations." Under United States law, it is unlawful to knowingly provide "material support or resources" to a group on the list. Other restrictions on financing and immigration come into play as well. Hamas -- a militant Islamic movement based in the Palestinian territories -- is on this list, and has been since Oct. 8, 1997, when Bill Clinton was president. Like Iran, it has not been taken off the relevant terror list. So what is Beck talking about? The Clapper report We failed to reach Beck through a representative of his radio network, but judging by previous posts in the conservative blogosphere, we believe he was referring to the 2015 report by the director of national intelligence, James Clapper. Clapper presented the annual report -- "Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community" -- to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Feb. 26. The report is divided into two parts "global threats" and "regional threats." The global section include such topics as cyber threats, counterintelligence, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, space, organized crime, global economics and natural resources. The regional section covers most parts of the world, including the Middle East and north Africa. Most of the recent discussion of the Clapper report on the Internet stemmed from a Hebrew-language analysis by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, an Israeli think tank considered close to the country’s military and intelligence sectors. The center’s analysis received coverage in the Israeli media and then quickly spread to the United States. The center’s analysis noted that the "terrorism" section in the 2014 report mentioned both Iran and Hezbollah, but the 2015 section did not. Before we go any further, we’ll note that Beck wrote "Hamas" in his Facebook post when he presumably meant "Hezbollah," a predominantly Lebanese Shiite Muslim party and militant group that is backed by Iran and that has been on the State Department terrorism list since 1997. While Hamas was not mentioned in either of the past two Clapper reports, Hezbollah was mentioned in the terrorism section of the 2014 report but not in the terrorism section in the 2015 report. The conservative blog posts that preceded Beck's post correctly cited "Hezbollah," so we’ll chalk this up to carelessness. Now let’s take a closer look at what changed between the two reports. The strongest evidence for Beck is the disappearance of the following language, which had been included in the terrorism section of the 2014 report: "Iran and Hizbullah are committed to defending the Asad regime and have provided support toward this end, including sending billions of dollars in military and economic aid, training pro-regime and Iraqi Shia militants, and deploying their own personnel into the country. Iran and Hizbullah view the Asad regime as a key partner in the ‘axis of resistance’ against Israel and are prepared to take major risks to preserve the regime as well as their critical trans-shipment routes. Outside the Syrian theater, Iran and Lebanese Hizbullah continue to directly threaten the interests of U.S. allies. Hizbullah has increased its global terrorist activity in recent years to a level that we have not seen since the 1990s." The 2015 report only mentions Hezbollah once, and it’s in passing. Still, we should note that the 2015 report hardly lets Iran off the hook. The report accuses Iran of: • "Preserving (the) nuclear weapons option," • Remaining "an ongoing threat to US national interests because of its support to the Asad regime in Syria, promulgation of anti-Israeli policies, development of advanced military capabilities, and pursuit of its nuclear program," • "Pursuing policies with negative secondary consequences for regional stability and potentially for Iran," • And pursuing actions to protect and empower Shia communities that "are fueling growing fears and sectarian responses." Administration officials cautioned against over-reading the choices made in Clapper’s written report. "There is no change in the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment of the threat posed by Iran or Hezbollah," said Brian P. Hale, the director of public affairs in the office of the director of national intelligence. The report, Hale said, "was written to be an overview of top threats. … There were a lot of topics to consider this year -- ISIL, cyber, Ukraine-Russia, etc. Iran was included, too." Hale added that Clapper fleshed out the national-security concerns about Iran and Hezbollah during testimony at the Senate hearing. Responding to a question from Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., Clapper cited several entities linked to Iran, including Hezbollah, as methods for Iran to use as "a physical manifestation of their spreading their influence in the region." And Nick Rasmussen -- director of the National Counterterrorism Center, the principal adviser to Clapper’s office on intelligence operations and counterterrorism analysis -- testified on Feb. 12 that "beyond their role in Syria and Iraq, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah remain committed to conducting terrorist activities worldwide, and we are concerned their activities could either endanger or target U.S. and other Western interests." Reading between the lines We see two questions here. First, is it valid for him to call the Clapper report "the terror list"? And second, are the changes in the 2015 report -- the basis for his otherwise inaccurately worded claim -- noteworthy? On the first question, experts agreed that the phrase "terror list" is typically reserved for the one with the legal bite -- the State Department’s. Beck has "no justification for calling it 'the terror list,' " said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a Middle East expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. On the second question, Beck may have a point, said Rick Brennan, a senior political scientist with RAND Corp. "The entire tenor of the 2015 report on terrorism focuses on Sunni terrorist organizations, and there is no mention of Shia terrorist organizations," Brennan said. "The reality is that that Islamist terrorism has both a Sunni and Shia variant. Focusing on one part of the problem and excluding the other is not analytically accurate." Brennan added that he doesn’t see any sign that Iran has "changed its behavior in exporting violence throughout the region" between 2014 and 2015, which raises the question of why the report "significantly softened the tone and tenor of the assessment" of Iran and Hezbollah. However, Beck buried this more justifiable point under several errors and hyperbole. Our ruling Beck said, "A few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list." Beck made a few clear mistakes here. First, it appears he mistook Hamas for Hezbollah. Second, Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah remain on the official, and legally binding, State Department terror lists, as they have for decades. Obama did nothing to change that "a few weeks ago." Beck's claim is inaccurate, so we rate it False.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2015-03-20T09:39:08	2015-03-19	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-11845	"There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/alyssa-milano/alyssa-milano-no-background-checks-texas-long-gun-/	Actress Alyssa Milano drew attention to gun background checks after a shooting at a Texas church left at least 26 people dead. "There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas. Thanks for the info @shannonrwatts," Milano tweeted on Nov. 5, crediting for the information Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, an organization seeking stronger gun laws. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com By mid-day Nov. 6, Milano’s message had been retweeted more than 3,200 times and "liked" by more than 7,800 Twitter users. Given the controversial national discourse on gun control, we wanted to know if Milano was right about background checks and long guns in Texas. We found her tweet to be partly accurate: licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers must conduct a background check for the transfer of all firearms, but private sellers are not required to run such background checks. We reached out to Milano for comment but did not hear back. Texas shooting and gun background checks Law enforcement officials identified 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley as the gunman who killed 26 people and injured 20 others at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 5. Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a Nov. 6 press conference that the shooting was not over religious beliefs. The suspect’s mother-in-law attended the church (though not present during the shooting) and had received threatening texts from Kelley. "There was a domestic situation going on with this family," Martin said. Kelley dropped a "Ruger AR assault-type rifle" and fled the church, according to Martin. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle after a car chase and crash. Details on the cause of his death are developing. Milano tweeted that in Texas there are no background checks on long guns, such as AR-15-style rifles. (AR-15-style rifles look like military rifles "but function like other semi-automatic civilian sporting firearms, firing only one round with each pull of the trigger," according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation.) Texas does not have a state law requiring any seller to run a background check on purchasers of any gun, said Ari Freilich, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. But there is federal law requiring background checks in some cases, she said. "Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers to run background checks before selling firearms of any kind to an unlicensed buyer," Freilich said. However, unlicensed, private sellers are not required by federal law to run background checks on individuals purchasing firearms. Many Twitter users pointed out this distinction to Milano. Appearing to have noticed the challenges to her claim, Milano tweeted less than two hours later: "Background checks aren’t REQUIRED in Texas on long guns. If you buy from Walmart, they’ll do one. If you buy privately they don’t have to." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Watts, whom Milano credited for her information, also later specified in tweets that no background checks were required for private sales of long guns. Some states do have restrictions on the private sale of firearms. For instance, in California such sales must be done through a licensed dealer. A study published in January 2017 asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. Twenty-two percent said they obtained their gun without a background check. Our ruling Milano tweeted, "There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas." Federal law does require background checks when a firearm is sold or transferred by licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers. That includes long guns. But private, unlicensed sellers are not required to conduct background checks under federal or Texas law, even though other states have added requirements to that effect. Milano noted these distinctions in a follow-up tweet, but her original tweet lacked important context. We rate Milano’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-02793	"Residents could have received nearly $48M for Local Schools, Fire District, Sheriff’s Dept. and Social Services."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/04/freedom-and-responsibility-pac/could-clackamas-county-residents-have-received-nea/	Local governments have long relied on urban renewal districts to redevelop blighted areas. The districts temporarily freeze the amount of property taxes collected for public services such as police, fire protection and schools, then redirect the money to improvement projects inside the district. The tax base is unfrozen when the district ends, allowing public service providers to begin collecting taxes on the new, higher property values. Urban renewal has become a hot-button issue. Critics, including some in Clackamas County, say it gives government unchecked power to spend money without sufficient oversight and that it amounts to a giveaway to developers. Clackamas County Commissioner Paul Savas, who is running for re-election, was targeted in a recent flier from the Tigard-based Freedom and Responsibility PAC. The flier, among other things, said Savas helped table a motion under which "Residents could have received nearly $48M for Local Schools, Fire District, Sheriff’s Dept. and Social Services." The flier noted that the money would have come from the Clackamas Town Center Urban Renewal District, which formed in 1980 and ended in June with money left over. With local service providers seemingly straining for every cent these days, we decided to check whether Savas actually voted to deny them $48 million in unspent urban renewal money. According to the flier, here’s where most of that money would have gone if not for Savas’ vote: $20 million to the North Clackamas School District; $8 million to Clackamas Fire District #1; $8 million to the Sheriff’s Office; and $8 million to Clackamas County’s general fund. The remaining $4 million, according to county documents, would go to the other 13 overlapping taxing entities that operated within the urban renewal district. We called Savas, who was part of a 3-2 majority that voted to table a motion to return the $48 million in unspent urban renewal district money. It made sense, he said, to use the unspent money on needed but not yet approved projects in the district. Shortly after tabling the motion, the board, by the same 3-2 split, authorized two road projects inside the district totaling $9.2 million. A discussion is set for early next year on what to do with the remaining $38.8 million. Savas took issue with two of the flier’s key points: that the money could have been returned to "residents" and that $48 million was eligible for return. He cited an email from Clackamas County Assessor Bob Vroman noting that Oregon law prohibits returning unspent urban renewal money directly to citizens. Instead, it has to go back to the individual service providers. State officials confirmed that prohibition. So residents would not have gotten a kicker-style check. On the other hand, taxpayers are residents, and they would have seen a benefit had agencies they support received millions of dollars. On the other point, Savas said his vote actually saved Clackamas County residents nearly $20 million. Why? Because the $20 million claimed on the flier as destined for the North Clackamas School District actually would have gone to the State School Fund. Savas forwarded an email from Michael Wiltfong, the Oregon Department of Education’s school finance director, who estimated that the North Clackamas District would have gotten only $600,000 of that $20 million. Information compiled by the county put the figure closer to $330,000. As for the flier’s other claims: $8 million for "Fire": Information compiled by Dan Johnson, the county Development Agency’s manager, sets the figure at $6.95 million. $8 million for "Sheriff": Johnson’s number is $4 million, but there’s a big caveat. The money would go only to the Clackamas County Enhanced Law Enforcement District, which provides services only for unincorporated Clackamas County and the cities of Happy Valley and Johnson City. $8 million for "Clackamas County": This refers to the county’s general fund. Johnson’s number is $7.8 million -- the same if rounded up. We called Richard Burke, treasurer for the Freedom and Responsibility PAC, for a response. "I recognize that only a portion of this money would go to local schools," said Burke, a self-professed Libertarian who lives in Beaverton. "But I stand behind my point that there’s a pot of money that could have gone back to taxing districts if not for Paul’s vote." In a followup email, Burke defended his $8 million figure for the sheriff, citing Sheriff Craig Roberts’ comments during budget hearings this year that his office was likely to get a good chunk of the $7.8 million headed to the general fund -- if commissioners had voted to return the money. But even if the money had gone to the fund, a sheriff’s office spokesman said, it would have been a "commissioners’ decision on how to spend it." The flier lists four figures. One -- the amount that would have gone to the general fund -- was accurate, and another -- the amount for fire services -- wasn’t far off. The figure given for the sheriff’s office was inaccurate and oversimplified, though, and the figure for schools was wrong in amount and recipient. On the other point, residents would have seen a benefit from the return of the money, but it wouldn’t have been given directly to them. We rate the claim Mostly False because it contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts.	None	Freedom and Responsibility PAC	None	None	None	2013-12-04T15:10:01	2013-11-25	['None']
pomt-02151	"Residential property taxes [in Providence] are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2014/may/04/gina-raimondo/gina-raimondo-says-providence-taxes-rose-nearly-27/	Read our lips: If you want to win an election, accuse your opponent of raising taxes. So it wasn't surprising when Gina Raimondo, Rhode Island's general treasurer and candidate for governor, accused one of her Democratic primary opponents, Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, of overseeing a hefty tax increase. On April 28, 2014, the Raimondo campaign issued a news release headlined, "Just the Facts: As Providence families pay their property taxes, residential property taxes are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras." "Under Mayor Taveras," it said, "residential property taxes were raised two separate times: by 5 percent in FY 2012 and by 20.7 percent in FY 2014. In total, residential property taxes, which hit working families hard, are up 26.7 percent since 2011." The news release even included footnotes that cite the pages in the city's budgets that supported the argument. The Taveras campaign quickly fired back that the allegation was wrong and the average increase for 2014 was about 6 percent, not 20.7 percent. We donned our referee jersey and decided to use the Truth-O-Meter to see who was correct. The references in the news release sent us to two Providence budgets. Raimondo spokesman Eric Hyers said we should be looking at the tax rates. In the 2012 budget, on page 137, the tax rate for homeowners goes from $15.19 to $15.94, a 4.9 percent increase. The following year, the tax rate remained the same. But in the 2014 budget, on page 161, the rate jumps to $19.25, for an increase of 26.7 percent over three years. "We said tax rates are up 26 percent, which is totally, totally accurate," said Hyers. But on the same page of the 2014 budget, it notes that the new budget is based on an updated estimate of property values in the city, and residential property values decreased by an average of 13.2 percent. Readers who don't immediately understand why this throws a ridiculously-large monkey wrench into Raimondo's claim need to realize how property tax rates are calculated. The amount you pay depends on how many thousands of dollars your property is worth. If your house and land are worth $100,000 and the tax rate is set at $22 per thousand, your bill will be $2,200, or $100 times $22. In Rhode Island, every community is required to reassess the value of all of its properties every three years. When that revaluation occurs, the tax rate will usually go up or down depending on whether property values fall or rise, even if government spending -- and the average tax bill -- doesn't change from year to year. Comparing tax rates in isolation before and after a revaluation ignores half the equation. When residential property values decline by 13.2 percent, you have to increase your tax rate by a hefty amount if you want to raise the same amount of revenue that you did the previous year. In that case, the average tax bill remains the same. (On a case-by-case basis, the people in areas of the city where their property values rose will see an increase and homeowners living where property values fell will see their tax bill drop. That's what happened in Providence, although the average homeowner increase on individual tax bills was 4.8 percent.) In short: a tax rate -- by itself -- becomes a meaningless number when a municipality has readjusted the value of its tax base. When you take Providence’s revaluation into consideration, a homeowner whose property value went from $150,000 to $130,200 after revaluation saw a tax increase of 10 percent over the three-year period Raimondo is talking about, not 26 or 27 percent, according to our calculation based on city data. We asked Hyers if the Raimondo campaign had realized there had been a revaluation. He said the campaign knew, but it wasn't relevant to the news release. "We're talking about rates," he said. "The math is very simple. We are not trying to claim, and you will never hear me try to claim, that tax bills are up 27 percent. We've never said that the bills went up 27 percent. All we're saying is that the rates have gone up 27 percent." But contrary to Hyers’ assertion, the Raimondo news release never uses the word "rate." And it does say the tax bills went up 27 percent. It even quotes Hyers as saying, "Providence property taxes are skyrocketing." Our ruling In a news release, State Treasurer Gina Raimondo said, "Residential property taxes [in Providence] are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras." If Raimondo had consistently said that the tax rate had increased nearly 27 percent, PolitiFact Rhode Island would have viewed this claim differently. But the Raimondo "Just the Facts" news release misstates the facts, claiming taxes increased by nearly 27 percent. That's a ridiculous assertion, especially coming from the campaign of the current general treasurer, who is also a finance expert and presumably understands municipal finance.

pomt-05884	"Private prisons do not chase escaped inmates past the perimeter like the public prisons do, which means more escaped prisoners in our communities."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/07/chain-email/do-private-prisons-chase-escaped-inmates/	Prison breaks are the stuff of movies: toothbrushes fashioned into wall-chipping chisels, bed sheets braided into escape ropes, secret routes to the outside via ceilings and pipes. While the resourcefulness of desperate inmates can be impressive, there's also a scary side. Opponents of the Florida Legislature's prison privatization plan have tapped into this fear, warning that if the plan is successful, more criminals will end up on the lam. "Did you know that private prisons do not chase escaped inmates past the perimeter like the public prisons do, which means more escaped prisoners in our communities?" wrote Christina Bullins, a South Florida correctional probation officer. Bullins wrote an email dated Jan. 30, 2012, that was distributed by the liberal group MoveOn.org. It urged people to sign a petition against the plan. The claim that private prisons don’t chase inmates seems widely held among state-paid correctional officers and privatization opponents. They warn that public safety is at risk, and the state could see more incidents like in 2010, when three inmates in Arizona escaped a privatized facility with the help of a faulty alarm system, lax guard patrols and a propped-open door. The trio, two of whom were convicted murderers, were connected to the murder of a New Mexico couple following their breakout. We wondered if private prisons really are more restricted in chasing escapees. What we thought would be an easy policy check quickly turned into an all-out truth chase. If you pose the question to correctional officers and their union reps, you get an unequivocal yes. Ask their private-sector counterparts and you get an unequivocal no. Outside experts are divided, and we ourselves were baffled by ambiguous statutes and redacted security policies. What the companies say We asked three companies that run private prisons in Florida -- Corrections Corp. of America, Management & Training Corp., and the GEO Group -- if their policies allow for employees to cross the perimeter in pursuit of an inmate. CCA spokesman Steve Owen said his company does. That's expected of a facility, per their state contract, he said. But employees are told to notify local sheriff's deputies or police about escapees, he said. "At some point ... it makes more sense for local authorities to pursue the inmate," Owen said. There's never been an escape at Gadsden Correctional Institution, said Management & Training Corp. spokesman Issa Arnita, but Gadsden correctional officers "have authority to pursue escaped inmates beyond prison grounds." A spokesman for the GEO Group said their private prisons operate similarly to public prisons. But he also said company policy prevents him from sharing specific security policies and procedures. "Correctional facilities operated by GEO and other firms are contractually required to follow the same operational procedures and policies that are followed by prisons operated by the state," said spokesman Pablo Paez. What state law says We then turned to state law, which presented more ambiguity. The law states "a private correctional officer may use force only while on the grounds of a facility, while transporting inmates, and while pursuing escapees from a facility." Private officers are also allowed to use non-deadly force to prevent an inmate from committing a felony or misdemeanor, which includes escape. Another law requires all prison officers and correctional officers to immediately arrest a convict who escapes. Officers or guards "may call upon the sheriff or other officer of the state" or of any county or municipality to search for and arrest convicts. Several experts told us that it’s not clear from these statutes that private guards have outright authority to chase after inmates beyond the property line. The first rule seems to imply it, but it does not specifically address what happens off prison property. "In my opinion that’s part of the problem with the privatization of prisons," said Michael Hallett, a University of North Florida criminal justice professor who has written extensively on privatization and is opposed to the Senate plan. "It blurs the line between the state and a private party." What the contracts say Next, we turned to the contracts between private prisons and the state to see how escapes are handled. PolitiFact Florida reviewed contracts for each of the state's seven currently privatized prisons, and those contracts contain requirements for security and emergency plans. Those policies are redacted from public review, however, due to security concerns. Republican Sen. Mike Fasano, who was removed from his longtime post atop the budget subcommittee for criminal justice programs for his adamant opposition, said he’s never heard of a company agreeing to go beyond their property in the pursuit of an inmate. Unlike the state, which is protected from lawsuits under "sovereign immunity," private operators would not be protected from lawsuits if something went wrong in a chase. "If he hurts somebody and gets sued, he's on his own," said Ken Kopczynski, director of research at the Police Benevolent Association, the officers' former longtime union. With that kind of burden, private prison vendors would call local public law enforcement for assistance, Kopczynski said. The vendors also have agreements with the Department of Corrections to bring in help in cases of escape, riot and hostage situations. PolitiFact Florida reviewed these agreements and found the state's help includes canine tracking teams, hostage negotiators and other emergency response teams upon the request of the private vendor. In Palm Beach County, home to GEO Group-operated South Bay prison, deputies would react to an escape with dog teams, horses, helicopters and patrols, said county sheriff's office spokesman Eric Davis. But they would do that for any escape, private or public alike, he said. "It’s not like guards are going to leave the facility unmanned (in a pursuit). That’s not how it goes," Davis said. Prison breakouts by the numbers State legislators who heard these arguments in debate were concerned enough to add an amendment to the legislation. The most recent version of the bill says contractors must pay the state for costs "associated with the pursuit or apprehension of an escapee" for the first 48 hours of the inmate's escape. Senators wanted to be sure state and local governments would not be on the hook if prisoners slipped through private facilities, which has happened in the past, Hallett said. Before we rule, we should note an important caveat to this discussion: Prison breakouts are not very common. Opponents’ evidence that privatization will lead to neighborhood chaos is anecdotal. The reason they envision more breakouts is that private prisons offer lower starting salaries and benefits, leading to high turnover and less experience. There were 167 escapes in Florida from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011, none of which were from inside a private or public correctional facility, according to the most recent state figures available. The majority of escapes are hardly the stuff of The Shawshank Redemption. Most involve inmates simply walking away from road prisons and work release. The last true prison break was in 2005 when three Dade Correctional Institution inmates built a ladder, tossed a sheet of carpet over the barbed-wire fence and climbed over, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. They stole a truck at knifepoint and remained free for about an hour -- until their vehicle plunged into a canal during a chase by police. That was at a public prison, by the way. Our ruling Private prison vendors say they have the authority to chase escaped prisoners beyond their property lines. Without getting into detailed security procedures, they say they have the same authority as public corrections officials. We've seen nothing to contradict those statements, but we’ve also seen nothing that strongly supports them, thanks to public records exemptions on their security plans. Even if they can pursue past their property lines, does that mean they will? The vendors say part of their escape plan is to immediately notify local authorities. The authorities we consulted said they would definitely take the lead if a prisoner went off campus, but they added that would be the case for a state-run facility, too. That brings us to the final part of the claim: This chase policy will result in "more escaped prisoners in our communities." While there are definitely horror stories resulting from inmate escapes, we don’t see the evidence that there are more escapes from private prisons. We would consider this point speculative. The email said, "Private prisons do not chase escaped inmates past the perimeter like the public prisons do, which means more escaped prisoners in our communities." We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14137	ColoradoCare would have higher revenues than McDonald’s.	mostly true	/colorado/statements/2016/may/04/colorado-health-institute/report-says-coloradocare-would-have-higher-revenue/	An independent analysis says Colorado's proposed universal health care system would have $38 billion in projected revenues -- dwarfing Fortune 500 companies like McDonald's, Nike and American Express. The report, by the Colorado Health Institute, is a primer on the potential benefits and drawbacks of ColoradoCare, a proposed state health care cooperative that would resemble single-payer health care systems like those in Canada and Europe. Coloradans will decide whether to create the giant system when they vote on Amendment 69 in the November election. "Supporters estimate ColoradoCare would have $38 billion in annual revenues," the report states. "If it were a private company, ColoradoCare would rank about 80th in the Fortune 500, just behind New York Life Insurance and ahead of well­-known companies such as American Express, 21st Century Fox, 3M, Sears, Nike and McDonald's." Need more perspective? Colorado's annual state budget is $25.7 billion. We examined the statement that ColoradoCare’s projected revenues would be $38 billion and overshadow huge corporates. We found that the number is right in theory, but it depends on the federal government signing off on a first-of-its-kind health system for Colorado. How ColoradoCare would work First, here’s how ColoradoCare would work. If approved by voters, Colorado would be the first state to have a health care system where every resident has coverage financed by taxes instead of private insurance premiums, according to the Colorado Health Institute report. The institute estimates that 83 percent of Colorado’s population -- about 4.4 million people -- would be eligible for primary health insurance coverage through ColoradoCare. The remaining 17 percent of residents would continue to be covered by federal programs, including Medicare and the Veterans Administration. People would still choose their own health care providers, but ColoradoCare would pay the bills. Members would not have to pay an annual deductible, but they would have co-pays. The system would be controlled by a powerful 21-member board, elected by the system’s members in seven districts across the state. The governor and legislature would have no role, except to select an interim board until elections were held. An economic analysis by supporters says ColoradoCare would produce a net savings of $4.5 billion for residents and businesses by eliminating private insurance profits, streamlining paperwork and more efficiently delivering services. Opponents say the proposed amendment will be costly, it won't impact rising health care costs and it will hamper the state’s ability to attract and retain medical providers. The ColoradoCareYes campaign confirmed the proposed nonprofit health system is projected to have $38 billion in annual revenues. About $25 billion would come from state taxes. Employers would pay 6.67 percent in payroll taxes and employees would contribute 3.33 percent, for a total of 10 percent of the payroll. Self-employed people would pay 10 percent of their net income. The projected $25 billion in tax revenues have been independently confirmed by an economist at the Colorado Legislative Council, which provided a revenue impact report to the state board that reviews the language and legality of an initiative's ballot title and summary. For the rest of its annual revenues, supporters say ColoradoCare would apply for waivers from the federal government, so that ColoradoCare takes over the state roles and funding for Medicaid ($10.8 billion) and the Affordable Care Act ($700 million). Out-of-pocket costs for medical care and dental care would each provide an estimated $1 billion. But experts said obtaining the federal waivers is a challenging process -- and there’s no certainty of success. Beginning on Jan. 1, states can apply for a federal waiver to create innovative, alternative health care programs that would take the place of the Affordable Care Act -- while staying true to its goals. ColoradoCare would have to pass a rigorous federal review, showing it would deliver coverage that's at least as comprehensive and affordable as the so-called Obamacare program, while covering the same amount of people. ColoradoCare would have to stay "revenue neutral" and not cost more than the existing federal program. Federal waivers, funding ‘not a sure thing’ What are the chances of obtaining the waivers and the federal funds that go with them? "Definitely, I would say it’s not a sure thing," said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who specializes in health care reform, an issue she worked on for both the administrations of President Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton. Yet, if approved by voters, ColoradoCare would be among the first states to seek an Affordable Care Act (ACA) waiver and bring "the most far-reaching health care reform in any state since the ACA," according to the Colorado Health Institute report. "There's advantages for being the first one in the door. It lets you kind of establish the framework for the debate that's going follow," Pollitz said. Medicaid waivers aren’t automatic, either, though several states, including Colorado, have received the so-called 1115 waivers -- named for a Section 1115 of the Social Security Act "1115 waivers require a lot of work and back-and-forth between the state and the federal government and compliance with a number of criteria, including budget neutrality," said Elisabeth Arenales, the health care program director for the Colorado Center on Law and Policy. The center hasn't reviewed or taken a position on Amendment 69. "States have to be careful in how they negotiate those waivers because they're essentially locked into a spending contract, and they need to be very mindful that they're both not costing the federal government any additional money but also that their projections of state spending are accurate," Arenales said. The ballot initiative’s language makes it clear that getting the waivers are a do-or-die matter for ColoradoCare. No waivers means no program. Under the heading "Termination of ColoradoCare’s Operations," the initiative states: "If the board determines that ColoradoCare has not received the waivers, exemptions, and agreements from the federal government sufficient for its fiscally sound operation, the board shall: (a) shut down operations and return unused funds; (b) notify the governor of the State of Colorado of ColoradoCare's inability to function." ColoradoCareYES campaign spokesman Owen Perkins acknowledged the waivers’ critical importance. "ColoradoCare doesn't move forward without that," he said. But, at the same time, he said it should be reassuring to Colorado voters that health care system couldn’t launch until it passes a high bar set by the federal government. "I think everybody in Colorado should be thankful that there is that vigorous standard," Perkins said. "That ensures that we can't go into this willy-nilly. It could pass with a 75-percent vote and everything look perfect, but if it doesn't receive that waiver, it's not going to happen." He stressed that the architects of ColoradoCare have done their homework. The Colorado Health Institute is accurate in saying, given ColoradoCare’s projected $38 billion in revenues, if it were a private company is would rank about 80th on the Fortune 500 just behind New York Life Insurance ($38.7 billion in revenues). It’s revenues would be larger than American Express ($35.9 billion), Twenty-First Century Fox ($31.86 billion), 3M ($31.82 billion), Sears ($31.2 billion), Nike ($27.8 billion) and McDonald’s ($27.4 billion). On paper, the ColoradoCareYES campaign’s projected state tax and federal funding revenues add up to $38 billion. Our ruling The Colorado Health Institute analysis said the Colorado universal health care system would have a projected $38 billion in revenues, larger than major corporations. The numbers seem to add up if everything with ColoradoCare goes according to its supporters’ plans. The revenues would be larger than some big companies. However, the health care plan has a make-or-break need to obtain federal waivers that would allow it to assume the roles of state Medicaid and Affordable Care Act programs. No waivers means no deal. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aa4fc618-f92d-4df5-8f96-8cced5a8bbb1	None	Colorado Health Institute	None	None	None	2016-05-04T17:09:27	2016-04-08	['None']
pomt-09162	"Every major study that has been done by a legitimate group ... shows that there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created if you pass our (cap-and-trade) legislation. And if you wind up pricing carbon."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/08/john-kerry/sen-kerry-says-cap-and-trade-bill-would-create-job/	The latest version of cap-and-trade legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and encouraging a shift to more sustainable energy sources was unveiled by Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman on May 12, 2010. It's called the American Power Act. One of the biggest knocks on the bill from conservative opponents is that the bill would be a job killer. Sen. Kerry addressed that claim on ABC's ''This Week'' on June 6, 2010: "Every major study that has been done by a legitimate group ... shows that there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created if you pass our (cap-and-trade) legislation. And if you wind up pricing carbon." Kerry accurately cited the findings of the May 20, 2010, analysis of the American Power Act's job impact by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics. According to the report, "The American Power Act prompts $41.1 billion in annual electricity sector investment between 2011 and 2030, $22.5 billion more than under business as usual. Given that the United States is currently below full employment with most economists projecting a slow labor market recovery, this investment is more stimulative than inflationary in the first decade, resulting in an average annual increase in U.S. employment of 203,000 jobs above business as usual, with the net of the jobs lost in fossil fuel production and as a result of higher energy prices between 2001 and 2020. In the second decade of the program, higher energy and product prices offset the employment gains from new investment." But was Kerry right that every other major study done by a legitimate group came to the same conclusion that the bill would create hundreds of thousands of jobs? First of all, we couldn't find any other studies that specifically analyzed the employment impact of the American Power Act. It was only introduced less than a month ago. Several economic groups have studies underway, but the Peterson Institute appears to have reached the clubhouse first. But there are plenty of economic studies of generic cap-and-trade plans, as well as ones that specifically analyzed the version passed by the House last year. And some of their conclusions about job impact contradict the findings of the the Peterson Institute. In fact, on May 5, 2010, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report on how policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could affect employment. The CBO's analysis of research "concluded that total employment during the next few decades would be slightly lower than would be the case in the absence of such policies. In particular, job losses in the industries that shrink would lower employment more than job gains in other industries would increase employment, thereby raising the overall unemployment rate." CBO reached its conclusion based primarily on the review of three economic modeling studies, by analysts at Resources for the Future (RFF), the Brookings Institution and the consulting firm CRA International. The CBO "basically found that most of the studies found there's likely to be a small decrease in employment levels, relative to not doing anything, with the cap-and-trade policy," said Adele Morris, policy director of Climate and Energy Economics at the Brookings Institution. They aren't the only ones. Last year, for example, the Marshall Institute produced a report that found "estimates of job losses (due to cap-and-trade legislation) range from hundreds of thousands to millions." Said Morris: "It is certainly not the case that every major study done by a legitimate group found that there would be hundreds of thousands of jobs created. I would like to consider Brookings to be a legitimate group." The primary difference for the disparate findings, said Trevor Houser, who led the Peterson study, is that the Peterson study specifically evaluated the effect of the American Power Act, while the reports in the CBO did not. The Peterson report also assessed the bill given the real-time reality of a U.S. economy with unemployment near 10 percent and economists predicting a slow recovery. The reports cited by CBO are "full employment" models designed to assess the long-term impact (30 to 50 years), Houser said. Whitney Smith, press secretary for Kerry, also stressed that the three studies cited in the CBO report were not about Kerry's American Power Act specifically. And Smith cited a Peterson Institute response to the CBO study, which argues that the "methodological approach of the studies included in the CBO report arguably overstates potential job losses." So what other reports was Kerry referring to when he said "every major study that has been done by a legitimate group, most recently the Peterson Institute of Economics..."? According to Smith, Kerry was also referencing a report from Third Way, which describes itself as a "moderate think-tank of the progressive movement." The report concluded that job losses in "old industries" will be more than offset by an increase in clean energy jobs so that "that carbon pricing will result in net job growth" of somewhere between 118,000 to 1.1 million jobs. But the Third Way report isn't a study of the American Power Act either. It's a review of two dozen studies over the last three years of various plans to put a price on carbon. Third Way rejected reports from the ideological left and right and considered just those "in the middle." While the Third Way review did not specifically address the American Power Act, there is nothing in this latest cap-and-trade bill that would make it differ much with regard to the projections about the broad impact on the economy and the number of jobs gained, said Josh Freed, director of the Third Way Clean Energy Program. If Kerry is going to hang his hat on the fact that none of the other studies (such as those cited in the CBO report) looked at the American Power Act specifically, then we are really only talking about one study, the Peterson Institute study. We aren't aware of any others. Neither are the folks at the Peterson Institute. And the Third Way study cited by the Kerry spokesman isn't an analysis of the American Power Act either. So the question then is whether the American Power Act is so different from past versions of the cap-and-trade bill, or the generic versions modeled by various economists, that it would render their conclusions irrelevant in analyzing the American Power Act. And many economists we spoke to said that's not the case, that the earlier versions are substantially similar to Kerry's, especially for the purpose of analyzing the bills' jobs impact. And the fact that Kerry's spokesman included the Third Way study suggests they think it's fair game to consider older versions of cap-and-trade legislation for comparative purposes as well. Economists at the Peterson Institute, the Brookings Institution -- or for that matter at, say, the conservative Heritage Foundation, which projected a cap-and-trade bill could cost millions of jobs -- certainly disagree about each others' methodology. Various economic models employ different assumptions about everything from the viability of doubling the number of nuclear power plants to the prospects for the economy. They all look at different timelines. You may agree or disagree with the findings and methodology of the Peterson Institute study, but the fact is that other "legitimate groups" have performed studies and reached different conclusions. Kerry's statement suggests there is some unanimity of opinion among legitimate organizations about cap-and-trade's effect on jobs. And that's just not so. There is quite a bit of disagreement. So we rate Kerry's claim False.	None	John Kerry	None	None	None	2010-06-08T14:50:07	2010-06-06	['None']
pomt-12189	"In order to sell insurance in Florida there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. ... far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/jul/27/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-florida-mandates-coverage-more-co/	Republicans attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, have been met with concerns about whether health insurance will still offer comprehensive coverage under new rules. But U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says Florida law mandates that insurers cover more essential health benefits than the federal law. "In Florida, essential health benefits aren't just what the federal government requires, it is what state law requires," Rubio said on Facebook Live July 20. Then he continued "under state law, in order to sell insurance in Florida, there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. In essence, you cannot sell a health care plan in Florida if you don't cover these things -- far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare. Irrespective of what we do in federal law, we still have to follow the state law, and these plans will still have to go through the state. My point is much of what health insurance in Florida will look like will be determined by the state Legislature. That’s the way it should be." In Florida, are insurers required to cover more conditions than under President Barack Obama’s signature legislation? A reader emailed the Truth-O-Meter and asked us to check it out, so we did. Rubio has a point -- Florida did have a long list of health care mandates before the federal law passed in 2010. But multiple experts told us that comparing the number of state mandates to the number of essential health benefits in the federal law is not an apples-to-apples comparison. In some ways, the federal protections are more sweeping. Understanding what the laws say about coverage requires reading the fine print. Federal law requires coverage of 10 categories of essential health benefits Prior to the Affordable Care Act, every state had its own mandates. Some states had a longer list of mandates than others -- Florida’s list of mandates was long, said Timothy Jost, emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law and a supporter of the federal law. The Affordable Care Act took a different approach: It set 10 coverage "essential health benefit" categories for plans sold on the individual and small group markets nationwide. The categories were: Ambulatory patient services; Emergency services; Hospitalization; Maternity and newborn care; Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; Prescription drugs; Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; Laboratory services; Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and, Pediatric services, including oral and vision care. The federal law is a minimum standard -- states are allowed to provide greater benefits. For example, Florida law requires coverage of adult student dependents until age 30, with some caveats, while the federal law only requires such coverage until age 26. The 10 categories were intentionally broad so states could have flexibility to apply them. As part of the federal law, each state sets a benchmark plan which defines the essential health benefits. While the federal law sets 10 broad categories, Florida lists specific benefits. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation directed PolitiFact to the benchmark plan, a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan which shows about 34 covered benefits. The first thing we noticed is that the list of benefits has some overlap, so it doesn’t mean that the 34 benefits are three times more than the broader 10 required categories in the federal law. For example, in the federal law, mental health and substance use is one category, but in the Florida benchmark plan, that’s broken down into four benefits for inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance abuse. A spokesman for Rubio sent us a chart showing about 50 mandates and their accompanying state statutes. About half of the statutes related to health conditions or procedures such as newborn hearing screening, emergency room services and a mastectomy. The remainder were related to covering services by certain health providers, such as acupuncturists, or types of people covered such as dependent adult children. In the laws Rubio cited about providers, many don’t actually require that insurers cover certain services. For example, a statute Rubio cited about massage therapists states that if a policy covers massage, it must cover the services of a person licensed to practice massage if it has been prescribed by a physician. But the numbers alone don’t tell us much about the actual coverage patients receive -- we have to read the fine print to see who would get certain types of coverage under Florida’s laws, said Justin Giovannelli, an expert at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute. For example, Rubio’s list references laws on substance abuse and mental health treatment, but state laws don’t require coverage for those services for the individual market. However, since the federal law supersedes state law, the Obamacare plans must cover those services. Rubio also cited a Florida law about maternity care. That statute isn’t a blanket requirement that insurers cover maternity care. Instead, it contains a few provisions that explain if a policy provides maternity care, here are the particular requirements -- for example, it must cover post-delivery services. Once the federal law defined maternity care as an essential health benefit, then all individual plans had to include coverage for that benefit -- regardless of existing state laws. (Before the law, some consumers purchased riders.) "So whereas the ACA requires an insurer in the individual market in Florida to offer coverage that includes these benefits, if the ACA went away, an insurer would not be obligated by federal or state law to provide coverage of these benefits," Giovannelli said. Joe Antos, a health expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says it’s not surprising that Florida law lists more than 10 benefits. "The tradition among insurance commissioners in most states is to be more precise about what has to be covered," he said. But comparing the number of state benefits with the ACA’s required essential health benefits isn’t the point, he said. "The number really doesn’t matter. What matters is, what is the economic impact on the premiums?" he said. "When most people talk about this, they seem to think there are huge savings from cutting out things like maternity coverage and mental health. The reality is maternity coverage is very small percentage of the total for a comprehensive plan. Mental health would be expensive, but Medicaid picks up vast majority of mental health expenses." Rubio has a point about the state legislatures having the power to set health care laws -- something it had before the ACA and will continue to have. Richard Cauchi, a health insurance expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said that nearly half of Florida’s health care related laws were enacted before 1989 and only six in the last 10 years. The federal health care law has had a role in expanding the types of conditions covered in Florida. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, Florida Blue added pediatric services for dental, vision and habilitative services, said Doug Bartel, Florida Blue spokesman. Our ruling Rubio said, "In order to sell insurance in Florida there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. ... far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare." Rubio’s spokesman pointed to a list of about 50 state mandates, about half of which pertained to health conditions. But many of the state mandates only apply if an insurer chooses to cover a condition. The federal protections are more sweeping and put more requirements on insurers to cover a broad range of services. Rubio’s comparison omits that state laws alone would leave Floridians on the individual market without certain types of coverage that are mandated by the federal law. He also ignores that state categories are defined more narrowly. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03588	"We had people that were getting killed (in Benghazi), we had people who are willing to risk their lives to go save them, and somebody told them to stand down."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/14/jason-chaffetz/rep-jason-chaffetz-says-special-forces-ready-save-/	With Americans under attack in Benghazi, did the U.S. military do all it could to save lives? Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, says no. Four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, were killed in attacks that began Sept. 11, 2012, on U.S. compounds in Benghazi, Libya. Meanwhile, four special forces troops "willing to risk their lives to go save them" were "told to stand down," Chaffetz told Fox News host Sean Hannity. Did the U.S. fail to send life-saving help? Who knew what, when? Gregory Hicks was deputy chief of mission in Libya the night of the attacks, working from the capital, Tripoli, more than an hourlong flight away. He testified before lawmakers May 8, 2013, about a four-person team he had hoped would fly from Tripoli to Benghazi — but didn’t get permission to get on the plane. Chaffetz, the national security chairman for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, previewed Hicks’ testimony two days earlier for Fox News: Hannity: "Congressman Chaffetz, there was — we now have discovered through testimony, Greg Hicks among others — that there was a C-130 ready to bring reinforcements during the attack to help those that were under fire and they were ordered to stand down?" Chaffetz: "The administration including (Defense) Secretary (Leon) Panetta were very crystal clear, there were no military assets, but I got to tell you, we had proximity, we had capability, we had four individuals in Libya armed, ready to go, dressed about to get into the car to go in the airport to go help their fellow countrymen who were dying and being killed and under attack in Benghazi and they were told to stand down. "And Sean, of all the things I've seen, that's as sickening and depressing and disgusting as anything I have seen. That is not the American way. We had people that were getting killed, we had people who are willing to risk their lives to go save them and somebody told them to stand down." But Hicks’ testimony and a State Department review board report show it was clear the "people that were getting killed" were already dead when the security team was ready to go. Here’s the time line: Attackers streamed into the State Department’s temporary mission on Sept. 11 at around 9:45 p.m. The ambassador called Hicks to alert him to the attack. As Tripoli and Washington scrambled to respond, attackers set a diesel-fueled fire that killed Stevens and information officer Sean Smith. Around 11:30 p.m., the surviving Americans drove an armored vehicle to an "annex" — a CIA facility — a few miles away. They fought off attackers for about an hour and a half, and were able to "repulse them," Hicks said, by about 1:30 in the morning. Americans in Tripoli sent a seven-person security team to Benghazi, which landed around 1:15 a.m. Held up by lack of transportation and escort from Libyans, it got to the annex around 5 a.m. — just in time for a second attack. Mortar rounds rained, killing American security officers on the roof, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Hicks said there "was every reason to continue to believe that our personnel were in danger," so he wanted to send more help. "We determined that we needed to send a second team from Tripoli to secure the airport for the withdrawal of our personnel from Benghazi after the mortar attack," he said. The order of what happened next isn’t clear. In Tripoli, cars took Americans to meet a Libyan C-130 (a military transport plane) that would fly to collect evacuees in Benghazi. In Benghazi, Libyan militia members helped Americans evacuate around 6:30 a.m. to the airport, with a Defense Department drone watching overhead. A charter plane took a first group. The second group waited for the C-130. Here’s what Hicks told lawmakers: "The defense attache had persuaded the Libyans to fly their C-130 to Benghazi. ... Since we had consolidated at the annex, and the Libyan government had now provided us with external security around our facilities, we wanted to send further reinforcements to Benghazi. "We determined that Lieutenant Gibson and his team of special forces troops should go. The people in Benghazi had been fighting all night. They were tired. They were exhausted. We wanted to make sure the airport was secure for their withdrawal. As Col. Gibson and his three personnel were getting in the cars, he stopped. And he called them off and told me that he had not been authorized to go. The vehicles had to go because the flight needed to go to Tripoli, I mean, to Benghazi. Lt. Col. Gibson was furious. I had told him to go bring our people home. That's what he wanted to do. … So the plane went. I think it landed in Benghazi around 7:30." So the four men that Chaffetz talked about would have arrived more than two hours after the final deaths, after one group had already evacuated by charter plane. The C-130 landed back in Tripoli with the last evacuating Americans around 11:30 a.m. Chaffetz’s office says he never claimed that the "four individuals" would have saved lives — but that they were willing to go save people. "What is clear is that at the time they were told to stand down, it was not known whether they could/would have played a role in saving lives," said spokesperson MJ Henshaw. Panetta told senators in February that the Defense Department "employed every asset at our disposal that could have been used to help save lives of our American colleagues." During Hicks’ testimony last week, Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., read from a Defense Department press release explaining the security team was directed to stay in Tripoli because those in Benghazi "had shifted to evacuation." "We continue to believe that there was nothing this group could have done had they arrived in Benghazi, and they performed superbly in Tripoli," she read. "In fact, when the first aircraft arrived back in Tripoli, these four played a key role in receiving, treating and moving the wounded." Chaffetz’s spokesperson says it’s not clear exactly when the order was given that the special forces team stay in Tripoli, who gave it, or what was known about the safety of Americans in Benghazi when the order was given. "We have asked for exact times repeatedly, but haven’t received answers," she said. Our ruling Chaffetz told Fox News that "we had people that were getting killed, we had people who are willing to risk their lives to go save them and somebody told them to stand down." But it’s clear from Hicks’ testimony that four Americans "getting killed" in Benghazi were already dead when the decision was made to keep the special forces team in Tripoli. The mortar attack was over. A Defense Department drone watched overhead in Benghazi as Libyan militia members helped Americans get to the airport. Chaffetz, however, says the team was available to go save "people that were getting killed," calling the order to stand down "sickening and depressing and disgusting." His office clarifies he meant that the team might have prevented additional casualties if attacks had continued — an explanation utterly missing from his national TV appearance.

pomt-14416	Says Donald Trump "has said he wants to be neutral on Israel and the Palestinians"	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/mar/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-donald-trump-said-he-will-be-neutral/	The Republican candidates have competed to portray themselves as the top fan of Israel. During the GOP debate in Miami, Sen. Ted Cruz attacked Donald Trump for his stance on Israeli-Palestinian relations. "On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians," said Cruz. "As president, I will not be neutral." Trump defended his record on Israel, arguing that there is "nobody on this stage that is more pro-Israel than I am." Cruz has a point: Trump did say he wanted to be "neutral" in negotiations between Israel and Palestinians. However, that doesn’t capture the full spirit of Trump’s comments about Israel. Trump the negotiator Cruz was using an attack line we’ve seen before in an ad by Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Sen. Marco Rubio for president. Trump made the statement about being "neutral" at an MSNBC town hall in South Carolina on Feb. 17. (A Cruz spokeswoman on debate night sent us an article about Trump’s town hall comments.) MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough asked Trump whether Israelis or Palestinians were at fault for a lack of an agreement. So far, efforts have failed to work out a lasting comprehensive agreement on issues such as security, land claims, whether Israel can build settlements and recognizing each other’s right to exist. Trump refused to pick a side, saying that would hurt his ability to serve as a negotiator. "Let me be sort of a neutral guy .... I don't want to say whose fault is it," Trump said. "I don't think it helps." Trump made similar comments a couple of weeks later at a February debate in Houston. He said that when negotiating a deal, it wouldn’t help to pick a good guy and a bad guy: "It doesn't help if I start saying, 'I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage,' " Trump said, adding that he can’t negotiate as well if he takes sides. "With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel." During the debate at the University of Miami, Trump reeled off his pro-Israel credentials, including that he was a grand marshal for the Israeli Day Parade in New York. He stood by his words about his goal to remain neutral as a negotiation strategy. Trump said although he is "pro-Israel", in order to negotiate a peace settlement, "I would like to at least have the other side think I am at least somewhat neutral to them." Trump’s previous comments about Israel In December, Trump suggested to the Associated Press that to negotiate a deal, the big lift may have to come from Israel. "A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal, whether or not Israel's willing to sacrifice certain things," Trump said. "They may not be, and I understand that, and I'm okay with that. But then you're just not going to have a deal." Trump evaded specific questions about whether Palestinian demands are legitimate but said that Israeli housing projects were a "huge sticking point" in talks. The same week, Trump praised Israel by saying it had already "given a lot" in a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. But he said if elected, as a deal maker he wouldn’t want to give away his position ahead of time. "I’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room," he said. Trump also told the coalition that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2013. "I am a big fan of Israel," Trump said in the video endorsement. "And frankly a strong prime minister is a strong Israel." During the 2016 campaign, Trump had planned on meeting with Netanyahu in Israel but canceled after Netanyahu faced backlash after Trump’s comments about Muslims. When asked at the Republican Jewish Coalition if he had relationships with any Arab leaders, Trump said, "I haven’t been working too much with the Arab leaders." Spokespersons for Trump did not respond on debate night. Our ruling Cruz said Trump "has said he wants to be neutral on Israel and the Palestinians" Trump did make that statement during an MSNBC town hall in February. He has repeatedly said that in order to be an effective negotiator he believes he must approach the two sides with neutrality. But Cruz is omitting Trump’s comments and actions that have shown support for Israel, including that he endorsed Netanyahu. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-12633	Says if a Florida bill (HB 697) punishing sanctuary cities becomes law "it will be the only law of its kind in the nation."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/30/carlos-guillermo-smith/fact-check-florida-considering-one-kind-legislatio/	Florida House Republicans are following President Donald Trump’s lead by supporting legislation that requires jurisdictions to do away with practices that shield undocumented immigrants, which are known as "sanctuary cities." Rep. Larry Metz, R-Yalaha, sponsored a proposal (HB 697) that would require county and local law enforcement agencies to comply with and support enforcement of federal immigration law or face stiff penalties. The bill has moved along party lines in a couple of House committee hearings. It needs a full vote in the House and approval in the Senate, where it has not been heard at all, before it can reach Gov. Rick Scott’s desk and become law.. Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, has raised strong objections. Smith tried to weaken the bill with six filed amendments in a March 21 hearing. After all six of his attempts failed, Smith argued that the bill’s enforcement penalties are uniquely harsh. "It will be the only law of its kind in the nation," Smith said. This made us wonder: Is Florida considering one-of-a-kind legislation for sanctuary cities? It looks like Smith is basically right, if the law didn't undergo any significant changes and was signed by Scott. National experts agree that — to the best of their knowledge — while other states have taken up bills on sanctuary cities, no other law or pending bill goes as far in terms of the breadth of the prohibitions and the penalties imposed in HB 697. HB 697 offers an orginal mix of penalties There is no legal definition for sanctuary policies. The term is used to describe places that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The Trump administration has begun calling out cities and counties with these policies, and he promised to cancel all funding of sanctuary cities. Cities and counties that choose not to actively assist federal authorities in carrying out immigration enforcement duties argue that such practices negatively impact police-community relations, and that ultimately it's not their responsibility to enforce federal laws. Some argue that the tactics used to enforce these policies border on unconstitutional, too. The main way agencies refuse to comply is to not honor written requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain individuals for up to 48 hours longer than they would have been released. Metz’s bill doesn’t call out any specific places in Florida as sanctuary cities, but a staff analysis does mention a 2010 Miami-Dade policy as an example of place that might be affected by this bill. The county’s policy said that ICE detainers would only be honored if the federal government reimbursed the costs incurred. Miami-Dade mayor Carlos Giménez reversed the policy in January, putting him in the realm of compliance with Metz’s legislation. A major component of Metz’s HB 697 requires state and local entities, as well as law enforcement agencies to comply with the enforcement of federal immigration law 90 days after the law goes into effect. If they don’t? Cities and counties with those policies would face penalties that include: • a five-year suspension on receiving non-federal grant money from state and local entities that don’t honor immigration enforcement; • The threat of automatic suspension and removal from office for elected state officials accused of violating sanctuary prohibition policy; • A prohibition of public funds to reimburse or defend a public official who is accused of violating a sanctuary prohibition policy; and • civil fines if detainers are not honored starting Oct. 1. Smith said his research shows no other law in the United States goes that far. Smith found that Alabama, Georgia, Utah and North Carolina have laws that require entities to honor all ICE detainer and information requests, but still don’t go as far as HB 697. For example, Alabama law restricts funds, grants, or appropriations until a violation has ceased, but doesn’t have a provision to have a civil cause of action against an official if a person is injured by an undocumented immigrant. Georgia law authorizes local officials to cooperate with federal immigration officials, but doesn’t require it. Utah restricts sanctuary policies, but does not prescribe penalties. And North Carolina prohibits sanctuary cities, but there’s no enforcement mechanism. In addition, Indiana has a law that prohibited local governments from refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, but the penalties are lacking. It can be hard to say for certain if Smith is right, but national immigration experts agree with Smith’s point. "If passed, that statement is accurate in that no such law is currently on the books, although several state anti-sanctuary bills are pending with some similar provisions," said Avideh Moussavian, a policy attorney at the National Immigration Law Center. Smith’s research encompassed pending bills in other legislatures. While many states have pending legislation supporting compliance with ICE, he found, once again, that none of the penalties went as far as HB 697. Ann Morse, the director of the Immigrant Policy Project for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said her group is looking into 100 bills in more than 30 states related to local law enforcement and immigration. Morse said she couldn’t find any pending legislation with quite the penalties listed above. We also reached out to Monica Varsanyi, an associate professor at political science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY. Her research explores the explosion of state- and local-level "immigration" policy-making and she has authored several reports over the years regarding the topic. "I can say that I haven’t seen anything like this bill," Varsanyi said. "I can’t be 100 percent sure that there aren’t others out there, however." Three other immigration law experts from around the country gave a similar assessment. The only other state considering a bill anywhere close to Florida’s bill is Texas, which is considering a piece of legislation that would prohibit sanctuary city policies and apply some of the same penalties included in HB 697, including withholding grant money and civil fines. The penalties in Florida’s bill go further by restricting grant funds for up to five years. Texas’ bill only withholds funds for the following year. Metz told PolitiFact Florida he got the idea to withhold grant money from the Texas bill but considered its language too general. Because this is the second year Metz has proposed this type of legislation, he was able to survey bills from the 2016 and 2017 session to see what was out there before finalizing HB 697. "In some of the bills I surveyed, this year, they were looking at making it a criminal violation to have a sanctuary policy," Metz said. "I did not go that route. I felt it should remain in the civil arena, but with significant penalties." Our ruling Smith said that a proposed crackdown on Florida’s "sanctuary cities" HB 697 would be the "only one of its kind in the nation." Several states have come up with bills targeting so-called sanctuary cities. Among them, HB 697 in its current form is indeed unique in terms of the severity of the prohibitions and penalties against state and local entities that choose not to comply with federal immigration detainer requests. The Texas Legislature appears to have the next-closest version of this legislation. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-00777	"Wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the (NSA) database."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/09/edward-snowden/fact-checking-john-olivers-interview-edward-snowde/	Most Americans have a fuzzy understanding of exactly what the National Security Agency can and cannot see with its surveillance programs, much less what a former NSA contractor named Edward Snowden tried to do about it. That’s the finding, anyway, of informal street interviews by John Oliver’s crew at Last Week Tonight on HBO. Oliver devoted his April 5 show to the NSA spying story. It included an exclusive interview with Snowden, who is living in Russia after the State Department canceled his passport. And it included the topic of this fact-check: Can emails sent between two people living in the United States unwittingly end up on the computer screen of some NSA analyst? Oliver, who blends comedy with journalism, framed the discussion around the NSA peeping on nude pictures. Oliver asked Snowden to describe the capability of various NSA surveillance programs in relation to nude pictures sent by Americans, starting with "702 surveillance." This refers to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. This section was added in 2008 and was renewed under President Barack Obama in 2012. Could the NSA see a picture of, say, Oliver’s privates under this provision, he asked? "Yes," Snowden said, "the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which section 702 falls under, allows the bulk collection of internet communications that are one-end foreign." After an Oliver joke about "bulk collection," Snowden continued, "So if you have your email somewhere like Gmail, hosted on a server overseas or transferred overseas or anytime crosses outside the borders of the United States, your junk ends up in the database." Oliver jumped in and asked Snowden to clarify that the racy picture — if you’ve seen the interview, you know we’re paraphrasing — wouldn’t necessarily have to be sent to Germany in order to end up in NSA storage. "No," Snowden said. "Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database." Is it really true that this situation (regardless of the content of the email) could happen, and if so, is it likely? You’ve got mail … being collected by the NSA Several experts in national security law agreed Snowden’s scenario is plausible, thanks to holes in international surveillance laws that affect data shared between Americans living in America. The law that Oliver mentioned, Section 702 of FISA Amendments Act of 2008, is labeled "Procedures For Targeting Certain Persons Outside The United States Other Than United States Persons." Going on name alone, that sounds like the opposite of a license for the NSA to collect private messages between Americans. Not necessarily. The section addresses spying on communications on U.S. soil in which one end of the conversation is foreign. Critics, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Technology and Democracy, and American Civil Liberties Union, deem it a "backdoor search loophole" that allows the NSA to get access to information on U.S. citizens. The section says the government cannot "intentionally target" citizens of the United States with its surveillance, nor can it target a person outside the country to learn more about the communications of a person who is in the United States. "Intentionally," obviously, is a pretty big gap. NSA communications spying under Section 702 does not need an individual warrant. There are a few government spying programs that we know about, through Snowden’s leaks to journalists, that operate using Section 702, including Prism and Upstream. Prism, as outlined in a leaked slide, allows the NSA to collect via court order email, chats, videos, photos, stored data and files of foreign targets from technology companies such as Google, Apple, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook. Analysts reportedly use Prism in concert with Upstream, by which the NSA collects foreigners’ communications directly from the fiber-optic backbone of the Internet. A leaked NSA slide reported by the Washington Post describes Upstream as amassing "communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past." Through those spying programs, it is possible that American-to-American email could hit an overseas server and be pulled into NSA databases even though those emails are not the target of NSA searches. The law does not prohibit this kind of "incidental" collection of Americans’ communications, as long as it was part of an otherwise valid collection of non-Americans’ information, said Stephen Vladeck, American University national security law professor. Government reports, leaks and a scathing 2011 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinion offer more proof that the NSA cannot separate out communications between Americans from the emails involving a foreigner. "NSA’s knowing acquisition of tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications through its Upstream collection is a cause of concern for the court," wrote FISC Judge John D. Bates in the declassified opinion. It’s unknown exactly how often this happens, but it does not appear unusual. "It doesn’t matter whether it’s a d--- pic or a bland email," said Andrew Crocker, a senior analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which sued the NSA to release the Bates opinion. "These are all things that can be swept up." By law, the NSA is supposed to "minimize" wholly domestic communications it obtains, said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor who represented the United States on terrorism-related matters before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court while working for the Justice Department. This could mean deleting the email or not searching or using the information, something Snowden doesn’t say. "I can’t promise the email wouldn’t end up in an NSA database," she said, "but it’s not going to be accessible to the government if it does." Other experts pointed out that we don’t know for sure what happens to these exchanges when they are collected. Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity fellow at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society, said many important features of Upstream collection "haven’t leaked and remain classified," such as whether it involves bulk collection, massive-but-targeted collection or only individually targeted collection, he said. Email routes that cross international boundaries So, yes, it’s possible that an email between you and your wife or husband about the grocery list could wind up in the hands of the NSA. But to do so, the electronic footprint of that email needs to leave the confines of the United States. How likely is that to happen? Understanding how or why an email may hit an overseas server even if it’s sent to someone in the same area requires a basic knowledge of how the Internet works. But even then, it’s complicated. So we turned to technologists, who had different opinions. Predicting how an email travels to its destination once you hit "send" is not an exact science — and it can change from hour to hour. When a person sends an email, it goes through the Internet service provider to an email provider, is exchanged with another provider, and goes back to someone else’s Internet service provider. If the Internet provider is big, like Verizon, the most efficient, least congested path to route the bits of information might just be a cable that crosses a foreign country’s boundary. Chats, pictures and messages travel from senders to recipients through the Internet along fiber-optic cables, some underground and some undersea. These cables can send messages in milliseconds. "The way the network thinks about distance is very different from the way you think about distance in the real physical world," said Joseph Hall, Center for Democracy and Technology chief technologist. Hall mentioned an example using the concept of "trombone routing:" Two people could be on opposite sides of Denver, and the most efficient way to get bits of information to them may be through a cable that runs through Canada. Mayer, of Stanford University, suggested the odds are good that your message is stored domestically if you’re an American who is working within the continental United States and who is using Gmail. Mayer called Snowden’s example of an intimate picture shared between a couple in New York hitting a London server en route to its destination "hypothetically possible, but it’s unlikely." The route between providers would have to be unusual, and the connection would have to be unencrypted, he said. "There are enormous privacy implications from the one-end foreign rule, to be clear," Mayer said. "I just don’t think this is a very generalizable example." On the other hand, Hall said, "It’s not hard to see this happening at all," even though more providers are encrypting their networks in response to NSA practices. Even though Hall and Mayer have different estimations for how likely it is for a U.S. user’s communications to be transmitted over a national border at a given time, Hall agrees it’s more likely for an email to cross a border in places that don’t have a huge infrastructure. Because Snowden mentioned Google’s Gmail service as an example, we checked in with the company to figure out under which conditions this example could happen. The company has strengthened the encryption of its infrastructure as a way to dissuade the government from using "backdoor" methods of tapping its network data without its knowledge. Emails between Gmail accounts are encrypted as they go to Gmail servers, which essentially means they look like gibberish to outsiders, and as they move from Google’s data centers around the country and the world. Copies of emails could be stored in several places, including in data centers abroad, as a way to provide backups in case one center fails. If the NSA tried to collect emails between Google data centers, they may be able to pull the metadata of messages (the to and from) but not the content. If one side of the exchange is not a Gmail user, the message may not be encrypted and therefore may be more vulnerable. As for how often an email may end up in a foreign server, even if it’s between two American Gmail users, spokesman Aaron Stein said, "We aren't always able to predict how often that happens." The NSA press office did not return requests for comment. Our ruling Snowden said, "Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database." In Oliver’s context of a naked picture, the comment may be surprising. But to experts familiar with the laws governing surveillance practices and the NSA programs brought to light through his leaks, Snowden is correct that this could happen. But this isn’t the most likely scenario for most Americans emailing other Americans day-in, day-out. Moreover, the NSA is supposed to "minimize" domestic emails that get caught up in a broader sweep, either by deleting them or not searching or using the information. Snowden’s claim is accurate but misses that context. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Edward Snowden	None	None	None	2015-04-09T17:31:28	2015-04-05	['London', 'New_York_City']
