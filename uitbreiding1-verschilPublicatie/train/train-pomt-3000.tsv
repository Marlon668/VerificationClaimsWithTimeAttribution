pomt-12049	"No court has held (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) unconstitutional."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/11/eric-schneiderman/has-daca-been-ruled-unconstitutional/	New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is leading a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its decision to rescind a deferred deportation program, claiming the move is discriminatory and that the program itself has not been ruled unconstitutional. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Sept. 5 the end for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era program that protected from deportation immigrants who came to the United States as children and live here illegally. The lawsuit from Schneiderman and 15 other attorneys general contends the administration’s action discriminates against Mexican immigrants, who account for 78 percent of DACA recipients. Trump since his campaigning days "has flagrantly displayed an anti-Latino, particularly anti-Mexican discriminatory animus," Schneiderman said on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show. "This is a massively successful program. There is no good reason to shut it down. There's no legitimate reason to shut it down. No court has held it unconstitutional," Schneiderman said Sept. 6. We’ve heard lots of competing claims from lawmakers, pundits and others that walk the line between fact and opinion regarding the constitutionality of DACA. Schneiderman’s claim is clearly stated as a fact. We found that he is right: DACA’s constitutionality has not been determined by courts. DACA created by 2012 DHS memo DACA is based on a June 2012 memorandum issued by Janet Napolitano, then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Napolitano’s memo outlined prosecutorial discretion so that resources would be used to remove immigrants who met the department’s priorities and protect from deportation young immigrants who met specific criteria. Napolitano said immigration laws were "not designed to be blindly enforced" without considering individual cases and circumstances. "Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language. Indeed, many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways. Prosecutorial discretion, which is used in so many other areas, is especially justified here," Napolitano wrote. DACA is a policy, but it is not a law. It also does not grant legal immigration status to the approximately 800,000 people who were approved for the program. Many have argued that creating DACA through the executive brach, rather than through the legislative process is an overreach of executive power. No court ruling on constitutionality of DACA There’s debate among experts on whether DACA is constitutional or not, but there is agreement that a court ruling on the constitutionality of the program has not been issued. "There has been no court decision holding that DACA itself is unconstitutional," Anil Kalhan, an associate professor of law at Drexel University. A lawsuit to challenge the 2012 DACA was dismissed for lack of standing, and that decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Kalhan said. "So there was never any adjudication on the merits," he said. "To my knowledge, no court has ruled DACA 2012 as unconstitutional and the one to even reach the court was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds," concurred Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a law professor and director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Pennsylvania State University. Wadhia and more than 100 other immigration law professors and scholars wrote a letter to Trump providing legal analysis on the executive branch’s legal authority to implement DACA. Other experts from the University of California also told us courts have not stricken down DACA as unconstitutional. "It's a straightforward fact that no court has declared DACA unconstitutional and that the one appellate court that considered a related program declined to address the issue," said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for Schneiderman. Texas and 25 other states won a lawsuit against the Obama administration by having a federal district judge block the implementation of an expanded version of the 2012 DACA and of another deportation reprieve program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). An appeals court upheld the ruling, and in 2016 the Supreme Court ruled 4-4 on the case, leaving in place the lower court's ruling. But when those programs were temporarily enjoined by the district court in Texas, it was not on constitutional grounds, Kalhan said, "but rather based on a conclusion that Obama administration should have instituted the policy using notice and comment rule-making, rather than using the more informal guidance document that it issued." A final, binding precedent even on that basis was not set either, since it was only a preliminary injunction and the Supreme Court deadlocked, Kalhan said. "And even then, some aspects of DAPA and the DACA expansion may be different from DACA in relevant ways that bear on legality—it has never been fully established the two programs stand on identical legal footing," Kalhan said. Our ruling Schneiderman said, "No court has held (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) unconstitutional." While there is debate on the constitutionality of DACA, that has not been determined by courts. We rate Schneiderman’s statement True.

pomt-14407	Says the man who rushed the stage at him in Dayton, Ohio, "had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS" in his social media posts.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-links-campaign-event-proteste/	Despite evidence to the contrary, Donald Trump on Sunday morning repeated his charge that a man who rushed at him in Dayton, Ohio, had ISIS affiliations. The March 12 incident at a Trump rally at the Dayton airport involved Thomas DiMassimo, 22. According to police, DiMassimo jumped a barrier and rushed the stage where Trump was speaking. Secret Service agents tackled him and took him into custody. DiMassimo was charged with inducing panic and disorderly conduct and was released from Montgomery County Jail later the same day. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER On NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd noted that after the Dayton rally, Trump tweeted a video that purportedly showed DiMassimo posing with a gun against the backdrop of an ISIS flag, with Arabic-language music playing in the background. Trump’s tweet said, "USSS (U.S. Secret Service) did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail." The link to the video was appended to the tweet. On Meet the Press, Todd said, "That turned out to be a hoax. Did you go over the top there on that?" Trump responded, "No, no, no, no. He was, if you look on the Internet, if you look at clips…" Todd repeated, "It turned out to be a hoax. Somebody made that up, sir." Trump then said, "Well, I don't know what they made up. All I can do is play what's there. He was walking, dragging the American flag on the ground. Is that a correct statement? Was that a hoax, too? Was he dragging the flag on the ground?" After further back and forth, Trump said, "No, excuse me, you didn't see the clip. He was playing Arabic music, he was dragging the flag along the ground, and he had Internet chatter with ISIS and about ISIS. So I don't know if he was or not. But all we did was put out what he had on his Internet. … (He) had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS." When Todd repeated that the video appeared to be a hoax, Trump responded, "Okay, look, well, was it a hoax that he's dragging the flag? Was that him? It looked like the same man to me. He was dragging a flag along the ground and he was playing a certain type of music. And supposedly, there was chatter about ISIS. Now, I don't know. What do I know about it? All I know is what's on the Internet." We decided to take a closer look at whether DiMassimo "had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS" on his social media posts. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The online trail DiMassimo, who could not be reached for comment, has a long history of anti-racist activism, often with a confrontational bent. For instance, he was apparently filmed on Aug. 12, 2015, destroying a Confederate battle flag at a protest at Stone Mountain, Ga. As it turns out, there is a similar video to the one Trump tweeted that apparently involves DiMassimo -- but it doesn’t show anything related to ISIS. The video, uploaded by YouTube user "Tommy DiMassimo," shows a man who appears to be DiMassimo taking part in a protest at Wright State University, where he is reportedly a student, in April 2015. The video shows him dragging a United States flag behind him, and ultimately standing on it. Trump, in the Meet the Press interview, seems to be correct that genuine video exists of DiMassimo dragging the U.S. flag. And we expect that Trump won’t be the only American disturbed by such images. However, that’s not the same thing as DiMassimo being linked to ISIS. Trump’s tweet made the connection based on an edited version of the video DiMassimo originally uploaded. Unlike DiMassimo’s original uploaded video, the one Trump linked to includes an image of DiMassimo armed and in front of the ISIS flag, as well as Arabic-language music. (The post also fails to capitalize the first "M" in DiMassimo’s last name.) The version Trump linked to also includes Arabic text in the description, but according to BuzzFeed, "the Arabic is badly garbled, but appears to say ‘Tommy D’ was trying to look ‘cool’ and as if he has big balls for standing on an American flag." BuzzFeed tracked the video with the ISIS imagery to a May 2015 upload by someone named Thomas Jenners, whose account has since been deleted. It also found a Facebook page called "Tommy dimassimo wasn’t hugged enough as a kid" that was dedicated to trolling DiMassimo, including ISIS-related jabs. Here’s one: Put it all together, and all signs point to the video Trump tweeted being either a hoax or an effort to troll DiMassimo. When we contacted Andrew Kaczynski, BuzzFeed’s specialist in debunking Internet hoaxes, he said his conclusion is that "there's nothing linking him to ISIS." The law-enforcement angle Further supporting the hoax theory of the ISIS video is that the criminal justice system has not treated DiMassimo as an ISIS-linked or ISIS-inspired terrorist -- even though the high-profile incident and the involvement of the Secret Service would have made such a linkage, if it were real, an urgent issue of national security. The fact that DiMassimo was released within hours of the incident is something that would be almost inconceivable if he had truly been a terrorist linked to ISIS, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. "If the guy had actually made an ISIS video while doing his activism, then the feds would have certainly come across it," Gartenstein-Ross said. "And then there would be a number of things he could be charged with, such as material support for terrorism. There would certainly be an argument that he poses a threat to the community for his pro-ISIS ties, which means they could have detained him pending trial." The police report of the incident, obtained by the Dayton Daily News and shared with PolitiFact, says DiMassimo told police that he intended to take Trump’s microphone and yell, "Donald Trump is a racist." The report makes no mention of ISIS or Islamic terrorism. Our ruling Trump said Thomas DiMassimo, the man who rushed at him in Dayton, Ohio, "had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS" in his social media posts. There is lots to offend people on DiMassimo’s social media posts. But there doesn’t appear to be any legitimate connection between DiMassimo and ISIS. The link Trump tweeted was a hoax or an effort to troll DiMassimo. It’s also unlikely that someone who really had ISIS ties and who had been arrested for threatening a presidential candidate on live television would be quickly released from custody pending trial. The police report of his arrest makes no mention of ISIS or Islamic terrorism. We rate the claim False. UPDATE, March 14, 2016: In an interview with CNN on March 13, DiMassimo "vehemently denied belonging to ISIS. He told CNN the video was doctored and provided a link to what he said was the original footage from a protest he participated in more than a year ago."

pomt-08450	"Amendment 4 will reduce Florida’s economic output by $34 billion annually."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/15/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/study-claims-amendment-4-will-cause-34-billion-imp/	When Florida voters head to the polls on Nov. 2, 2010, aside from casting votes for public office, they’ll also have six state constitutional amendments to mull over. One of the proposals up for a vote, Amendment 4, aims to put land use changes before local voters, and has sparked heated debate. Supporters argue the measure will give more power to local residents by allowing them to make decisions regarding development plans in their communities. Currently, those decisions are handled by an elected or appointed board such as a county commission or a local planning board. Opponents argue Amendment 4 will stall existing projects and drive away prospective developers from investing money in Florida. One of those claims of stalled economic growth comes from the "No on 4!" website. The website, sponsored by opposing group Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, Inc., quotes a January 2010 study by the Washington Economics Group which states: "Amendment 4 will reduce Florida's economic output by $34 billion annually." In a state hurting for tax dollars, $34 billion is a large figure to toss around, so we decided to take a closer look at that claim. Aside from reaching out to the Washington Economics Group to determine how they arrived at the figure, we also received a counter-study by Hometown Democracy, the group backing Amendment 4. We also contacted economists at the University of Central Florida, Florida State University, University of Miami and the University of Florida. But before getting into all the numbers, data and theories, first a quick primer on Amendment 4. Amendment 4 was placed on the November ballot after Hometown Democracy was able to collect 676,811 petition signatures statewide, more than the state requirement to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. The proposal is summarized as follows on the election ballot: "Establishes that before a local government may adopt a new comprehensive land use plan, or amend a comprehensive land use plan, the proposed plan or amendment shall be subject to vote of the electors of the local government by referendum, following preparation by the local planning agency, consideration by the governing body and notice." Essentially the proposal would allow voters to decide on changes to local land use plans, rather than having the decision rest in the hands of city councils or an appointed local planning agency. So now that you're an expert on the 1-2-3's of Amendment 4, back to the study in question. Washington Economics Group Study The Washington Economics Group is a private consulting firm whose principal adviser is Tony Villamil. Villamil served as U.S. undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, under the George H.W. Bush administration, and is dean of St. Thomas University's School of Business in South Florida. "It impacts the ability to generate development, expand operations, the ability to attract new companies coming into the state if they're not part of prior growth plans," Villamil said in a phone interview regarding Amendment 4 and his study. The WEG study used computer software called IMPLAN to simulate two outcomes. A "modest outcome" where only 10 percent of new real estate developments would require a referendum to amend comprehensive growth plans, and what the researchers call the "most likely scenario," where 25 percent of new real estate expansion will require a referendum. It's under the 25 percent scenario that the WEG report contends that Florida will suffer from $34 billion less in economic output. The study argues that 125,616 jobs (or approximately 25 percent of the workforce in the development industry) are "directly endangered." Hometown Democracy Counter-Study Hometown Democracy, the group pushing for Amendment 4, commissioned its own study to refute the claims made in the WEG study. The group hired Braun & Soskin Economic Consulting, run by two University of Central Florida economists. While we took both studies with a grain of salt, we felt it was important to include the questions and concerns raised by the counter-study. Braun & Soskin contend that the WEG model did not reflect any "positive outcomes" in the study. "The WEG report admits that much of the adverse effect of the amendment 'will be on large scale commercial and residential developments….' " the counter-study notes. "These are the projects that contribute the most to sprawl, urban flight and blight in abandoned downtown areas. The benefits from halting sprawl and blight -- unlike the 'costs' from Amendment 4 are measurable: the saving from holding down crime, commuting times, and public service costs (and taxes to pay for them) to fund sprawling public transportation, EMT, policing, trash pickup and fire protection districts...If Amendment 4 saves Florida these costs, those benefits should be counted in any impact study." "WEG makes an untenable assumption that all referenda get rejected by voters," Braun & Soskin wrote. "WEG assumes that all construction jobs are for residential and commercial and none for institutional, industrial, transport infrastructure, extractive and other construction." What do the experts have to say? Since both studies come from groups with vested interests, we turned to economists at the University of Florida, University of Miami and University of Central Florida to help us make sense of all the numbers and theories. Dr. Christopher Cotton is a professor with UM’s School of Business, who specializes in political economics and experimental economics. Prior to becoming a professor, he worked as a consultant conducting economic impact studies. He has not written or advocated on Amendment 4 in this election. Cotton was critical of the WEG study, saying: "I see absolutely no reason to believe the findings of the Washington Economics Group report." He explained in an e-mail: "My biggest criticism is that the report ignores alternative uses of resources and potential benefits. Think about an investor who wants to build a new hotel, but due to Amendment 4 cannot get the rezoning he needs for the project. The report assumes that the investor does nothing with the money that he wanted to use to build the hotel. In reality, he may choose to remodel a run-down hotel instead, or complete another project where zoning is feasible. In reality, he does invest in something else, and this something else will also have economic benefit. This is ignored by the report." Dr. Sean Snaith is an economist with the University of Central Florida, and while Snaith penned an op-ed piece for the Sarasota Herald Tribune speaking against Amendment 4, he also expressed hesitation that specific numbers on the financial impact could be reached at this point. "I think you open up a can of worms," Snaith said in a phone interview. "There are still too many questions up in the air. How is this going to be carried out? In terms of legal battles what will be the time frame? How many more projects will go through? How many less? I don't think we know. You're asking how people are going to behave in terms of voting, and you can't assume that the majority of projects will be rejected. It might be the most environmentally egregious project, but the developers could spend the most money in marketing their project and win the vote. You just never know." Dr. David Denslow is a professor at the University of Florida and an economics researcher for the school's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. He too has voiced his opposition to Amendment 4. He said the WEG study is reasonable but far from a certainty. His point: "We don't know for sure how voters will react, how the legislature will react, how developers will react. Nor do we know for sure what Florida's growth path would be without Amendment 4, as a base. Adding to the uncertainty is the current truly unusual state of the housing market. Would Amendment 4 increase the demand for vacant houses because it'll be harder to build new ones? Or would it reduce the demand because people will think Florida will stop growing and not want to start new businesses?" As an aside, the state Financial Impact Estimating Conference also provides an evaluation of the financial impact of Amendment 4, as it does for all amendments. That evaluation looks not at the cost of lost (or gained) economic output, but at the cost to cities and counties to conduct special elections. Comprehensive plans can be amended just twice a year, and between 2001 and 2005, a statewide average of 7,878 amendments was proposed each year. The statement summarizes: "Assuming every Florida voter is impacted by a single special election, costs would range between $10 million and $20 million." If lower-cost mail-in ballots are used and special elections affected just 25 percent of the voters, the cost would still be more than $2.4 million, in the state's estimation. But in the end, the conference found the same uncertainty as the university economists: "Nevertheless, the amendment's impact on local government expenditures cannot be estimated precisely." Just another unknown cost we weighed in our consideration. Our ruling So back to the question. Will Amendment 4 reduce Florida's economic output by $34 billion annually? There are bound to be some economic impacts, but as all the economists noted, it would be premature to assume that anybody knows what that impact will be. Developers may decide not to push for projects under the new rules, if the amendment passes. Or they may propose other projects more likely to be approved. And voters may or may not approve the projects that do make the ballot. We steer clear of ruling on predictions, and that's the issue we have with the blanket statement made by "No on 4." The opponents use a scary number of $34 billion in lost economic output based on assumptions that other economists -- even two economists who also are opposed to Amendment 4 -- say aren't knowable. Everybody agrees the amendment would have some impact, but how much isn't known. Because "No on 4!" states the claim unequivocally without including the uncertainty, we rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04633	After hearing "the frustrations parents and teachers have with the FCAT," next year "we begin improving our testing system."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/14/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-phase-out-fcat-tv-ad/	Before Gov. Rick Scott hit the road on his education listening tour, he went to the airwaves to toss in his own two cents about Florida’s high-stakes testing system. Scott appeared in a TV commercial paid for by the Republican Party of Florida as the school year started, touting the GOP Legislature’s roughly $1 billion increase in education funding (a year after cutting more than that amount) and his own willingness to hear criticism. His message: He’s heard the concerns about the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, and change is on the way. "I've listened to the frustrations parents and teachers have with the FCAT," Scott said. "Next year we begin improving our testing system. No more teaching to the test. It's time we get a better measure of our children's progress." So is Scott taking action to improve testing and end teaching to the test? Actually, we found new education standards and assessments were in the works before he took office. Just about every state has agreed to adopt new education standards in language arts and math known as Common Core, a bipartisan product from the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers. Florida’s Board of Education adopted Common Core standards in summer 2010, as Scott fought through his Republican gubernatorial primary. These standards are not an effort to nationalize curriculum, though federal leaders like Education Secretary Arne Duncan like them because they are more rigorous and lend themselves to apples-to-apples comparisons for students across the states. Many states, including Florida, have received Race to the Top money for adopting these standards. To measure student comprehension of these standards, a consortium of 23 states and the Virgin Islands developed a new testing system for students from third grade through high school paid for by a $186 million Race to the Top grant. The new system is known as the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC for short. PARCC will gradually replace the FCAT, but that’s not Scott’s doing. Scott’s back-to-school message "was a little like the drum major who jumps in front of a parade that's already marching down Main Street," wrote Orlando Sentinel columnist Scott Maxwell in August. "It’s certainly not a reaction to parents that we’re doing this," said Mark Pudlow, a spokesman for the Florida Education Association. In the ad, Scott is vague about what changes are coming to Florida’s testing system next year. These new PARCC tests don’t fully kick in until spring 2015. What happens between then and now -- such as field-testing and piloting the new exams -- is purely transitional. Fifth and eighth graders will take a tougher version of the FCAT for science. Students will also be taking new end-of-course assessments in various subjects, including civics, U.S. history, algebra I, biology I and geometry. PARCC offers optional assessments to participating states, including a mid-year exam. While it’s possible more tests will be added over time, "it’s not likely that everything that is developed will be implemented in Florida," said Mary Jane Tappen, Florida Department of Education deputy chancellor for curriculum, instruction, and student services. Scott elaborates on the testing switch in a statement, saying he remains a "staunch advocate of student testing" and supports PARCC because the material "emphasizes analytical problem solving over memorization and simple recitation of facts." Indeed, the new tests will require students to show their work on math problems and defend their analyses of literary passages. So what has Scott done relating to the retooled assessments? Upon taking office, he recommitted Florida to these standards and "re-signed the PARCC Memorandum of Understanding," said Republican Party of Florida spokeswoman Kristen McDonald. She pointed to other examples of the state’s progression toward the new testing system under Scott, including the department training 8,000 education professionals over the summer and the state college system being the first in the country to work Common Core into its teacher-training curriculum. The new standards are already being worked in schools, Tappen said. As an aside, we wanted to address Scott’s "no more teaching to the test" rhetoric. It won’t be the last time you hear him say it, even though it’s actually been illegal for a while. Florida lawmakers made it against the law for teachers to stop regular class for FCAT prep in 2008. Still, given the stakes, some do. And starting teachers will have a portion of their pay tied to student performance in a couple of years, so the stakes are higher for them, too. A fear of teachers "teaching to the test" has not dissipated for some school advocates. Our ruling Scott’s commercial leaves viewers with the impression that changes are coming to Florida’s standardized testing system because of him. Really, Florida’s shift from FCAT toward PARCC and end-of-course exams was in the works long before he came on the political scene. Scott is affirming a movement started by Florida’s former Education Commissioner Eric Smith. We rate his claim Half True. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election.

pomt-09829	"President Obama . . . wants to mandate circumcision."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/27/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-circumcision-obama-cdc/	PARENTAL ADVISORY: We don't imagine there are a lot of kids reading PolitiFact, but this item contains explicit language you don't normally see here. Parental discretion is advised. A new rap song by the hip-hop artist Jay-Z takes a shot at Rush Limbaugh. But the radio talk show host — referring to the rapper as "Mr. Z" — said he was honored to be mentioned. "Does this, Snerdley, mark a new development in my career to be singled out in a rap song by the famous rapper Jay-Z?" he said to his call screener on his Aug. 25, 2009, show. "I guess it is. As far as I know I have never been mentioned in a rap song by anybody. I guess it means I've made it. I'm now in a rap tune by the famous rapper Jay-Z. (The song says) '[T]ell Bill O'Reilly to fall back. Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls.' I would remind the rapper Jay-Z: Mr. Z, it is President Obama who wants to mandate circumcision. We had that story yesterday; and that means if we need to save our penises from anybody, it's Obama. I did not know I was on anybody's balls, either. I'm happy to know that they think I am, though! But I didn't actually know that I was." It's an issue Limbaugh explored on his Aug. 24 show as well, saying, "Not that I'm against circumcision, but it's a family's decision. Leave our penises alone, too, Obama!" He cited a Fox News story about an upcoming report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that may recommend circumcision for newborn boys as a way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, because studies show that the procedure can reduce transmission of the disease from women to men. The CDC will be discussing what to include in the recommendations at the National HIV Prevention Conference, which is being held in Atlanta this week. The CDC is still mulling its decision, CDC spokesman Scott Bryan said in an e-mail. "It is important to note that the recommendations are still in development and the CDC has made no determination at this time about the final content," he wrote. "There is a deliberative process for our circumcision recommendations that allows for both external and internal CDC experts to weigh in, followed by a period of public comment after the draft recommendations are published. With respect to infant circumcision, it is important to recognize that many options are still being considered in this process, including simply educating parents about the potential benefits and risks in order to ensure they can make an informed decision." CDC is also considering whether to recommend circumcision for adult men who are at high risk for HIV infection, Bryan wrote. He emphasized that the recommendations "will be completely voluntary." We wondered whether Obama had been involved in the issue and specifically in the CDC's decision to write the guidance, as Limbaugh's claim indicates. We scoured his voting record on Congressional Quarterly , his position papers and speeches on Project Vote Smart , and even typed "circumcision" into the White House Web site , and came up with nothing. From what we found, Obama has not used the word "circumcision" in any public statement as a candidate or as president. We also found no evidence that he has recommended circumcusion to the CDC. The only link — and it's an indirect one — that we could find between Obama and the CDC's efforts was a press release on the White House Web site announcing a series of HIV/AIDS community discussions, the first one being held in conjunction with the National HIV Prevention Conference we mentioned earlier. But the release did not mention circumcision. It turns out that circumcision recommendations have been under discussion since 2007, when George W. Bush was president. Given the fact the CDC was pondering the idea back then, it is no more accurate to say Obama wants to mandate circumcision than to say Bush did. So, back to Limbaugh's claim. He says Obama "wants to mandate circumcision." But the CDC's eventual recommendations — if they even include circumcision — will be voluntary, not mandatory. In addition, we could we find no connection between Obama and the new guidance, and no evidence that Obama had even used the word in a public forum. In fact, the recommendations were under discussion long before Obama took office. This one is ridiculous enough to set the meter ablaze — Pants on Fire!

In an email, she said the governor started by looking at what it would cost the state to run the K-12 system during the 2013-15 biennium in the exact way its running currently -- this is also called current service level. Essentially, the same services that cost the state $5.715 billion this biennium are projected to cost the state $6.315 next biennium. Then the governor took a look at that extra $600 million; a big chunk of it, $265 million, came from the PERS increase. (As a side note, that steep increase stems from the 2007 stock market crash. Essentially, PERS is like any other investment portfolio; it rides the market up and down. However, when it’s on a downturn, there are still people expecting to get their pensions. In Oregon, that means the government has to go in and make up the losses.) We wanted to verify these numbers independently of the governor's office, so we called Paul Cleary, the executive director at PERS. Cleary told us that based on their estimates, the cost of PERS in education for the next biennium was predicted to rise by $400 million. The state isn’t responsible for that full amount, but rather 70 percent, or $280 million -- roughly the amount the governor had mentioned in his speech. The next step was to take the governor’s $265 million figure and divide it by the total number of students in the public K-12 system, which, by the Oregon Department of Education’s latest count, was about 560,000. Do that and you get about $475 per student -- or just about the $500 the governor mentioned in his speech. Now this isn’t a done deal, of course. If you take a look at the budget the governor recommended to legislators, spending on K-12 increases not by $600 million but by $400 million. The governor has a slighter increase -- and one that is largely the result of other personnel costs as well as a larger investment in education -- because he’s assuming PERS costs will be curbed by his plan to cap cost-of-living increases, among other changes. We note that the governor’s plan has to get through the Legislature, and if approved would likely face the hurdle of litigation. Becca Uherbelau, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Education Association, which represent public employees, says the proposed reforms would wind up in court. However, much of that has little to do with what the governor said -- and the statement we’re vetting. Kitzhaber has said on several occasions, most recently in his State of the State address, that if nothing changes, the state will be spending about $500 more per K-12 student to cover the cost of PERS in the next biennium. We checked his math and verified it with the executive director of PERS and the governor is right. We rate this claim True.	None	John Kitzhaber	None	None	None	2013-01-21T16:29:36	2013-01-14	['None']
pomt-10725	"John wasn't this raging populist four years ago" when he ran for president.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/19/barack-obama/edwards-tagged-populist-early-on/	After John Edwards charged that Barack Obama would be too willing to compromise with special interests, Obama jabbed back during an interview with the Washington Post on Nov. 8, 2007. "John wasn't this raging populist four years ago when he ran" for the previous Democratic nomination, Obama said. "He certainly wasn't when he ran for the U.S. Senate." Edwards has run for major office three times: He ran for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina in 1998, and he's run for president in 2004 and 2008. News reports from his 1998 race show Edwards was described as a populist early on, running as "the people's senator" and saying he would help fight powerful interests like the insurance lobby, just as he did in his career as a successful trial lawyer. Ferrel Guillory, a longtime Edwards watcher and director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed Edwards as a "suburban populist" back in 1998. In a 2007 interview with PolitiFact.com, Guillory recalled that first race. "The way Edwards framed himself was very much in tune with the modern suburban Southern middle class, who have anxieties about their medical care, about the quality of their children's education, and about their future," he said. If Obama didn't think of Edwards as a populist in 2004, a lot of other people seemed to. The Los Angeles Times wrote of Edwards, "The North Carolina senator lays his populist cards on the table in New Hampshire," while David Brooks wrote a column about Edwards titled, "The Happy Populist." Brooks, a conservative columnist, criticized Edwards' ideas as "false" and "too facile," but he painted a striking picture of classic populist rhetoric: "The emotional climax of his speech comes when he describes how he used to represent 'people like you' against teams of highly paid, distinguished corporate lawyers. 'And you know what happened? I beat them, and I beat them, and I beat them again!' The crowds go crazy..." Guillory said Edwards has struck populist themes his entire political life, but that's not to say Edwards hasn't sharpened his rhetoric and branched out to other populist issues over the years. During the course of the two presidential campaigns, Edwards has increased his support of unions, a crucial Democratic constituency, and spoken out more about international trade policy. "Edwards is in a different place than he was in 1998," Guillory said. "But it's not like he couldn't go back and give his speeches from 1998. He's just running for a different office in a different context." We give Obama a False ruling on his remark that Edwards came to populism recently. His Senate record may not be the most substantial, but Edwards has consistently raised issues of economic inequality his entire political career.

pomt-03721	Under Obamacare, Virginia taxpayers would have been "forced to pay for abortions" if the General Assembly had not recently intervened.	false	/virginia/statements/2013/apr/15/virginia-society-human-life/va-society-human-life-says-obamacare-allows-tax-fu/	The Virginia Society for Human Life was cheered by the General Assembly’s passage of a measure that will bar insurers who participate in a new federally run exchange in Virginia from covering most abortions. The action -- which was proposed by Gov. Bob McDonnell -- only allows exchange policies to cover abortions in cases when the mother’s life is in danger, or the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest. Shortly after the April 3 vote, the society issued a statement saying it was "extremely pleased that the members of the General Assembly have taken the important step to protect the taxpayers of Virginia from being forced to pay for abortions in insurance plans under the newly created federal health care exchanges." We wondered whether Virginia taxpayers really were on the verge of being "forced to pay for abortion," and were spared from that requirement by McDonnell’s amendment. So we took a look. The claim is centered on the requirements of Obamacare, which calls for statewide health insurance exchanges starting next year that will compete for the business of people who don’t have coverage through their employers. The idea is that it will allow individuals to get favorable rates paid by people in large group plans. Those who cannot afford insurance will get a federal subsidy to help them join an exchange. Virginia lawmakers originally had anticipated creating a state-run exchange, and in 2011 passed a bill banning most abortions from being covered in the program. But late last year, McDonnell announced Virginia would not create an exchange, a move that by default will leave the state with a federally run system. Lawmakers passed the amendment this year to guarantee that most abortions in Virginia would not be covered by the federal exchange. Did excluding abortion coverage spare taxpayers from having to pay for it? We asked Olivia Gans Turner, the president for the Virginia Society for Human Life, to explain her group’s claim. She pointed to a section of the Obamacare law that allows a state to prohibit any plan within its borders from covering abortions except in the cases when a woman’s life is in danger or instances of rape or incest -- limited circumstances that have long been covered under federal law. That provision makes it clear that "the only way for a state to not pay for abortions under insurance plans is to actually enact a law providing such a prohibition," Turner said. So Turner notes, as we have, that Obamacare gives states flexibility on whether to ban abortion coverage in exchanges. But whatever course states chose, there is no threat that public funds would be used for most abortions. That’s because Obamacare mandates a funding mechanism that will segregate premium payments for abortions from the federal subsidies some will receive to help cover the cost of care on the exchange. That system requires anyone who chooses to enroll in a plan covering abortion to make two payments. The first will go into an account for all non-abortion coverage in the plan. The second payment -- of at least $1 a month -- will go into a pool used only for abortion services, according to a July 9, 2012, report by the Congressional Research Service. Our ruling The Virginia Society for Human Life said a recently passed an amendment banning insurers participating in a state exchange from covering most abortions protected "the taxpayers of Virginia from being forced to pay for abortions." The statement ignores the fact that if abortion services had been allowed, insurers would have had to charge separate premium payments for such coverage and segregate the money from all other premiums. That ensures the payments for abortions would come out of policy holders’ pockets -- not public funds. We rate the claim False.

pomt-15301	"By declaring that Pluto was no longer a planet, the (International Astronomical Union) put into place a planetary definition that would have even declassified Earth as a planet if it existed as far from the sun as Pluto does."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/21/other-space/plutos-advocates-say-even-earth-would-not-count-pl/	The world’s best-ever glimpse of Pluto from the New Horizons spacecraft is giving the "Pluto question" new life: Should the icy orb be once again considered the ninth planet of our solar system? Images of the dwarf planet inspired a tide of Internet reaction last week, including memes, a funny interview between Pluto loyalist Stephen Colbert and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and a petition signed by more than 4,100 people to bring Pluto back to full planet status. The petition on Change.org, which was started by the producers of the Yahoo! web series Other Space, wants world astronomers to reconsider their 2006 decision to classify Pluto as a dwarf planet in its August assembly in Honolulu. "Not long after New Horizons was launched in 2006, the International Astronomical Union stripped Pluto of its planethood because it was different than the other eight planets that we committed to memory," the petition reads. "By declaring that Pluto was no longer a planet, the IAU put into place a planetary definition that would have even declassified Earth as a planet if it existed as far from the Sun as Pluto does." As crazy as it sounds, we wondered if the theoretical argument in the petition could really be accurate: Could Earth really be a dwarf planet in an alternate universe? (Assuming, of course, that Earth could form so far from the sun, which is not realistic.) The International Astronomical Union’s decision Ahead of Pluto’s demotion almost a decade ago, astronomers had been wrestling over what to do with the icy, diminutive planet as other bodies in the Kuiper Belt and elsewhere came to focus, including an even bigger world called Xena (renamed Eris). Should those bodies also be planets, or are they, like Pluto, something else? In 2006, the IAU came up with a resolution on how a planet ought to be defined. The IAU definition says a planet is a celestial body that meets the following criteria: is in orbit around the sun, has a spherical or nearly round shape, has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto passed the first two criteria, but it flunked the third about clearing the neighborhood around its orbit. We wondered if Earth would also fail to clear its neighborhood if it switched places with Pluto. And what in the heck does "clearing the neighborhood" mean anyway? Experts told us to think of it like a planet taking a broom to its orbit. " ‘Clearing the neighborhood’ is like sweeping up and tossing out an accumulation of debris once and for all, where no outside source replaces it," said Steven Soter, a resident research associate at the American Museum of Natural History, who also proposed a method of measuring the cleanliness of a planet’s orbit. However, Soter says the IAU definition is misleading because no planet can ever entirely clear its neighborhood, as asteroids and comets often leak back into orbital zones from the outside, he said. "The Earth even in its present location has not entirely ‘cleared’ its orbital zone," Soter said. "Asteroids and comets clobber it every few million years." Soter would rewrite the definition to say that a body must "dynamically dominate" its orbital zone in order to be considered a planet. This loosened definition means a planet could keep its neighborhood relatively clear in spite of constant debris coming in from the outside. Still, Pluto would not pass the planet test even under this term, Soter said. Pluto only dominates its own satellite system, and it has no influence on the rest of the Kuiper Belt that can be seen. If Earth were in Pluto’s position, Soter said it would still be a planet — but only marginally — based on its neighborhood-clearing abilities. Soter pointed to this wonky-looking graph to explain his point. The horizontal axis shows how far a planet is from the sun, while the vertical axis shows a planet’s mass relative to Earth. Every diagonal line on the graph shows how good a planet is at keeping its neighborhood relatively clear despite debris floating back in. Some planets (the larger ones at the top, such as Jupiter and Saturn) clear out more debris, and others (Mercury, Mars, the ones straddling the topmost diagonal line) clear out less. The farther a planet gets from the sun, the harder it is to keep its neighborhood clean. Right now, Earth does pretty well for itself. But move our planet right from 1 AU to 40 AU (Pluto’s location), and Earth is not as good as clearing its neighborhood. Again, hypothetically speaking. "The Earth in Pluto's orbit would have about the same dynamical power as Mercury or Mars, so it would (only) marginally dominate its new orbital zone," Soter said. So, Earth would still be a planet, but it would be close, he said. There is also another way of looking at this definition. Soter proposed a way of defining planets by looking at how significant a planet-like body is compared to other space debris in its zone. (Think of comparing the mass of the broom you’re using to the mass of garbage still left behind.) Would Earth still be a significant object when compared to everything else in Pluto’s neighborhood? Maybe. There is no way to predict and compare masses, he said. Arguments that support the petition The equation behind the graph was proposed by planetary scientists Harold Levison and Alan Stern, who is the lead investigator for the New Horizons mission to Pluto. Stern’s advocacy for Pluto being a planet is well-known, and he stressed in a phone interview that he has a very different take on this question than Soter. As he has said for years, Stern thinks Earth would not be able to clear Pluto’s zone and therefore not be a planet under the IAU parameters. The farther a planet (or planet-like body) is from the sun, the larger an object has to be to clear its orbital zone — which means Pluto, 4.67 billion miles from the sun, has it pretty rough out there. "The Kuiper Belt zone (the zone Pluto has to clear) is bigger than the zones from Mercury to Neptune," Stern told PunditFact. Mark V. Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., agrees with Stern that Earth would no longer be considered a planet if it were in Pluto’s location. Sykes went even further to suggest that Earth would no longer be a planet if it were placed between Jupiter and Saturn. "The IAU definition is analogous to putting an apple in the middle of the table, then moving it to the edge of the table and declaring it is no longer an apple," he said. Both Stern and Soter faulted a time crunch at the 2006 meeting that resulted in a rushed set of criteria for planethood. When the IAU proposed its new definition, Stern said, it was done "overnight" and no specific calculations were used. One of the concerns among scientists there was that if Pluto were admitted as a planet, then so would other space bodies. Some attendees worried there would be "too many planets to memorize," Stern said. The concerns were "not scientific … (but) somewhere between personal preference and political," Stern wrote in the Space article. There are also other concerns about the IAU’s decision. Only about 16-25 percent of the registered astronomers at the IAU meeting voted on the definition. Other scientists have also pointed out that the IAU’s definition is limited to our solar system and does not consider planets that might exist outside the solar system. We reached out to a representative from IAU to comment but did not hear back. Our ruling Other Space's petition claims, "By declaring that Pluto was no longer a planet, the (International Astronomical Union) put into place a planetary definition that would have even declassified Earth as a planet if it existed as far from the sun as Pluto does." Putting aside the fact that this could not actually happen, we heard very different opinions from scientists on whether the definition would really exclude Earth if it were in Pluto’s shoes. Pluto was demoted as a planet because it could not clear its orbital zone, a requirement established by the astronomers union. However, the IAU definition is ambiguous because no planet can ever completely clear its orbital zone. Absent a clearer definition, scientists disagree about whether Earth would be declassified in this far-fetched scenario, though it certainly would not do as good a job at "clearing the neighborhood" as it does now. The claim on the petition is partially accurate but leaves out important details — the main one being that we’ll never know for sure. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06447	"Nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/21/edith-ajello/ri-rep-edith-ajello-says-half-pregnancies-us-are-u/	In a recent Providence Journal commentary, Rhode Island Rep. Edith H. Ajello and Sen. Rhoda A. Perry argued for the need for better preventive medicine, including "the full range of reproductive health care." Until this year, health insurers could limit or even deny coverage to pregnant women if the insurer determined the pregnancy amounted to a so-called preexisting health condition. But that changed in March with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration’s overhaul of the health-care system. And in August, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services adopted guidelines for women’s preventative preventive care that include coverage for contraception. "It’s about time!" the legislators wrote of that measure. "Nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended." Nearly half? That caught our attention, so we decided to check it. First, some background. In their commentary piece, they urged Rhode Island to support the creation of a health-insurance exchange, as all states are required to do under the Affordable Care Act. The exchanges are intended to lower insurance costs by fostering competition among insurance providers. In Rhode Island, legislation to create an exchange passed the Senate but died in a House committee. Perry cast one of six dissenting votes against the Senate bill, which had been amended to include a provision to prevent health insurers from using taxpayer money or subsidies to cover abortions. ( A House bill with no restrictions on abortion coverage was held for further study.) Governor Lincoln Chafee issued an executive order in September to create an exchange. Under the new federal rules, insurers will have to expand coverage for preventive care, including birth control. The expanded coverage is clearly a significant development if, as Ajello and Perry wrote, "nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended." So we asked the two lawmakers for their source in writing the piece. The facts Ajello directed us to The Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization based in New York City, which does research and policy analysis about sexual and reproductive health. The Guttmacher Institute has produced two studies about unintended pregnancies in the United States. The most recent, "Unintended pregnancy in the United States: incidence and disparities, 2006’’ published in August 2011, states that "nearly half (49%) of pregnancies were unintended in 2006." The earlier study, "Disparities in Rates of Unintended Pregnancy In the United States, 1994 and 2001,’’ also reported 49 percent of pregnancies in 2001 were unintended, a level unchanged from 1994. The studies define an unintended pregnancy as one in which the pregnancy was either "mistimed," meaning the woman did not want the pregnancy at the time of conception (even if she may have wanted to become pregnant at some future date), or which was "unwanted," meaning that she did not want to become pregnant then or in the future. (Unintended pregnancies are an important public health issue, the study says, because they are associated with "a number of adverse maternal behaviors and child health outcomes, including inadequate or delayed initiation of prenatal care, smoking and drinking during pregnancy, premature birth and lack of breastfeeding, as well as negative physical and mental health effects on children.") Of the 6.7 million pregnancies in the United States in 2006, about 3.2 million were unintended, the 2006 study reported. Of the 3.2 million, the study said, 29 percent were "mistimed," and 19 percent -- or 608,000 -- were "unwanted." The original study, as well as a footnote referencing the more recent one, were posted on the web site of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A CDC spokeswoman confirmed that the Guttmacher studies are based on data from the CDC’s National Survey of Family Growth, an ongoing survey of about 5,000 women each year whose responses are compiled in periodic reports that reflect the reproductive history of tens of thousands of women. The studies also rely on population data from the U.S. census. Both studies reported that the share of total pregnancies that were "unintended" has remained unchanged at 49 percent. Our ruling Perry and Ajello stated that nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Two studies based on data from the U.S. census and the CDC reported that the share of unintended pregnancies in the United States was 49 percent. We rule this claim True.

pomt-11155	"Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/may/25/sydney-batch/nc-democrat-said-nc-budget-had-passed-it-hadnt/	Democrats are mad that Republicans plan to change state government spending without their direct input. Republicans, who hold a supermajority in the North Carolina Legislature, are mostly negotiating budget changes amongst themselves and intend to block any proposed amendments to their bill. But, if voters were to read one Democrat’s newsletter, they’d get an entirely different picture of the situation. A May 23 newsletter distributed by Sydney Batch, a Democratic candidate for NC House, overstates what has happened so far. "Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget," the newsletter said. It adds: "For the first time in (the) history of our great state, they are not allowing any debate or input on our budget." Batch is running for a House seat representing Raleigh’s southern suburbs. That district's incumbent, a Republican, isn't running for re-election so Batch will face Republican candidate John Adcock. The problem with Batch’s statements is that they aren’t accurate. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com As we write this fact-check, legislative Republicans have yet to vote on or even reveal their full budget plans. And her statement about the lack of debate is also misleading. Republican leaders plan to gut an old bill and amend it as a "conference report" to include their budget plans, meaning state lawmakers will have no method for amending the legislation. But it remains to be seen whether Republicans will allow debate on the floor of the House and Senate chambers. As for the historical precedent of blocking amendments, The News & Observer story, which Batch linked to in her newsletter, says amendments won’t be allowed for the first time in "modern history." Gerry Cohen, former head of the bill-drafting division in the Legislature, told the Associated Press that legislators haven’t completely skipped the amendment process since at least the early 1970s. When contacted by PolitiFact, Batch referred to the claim as "an inadvertent typo." An apology "I meant to type, ‘Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly decided that they are going to use the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget,’" Batch wrote in an email (Whether or not the process Republicans are using can be referred to as "the nuclear option" is another debate altogether.) "I will retract and edit the statement with the email list shortly. Thanks for bringing it to my attention," Batch wrote. And retract the statement, she did. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com On May 24, Batch distributed a newsletter apologizing for her mistake. "Friends and supporters, yesterday, there was an error in oversight," she wrote. In using a conference report, "the leadership does not have to allow debate or input on the bill. This enables leadership to stop any changes to their bill, that has become NC's budget. This bill is expected to pass immediately in both chambers when properly introduced. It is a secretive and unethical way to govern," she said, concluding: "I apologize for the mistake in the language used in yesterday's title and if you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact the campaign." Our ruling Batch said, "Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget." In fact, the budget hasn’t been approved yet. It hasn’t even been put up for a vote. Batch apologized for the mistake and retracted her statement in a new email – which PolitiFact applauds. But that doesn’t protect her first statement from our Truth-O-Meter. We rate her claim False. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misquoted Gerry Cohen, former had of the bill-drafting division in the legislature, saying that a state budget had previously been approved without going through the amendment process. To clarify, Cohen isn’t sure whether it has happened before. This error doesn’t affect PolitiFact’s rating.

pomt-03292	"Even the employees’ union for the IRS -- the very people in charge of enforcing this law -- are begging to be let out from under this law."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/01/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-union-irs-workers-begging-be-let-/	During a recent interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., picked up a talking point that had been widely repeated in the conservative blogosphere about workers at the Internal Revenue Service wanting to get out of Obamacare. Referring to President Barack Obama’s health care law, Rubio said, "Even the employees’ union for the IRS -- the very people in charge of enforcing this law -- are begging to be let out from under this law." Since federal-employee unions tend to be some of Obama’s staunchest supporters, it would be unusual if the National Treasury Employees Union had turned against the president over his signature legislative accomplishment. Is that really what happened? There’s a kernel of truth here, but the episode is considerably more nuanced than Rubio, or most of the other commentators, let on. The union wasn’t lobbying against Obamacare per se, but rather against a bill sponsored by one of the law’s opponents that would change how Obamacare operates. (You can read the union’s form letter here.) This is a complicated tale, so we’ll start at the beginning. When the health care law was being written in 2009 and 2010, Republicans proposed requiring lawmakers and their staffers to obtain insurance through the exchanges, arguing that if the law was good enough for ordinary Americans, then it was good enough for the people in Congress who wrote the law. Presumably fearing a public backlash if they refused, Democrats accepted the language, and it became part of the law. But as the New York Times recently put it, the provision "has been a headache for many in Congress ever since." That’s because the law does not include an explicit mechanism to allow the federal government to pay its employer share of congressional employees’ health insurance if they use the exchanges. For most Americans with employer-based insurance, including government employees, the employer pays a majority of the cost of insurance, lessening the financial burden for employees. Unless a fix can be found, congressional employees will have to foot the entire cost of their health insurance when buying insurance on the exchange -- a financial hit that could go well into the thousands of dollars. Despite longstanding concerns about the provision’s impact, neither Congress nor the administration has yet come up with a workable solution, although the administration promises action in time for the opening of the exchanges this fall. However, after word leaked to Politico in April that congressional leaders in both parties were "engaged in high-level, confidential talks" to rescind the provision, U.S. Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., decided to offer a bill that would expand the mandate to use the exchanges beyond Congress to the president, vice president and all federal employees. As of this writing, the bill had not advanced to a committee hearing. Still, the fact that the bill was introduced at all set off alarm bells at the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 employees in 31 federal agencies and departments. That includes the IRS, which has a role in enforcing the tax penalties for failing to secure health coverage. This is why the union has urged its members to oppose Camp’s bill. In a statement to PolitiFact, union president Colleen M. Kelley called Rubio’s claim "a misrepresentation." She said the union’s beef is not with Obamacare itself, and the episode does not represent a policy rift between the union and Obama. Rather, the union is concerned that an opponent of Obamacare wants to change the law, effectively uprooting 150,000 of its members from their existing plans and potentially leaving them to pay the entire cost of their health insurance without employer assistance. When we checked with health policy experts, most said they don’t blame Rubio for seizing on a juicy dispute among longtime allies, but they agreed that the actual story is a lot more complicated. Obama and his allies created a system in which most Americans -- at least three quarters -- who had insurance would remain on their existing plans and would see few if any disruptions from the new law. The exchanges were created to provide a marketplace for Americans who lack insurance entirely or have to buy insurance on their own. By contrast, Camp’s bill would force federal employees out of their longstanding coverage and into a new system. An added irony is that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is widely considered a key model for the exchanges themselves. Under the program, federal employees under the age of 65 can choose among a variety of health insurance offerings, just as people will be able to do under the exchanges. In 2003, the conservative Heritage Foundation published a paper touting the program as a model for market-based health care reform. "The union is correct that the primary purpose of the ACA is to provide a marketplace for the sale of health insurance for those who do not have such coverage, which would of course exclude IRS and other government employees," said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. In fact, she said, "Federal employees, unlike most other employees, have been offered a wide variety of plans through the FEHBP program and are probably the least likely to want to leave their present" coverage. Our ruling Rubio said that "even the employees’ union for the IRS -- the very people in charge of enforcing this law -- are begging to be let out from under this law." He has a point that the National Treasury Employees Union has asked its members to oppose efforts to force its members into the exchanges created by Obama’s health care law. But he ignores a lot of context that would give a listener a different impression. The union’s quarrel is not with Obamacare itself, but rather with efforts by the law’s opponents to uproot federal employees from their longstanding health plans, a change the union views as punitive.

pomt-03242	I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven't won one against a white person.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/15/kanye-west/west-hits-sour-notes-grammy-claim/	PolitiFact Georgia typically limits its fact-checking to politicos and power brokers who make an impact on the political process. But sometimes the worlds of politics and entertainment intersect. Such is the case for rapper-producer Kanye West, who just happens to have metro Atlanta connections. West is one of the most recognizable and best-selling musicians around. But he has also had his share of run-ins with the top rungs of the political class, including Republican and Democratic presidents. He evoked the ire of President George W. Bush in 2005 by telling the country during a televised benefit concert in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina that "George Bush doesn’t care about black people." Bush later said that the suggestion was an "all-time low" of his presidency. President Barack Obama called West a derogatory term after the rapper infamously interrupted singer Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech at the 2009 Video Music Awards. The president slammed West again in a follow-up interview. Just a couple of weeks ago, Obama criticized the over-the-top lifestyle of West and the entertainer’s unmarried mother of his child, Kim Kardashian. Obama questioned the effect the West-Kardashian lifestyle would have on impressionable young people who view them as role models. So we decided to check West’s statement about his place in popular culture. (Visit our Facebook page and let us know what you think: www.facebook.com/politifact.georgia.) About a week before the release of his album "Yeezus," The New York Times published an extensive interview with the Chicago rapper. During that interview while discussing his Grammy wins, West said, "I don’t know if this is statistically right, but I’m assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven’t won one against a white person." He continued: "But the thing is, I don’t care about the Grammys; I just would like for the statistics to be more accurate." West’s claims about having the most golden gramophones piqued our interest, so we decided to run them through the AJC Truth-O-Meter. West is a hometown boy. Although he claims Chicago as his home, the rapper was born in Atlanta before moving with his mother to the Windy City at age 3. His parents met and married in Atlanta, according to a book by West’s mother. His father, Ray West, was one of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s earliest black photographers. The AJC recently compiled a slideshow of some of his photographs taken while working at the paper. To check out Kanye West’s claims, we first contacted his publicist, Gabe Tesoriero at Island Def Jam Music Group. Tesoriero asked what our story was about. We detailed the claims we were checking and the PolitiFact process. Tesoriero provided no further response. The official Grammys website says the honors are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and recognize achievement in the music industry during the previous year. The first Grammy Awards were held in May 1959. Slate Magazine also checked out West’s claims. The online magazine found that he was partially accurate. At age 36 and with 21 Grammy wins (out of 53 nominations), West has the most awards for anyone his age, Slate said. But he has beaten out several white artists for the awards, including fellow rappers Eminem and the Beastie Boys. We reviewed a list of Grammy statistics compiled by Wikipedia. Doing our own research, we counted each Grammy for artists ahead of West on the list of Grammy wins. We checked the artists’ biographies to determine their 36th birthday to compare their wins by that age. West’s 21 wins ties him with composer and pianist John Williams for the eighth most Grammy wins. Our research found that singer-songwriter Alison Krauss (with 27 Grammys) appears to have tied West’s 21 wins by age 36, according to official past winner information and biographical data we checked. (As a group, rock band U2 earned its 22 awards before 2012, when the band would have been together 36 years.) But other award winners with more Grammys ahead of West on the list -- including Quincy Jones and Stevie Wonder -- had not reached the 21-award mark by their 36th birthdays. The King of Pop, Michael Jackson, by the way, earned 12 Grammys by his 36th birthday. As to whether West has ever beaten out any white artists, he has. For example, in 2005, West beat nominees including Eminem for best rap solo performance with "Gold Digger." But all of West’s Grammy wins have been in the rap and R&B categories, which are dominated by black artists. He has never won overall Grammys in categories such as Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Multiple music critics have criticized the Grammys for overlooking West in these broad categories. Writers for Time and the Los Angeles Times cried foul when West’s "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" wasn’t nominated for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammys. The Slate Magazine writer who also examined West’s Grammy claims noted that "West believes that he has been shut out from the ‘bigger’ awards ... in part because he’s black." West’s opinions about his Grammy standings are his own and not for Politifact Georgia to check. But on the facts, West claimed he has won the most Grammys for anyone his age. One other individual artist, Alison Krauss, has tied this feat. On his claim that he’s never beaten out a white artist for a Grammy, West is incorrect. He has beaten white artists in album and song categories. We rate his claims Mostly False.	None	Kanye West	None	None	None	2013-08-15T10:00:15	2013-06-11	['None']
pomt-12735	"I’ve been on the Armed Services (Committee) for 10 years. No call or meeting w/ Russian ambassador. Ever."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/02/claire-mccaskill/claire-mccaskill-says-she-never-met-russian-ambass/	Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign over taking meetings with the Russian ambassador without disclosing it to Congress. Sessions, a former Republican senator from Alabama, defended the one-on-one he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak because it was part of his duties as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a surrogate for President Donald Trump’s campaign. In a retort, McCaskill, also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she never met with Kislyak, who has held his position since 2008. "I’ve been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years. No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of Foreign (Relations Committee)," she tweeted March 2. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But McCaskill’s own earlier tweets show that that’s not the case. She has communicated with the Russian ambassador, at least twice, to discuss policy matters. "Off to meeting w/Russian Ambassador. Upset about the arbitrary/cruel decision to end all US adoptions, even those in process," she tweeted on Jan. 30, 2013. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The Atlantic has a picture of that very meeting, showing McCaskill (and a few other senators) sitting across the table from Kislyak. And in April 2015, she tweeted: "Today calls with British, Russian, and German Ambassadors re: Iran deal. #doingmyhomework." McCaskill spokeswoman Sarah Feldman said McCaskill’s interactions with Kislyak were materially different than Sessions’. Sessions met with Kislyak one-on-one around the same time Russian actors are believed to have been meddling in the election. McCaskill, on the other hand, met him in a group setting to discuss adoption policy and in a brief phone call about the Iran nuclear deal, Feldman said. A few hours after tweeting that she never met with the Russian ambassador, McCaskill published two clarifications, downplaying the significance of the two interactions she had with Kislyak. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com She also told CNN that Twitter’s 140-character limit prevented her from initially saying she never received a call from the ambassador, as opposed to the call she made to the ambassador about the Iran deal. Sessions had two interactions with Kislyak in 2016. The first was in an informal group setting at a July 2016 event for diplomats at the Republican National Convention. And the second was a private meeting in Sessions’ former Senate office in September. Who initiated the private meeting and what was discussed is so far unknown. In specifying that she never met with Kislyak on Armed Services Committee business, "McCaskill seems to have inadvertently supported Sessions’ claims," said Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "She made an unequivocal statement and then had to go back and qualify it by saying she was speaking just about one of her roles and not the other." Our ruling McCaskill said, "I’ve been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years. No call or meeting w/ Russian ambassador. Ever." McCaskill’s own tweets show that she has had an in-person group meeting, as well as a phone call, with the Russian ambassador in the past four years. A McCaskill spokesperson contrasted these interactions with the private one-on-one meeting Sessions had in his office with the ambassador. However, though the context for McCaskill’s and Sessions’ interactions with Kislyak may be very different, she goes too far in saying she didn’t "ever" have that meeting or phone call. We rate McCaskill’s claim False. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Claire McCaskill	None	None	None	2017-03-02T17:34:39	2017-03-02	['Russia']
pomt-00168	"The Postal Service only gives tribal residents PO boxes. The Republican-controlled Supreme Court just said it’s totally okay for North Dakota to demand that ONLY residents with street addresses can vote. Native Americans were the last to get the right to vote, and now they are the first to lose it."	half-true	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/23/occupy-democrats/native-americans-werent-last-get-right-vote-occupy/	A viral image about Native American voting rights in North Dakota called a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision "disgraceful." The liberal advocacy group Occupy Democrats circulated a graphic in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Oct. 9 decision not to intervene in a challenge to North Dakota’s voter ID law that would require voters to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that displays a current residential street address. The graphic was posted to Occupy Democrats’ Facebook page along with a link to an American Civil Liberties Union article encouraging users to read more. The image shows a picture of Chief Joseph, a leader of the Nez Percé tribe in the Pacific Northwest, along with a paragraph about how the decision will affect Native Americans: "The Postal Service only gives tribal residents PO boxes. The Republican-controlled Supreme Court just said it’s totally okay for North Dakota to demand that ONLY residents with street addresses can vote. Native Americans were the last to get the right to vote, and now they are the first to lose it." This image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It had been shared on Facebook more than 52,000 times. There are a lot of parts to this claim, so we will take them one by one. Recent changes to North Dakota’s voter ID laws Signed into law by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum in April 2017, HB 1369 requires a voter to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that includes their legal name, date of birth and current residential street address in North Dakota. The bill stipulates that a driver’s license, Department of Transportation-issued ID, or tribal government-issued ID are acceptable forms of identification, and allows for other documents, such as a utility bill or paycheck, to supplement missing or outdated information. North Dakota is the only state without voter registration, abolishing it in 1951, according to the Secretary of State’s office. A group of eight Native Americans from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa had already been in a legal battle with the state over voting rights when Burgum enacted Republican-led HB 1369. So, in December 2017, the plaintiffs, represented by attorneys for the Native American Rights Fund, amended their original January 2016 complaint, Brakebill vs. Jaeger, and asked a federal judge to declare the new law unconstitutional. They argued it violates the national Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs argued that the law was discriminatory because, "most tribal IDs do not have a residential address printed on them. This is due, in part, to the fact that the U.S. postal service does not provide residential delivery in these rural Indian communities. Thus, most tribal members use a PO Box." Reached by email, Occupy Democrats told PolitiFact that the organization should have specified in their graphic that Native Americans "in remote areas" use PO boxes. "But we stand by the general veracity of the statement, especially with regards to this specific example in North Dakota," Occupy Democrats wrote in the Oct. 18 email. In April, Judge Daniel L. Hovland of the U.S. District Court of North Dakota blocked the bill’s new requirements from being enforced. However, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision, allowing the street address requirement to be implemented in the upcoming midterm elections. In September, the Native American Rights Fund took the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to vacate the Eighth Circuit’s decision. The Supreme Court’s ruling Occupy Democrats’ graphic also said, "The Republican-controlled Supreme Court just said it’s totally okay for North Dakota to demand that ONLY residents with street addresses can vote." The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on Brakebill vs. Jaeger was 6-2, with justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissenting. Newly appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate in the decision. It is generally accepted by political scholars, however, that Kavanaugh’s addition to the court means there is a conservative-majority tilt. With the Supreme Court declining to intervene, North Dakota’s voter ID law and its street address requirements will remain in place. However, the U.S. Supreme Court didn’t make a legal determination on the basis of North Dakota’s law. It simply decided not to intervene. Were Native Americans the last to get the right to vote? The graphic also said, "Native Americans were the last to get the right to vote, and now they are the first to lose it." That’s partially accurate, but the timeline of American voting rights is far less cut-and-dried than that statement might suggest. Over the course of history, all but a very small segment of the people who live in the U.S. have had to fight for the right to vote. At the nation’s founding in 1776, only property-owning Protestants over the age of 21 (most of whom were white and male) were given the right to vote. Everyone else had to see laws changed in order to cast a ballot. In 1870, the passage of the 15th Amendment meant that, in theory, African-American men could vote. In 1920, the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote. In 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act gave Native Americans citizenship rights, including the right to vote. And in 1952, the McCarren-Walter Act eliminated laws that prevented Asians from becoming naturalized citizens, which included voting rights. In each case, however, the law on the books didn’t necessarily reflect what was happening when people showed up at their polling places to try to cast a ballot. In reality, Native Americans were turned away from casting ballots in New Mexico and Arizona until 1948, when courts ruled in their favor against state government. In Utah, Native Americans weren’t allowed to vote until 1957, becoming the last of America’s indigenous people to be formally recognized as citizens. But it wasn’t until President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the United States applied strong legal spackle to the question of voting rights, filling in the many holes and cracks that, for hundreds of years, permitted elections officials to discriminate against citizens who sought to cast a ballot on Election Day. The new law was primarily championed by black Civil Rights leaders, but it ultimately extended protections to people of all backgrounds by prohibiting poll taxes, literacy tests, election fraud and voter intimidation — tactics that had been used to thwart Native Americans from voting. Does a PO Box really mean you can’t vote? Occupy Democrats’ graphic claimed that because of the Supreme Court’s decision, Native Americans in North Dakota who only have PO boxes will be unable to vote. However, news reports show that tribal officials and a voting rights advocacy group called Four Directions are working with the Secretary of State’s office to pave ways for those who have PO boxes to be able to go to their polling places with other documentation that will allow them to cast their ballots. These include efforts to help residents secure other acceptable forms of ID to present at the polls. The Associated Press on Oct. 19 reported that "tribal officials can issue a tribal voting letter with the eligible voter's name, date of birth and residential address at polling locations on reservations," a proposal that Deputy Secretary of State Jim Silrum said would be considered valid ID. In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg noted that the numbers of North Dakota residents who are affected by this change is significant: "1) 70,000 North Dakota residents -- about 20 percent of the turnout in a regular quadrennial election -- lack qualifying ID; and 2) approximately 18,000 residents lack supplemental documentation sufficient to permit them to vote without an ID." That means that voting rights advocates have a huge job ahead of them to ensure those affected by the law are able to go to the polls with acceptable ID. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said that the U.S. Postal Service only gives tribal residents PO Boxes and that because the Supreme Court decided not to intervene in North Dakota’s voter ID law, Native Americans will lose the right to vote. While rural tribal residents in North Dakota are issued PO Boxes for addresses, it is not true that all tribal residents only have PO Boxes. And a conservative-leaning court did rule to let stand a new North Dakota voter ID law that requires a voter to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that includes their legal name, date of birth and current residential street address — but the new ninth member did not participate. North Dakota’s law does pose obstacles for many tribal citizens who don’t have street addresses. However, through the work of voter rights advocates and officials with the Secretary of State’s office, there are ways that Native American voters who have PO boxes instead of residential street addresses will be able to vote. The law does not mean they are losing their right to vote altogether. The group also said that Native Americans were the last U.S. citizens to be granted the right to vote and the first to lose them. Native Americans in Utah were the last ethnic group to be recognized by both state and federal law as citizens with voting rights. But it wasn’t until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that federal law more thoroughly addressed issues of voter discrimination for all people, giving underrepresented voters of many ethnicities the actual right and means to vote.

pomt-00011	"We had a waiting list in Chittenden County when I came into office of about 700. ... We opened a new treatment hub in St. Albans, and it reduced that number to zero."	half-true	/vermont/statements/2018/nov/08/phil-scott/vermonts-governor-inflating-his-record-when-it-com/	The Department of Health estimates about 8,000 people in the state are in treatment for opioid use disorder. The state has had wait times for treatment off and on for more than five years and has struggled to ensure that professionals can meet the demand. During his successful re-election campaign, Republican Gov. Phil Scott touted his administration's overwhelming success in fighting opioid addiction. "We had a waiting list (for drug treatment) in Chittenden County when I came into office of about 700," Scott said at a gubernatorial debate in Rutland last month. "We opened a new treatment hub in St. Albans, and it reduced that number to zero." That gave us pause – did waitlists for treatment in Chittenden plummet from 700 to zero during Scott’s tenure? We asked the campaign for evidence to back up the candidate’s claims, but we never heard back. The Vermont Department of Health, however, closely tracks waitlists at the state’s six "hubs," the regional centers where people addicted to opioids can get high-intensity medication-assisted treatment. State data indicates the governor is off on the original waitlist number – by several hundred. In January 2017, when Scott took office, there were 145 people on hub waitlists statewide, and only 134 on the waitlist for the Chittenden hub. Hubs are the lynchpin of Vermont’s hub-and-spoke drug treatment model. Drug treatment is typically initiated at hubs, where people suffering from opioid abuse disorder can get daily doses of their medication, along with counseling and referrals to social services. Less intensive services are provided at so-called "spokes," a collection of about 90 providers made up of doctor’s offices and community clinics, where patients can get follow-up care. The numbers tracked by the state do show a precipitous decline in waitlists at hubs since 2017. In fact, in 2018, there were no waitlists for treatment at any hubs in March, May, June, July and August, the last month for which data is available. In Chittenden County, the state hasn’t counted a single person on a waitlist at the Howard Center’s Chittenden Clinic, the regional hub for Chittenden and Addison counties, from September 2017 to August 2018, except for one blip in April 2018, when two people were on the waitlist. Dana Poverman, the director of Medication Assisted Treatment at the Howard Center Chittenden Clinic, said the number on the waitlist is still zero. "We’ve really come a long way in terms of access to medicine-assisted treatment," she said. That’s thanks in large part, Poverman said, to the opening of the state’s sixth hub in St. Albans and a dramatic increase in spoke providers. Less is known about what waitlists look like at Vermont’s spokes. The state doesn’t formally track how many people might be waiting for treatment from providers. Beth Tanzman, the executive director of the Blueprint for Health, which oversees the spokes, says the state has "a pretty good sense of what access looks like" through regular check-ins. "Our understanding right now is that we are able to get everyone into care easily within 72 hours," she said. In Chittenden County, people are typically able to access same-day treatment, Tanzman said. In Middlebury and Springfield, where there is a dearth of spoke providers, immediate care is more difficult to obtain. Our ruling In trumpeting Vermont’s success tackling the opioid epidemic, Scott said waitlists for treatment in Chittenden County had fallen from about 700 to zero. He’s right that, according to available data, there is basically no longer a waitlist for treatment at Chittenden’s regional hub at the Howard Center. But he’s completely off the mark when it comes to how long the waitlist was when he first came into office. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-12463	"We have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, ‘Phooey, nonsense, I’m not going to participate in your program, because it doesn’t do what I need done.’ "	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/may/08/tom-price/tom-price-misleads-obamacare-tax-penalty/	Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price argued that people are currently uninsured because they don’t like Obamacare. "When I talk to the doctors that I used to practice with right here in Atlanta, what they tell me is that the current system isn't working for them or for their patients," Price said in a May 7 interview on CNN’s State of the Union. "We have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, ‘Phooey, nonsense, I'm not going to participate in your program because it doesn't do what I need done," he said. "So, they are paying a penalty. They're paying the IRS a fine or a penalty because the federal government is dictating to them what they don't want to do, or they are saying, give me a waiver." Price’s characterization leaves out a lot. Many of the 20 million are likely uninsured not as a personal preference, but because they still can’t find coverage. Penalty under the Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act includes an individual mandate to urge people to obtain health care coverage. The mandate that began in 2014 penalizes individuals for each month they lack health insurance that meets the minimum essential coverage. The penalty is assessed on tax returns and increases every year a person remains uninsured. The fee is whichever is higher: 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per adult or $347.50 per child. The mandate has many exemptions depending on income, membership in groups like Indian tribes, and incarceration. If individuals don’t fall into those categories, the health insurance marketplace lays out 14 categories that exempt people from the financial penalty if they cannot afford it, such as being homeless or filing for bankruptcy. The American Health Care Act passed by the House May 4 gets rid of the individual mandate, one of the least popular provisions of the law. In January, the Internal Revenue Service reported that in 2016 about 80 percent of taxpayers -- 117 million -- indicated on tax forms that they had qualifying coverage all year while about 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions. The most common exemption was for people who earned below a certain threshold in a state that didn’t expand Medicaid. Additionally, the IRS reported that 6.5 million taxpayers were paying a fine instead of getting insurance. Add that to the people who claimed exemptions from the penalty, and that totals 19.2 million, close to Price’s 20 million. Still, that means just over 60 percent of the 20 million who aren’t insured are claiming exemptions. Steven Ullmann, director of the University of Miami’s Department of Health Sector Management and Policy, said millions of people struggle to find coverage because they aren’t eligible for Medicaid due to states not expanding Medicaid. There are also those who don’t qualify for the federal subsidy to purchase insurance through the exchanges. "They are uninsured because there is no way that they can afford the insurance," he said. "Then there are others, generally the ‘young invincibles,’ who find that the penalty of $695 is less than the cost of the insurance policies (generally over $2,000 a year)," he said. "They’d rather go bare and take their chances." The penalty hasn’t had its intended effect of driving people to sign up for health care, said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts. "To be effective, the penalty almost certainly needs to be bigger," he said. "And for a lot of obvious political reasons, that sort of tougher penalty is not in the cards now, nor was it plausible when the ACA was drafted. A weak penalty was the original sin of Obamacare." Price's office didn't respond to our queries. His claim is similar to a statement by President Donald Trump at a Feb. 27 meeting with health insurance company executives. "It's gotten so bad that nearly 20 million Americans have chosen to pay the penalty or received an exemption rather than buy insurance," Trump said. (That claim was debunked by fact-checkers including the Washington Post and CNN.) On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that gave federal agencies broad authority to defer or delay any part of the Affordable Care Act that costs anybody any money, including the penalty. The IRS said in February that it was reviewing Trump’s order "but that legislative provisions of the ACA law are still in force until changed by the Congress, and taxpayers remain required to follow the law and pay what they may owe‎." Our ruling Price said, "We have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, ‘Phooey, nonsense, I’m not going to participate in your program, because it doesn’t do what I need done.’ " Price mentioned the number of people who are either paying a fine because they don't have insurance or who are claiming an exemption, usually because they don't qualify for affordable coverage. About 6.5 million taxpayers reported the penalty in 2016 tax filings, and 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions, bringing the total to about 20 million. But Price makes it sound like all of those people are simply declining coverage. In reality, many can't qualify for affordable coverage, even if they would like to. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10905	"U.S. Steel just announced that they are building six new steel mills."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/02/donald-trump/us-steel-not-opening-six-new-mills-donald-trump/	President Donald Trump has boasted about big growth in the steel industry at campaign-style rallies this summer. "U.S. Steel just announced that they are building six new steel mills," Trump said July 31 in Tampa. "And that number is soon going to be lifted, but I'm not allowed to say that, so I won't." Trump repeated the company would open six major facilities at a roundtable in Minnesota on June 20 and again at a lunch with members of Congress on June 26. That was one mill down from when he said the company was going to open seven on July 27. That would be huge news, given the company only has four steelmaking facilities in the United States. But there’s no evidence on their website that any new mills are on the horizon. Meghan Cox, a spokeswoman for U.S. Steel, told us that Trump wasn’t privy to any exclusive information. "All of our operational changes have been publicly announced and all information shared with the federal government has been properly disclosed and made available on our website," Cox said. (The White House did not respond to our request for comment.) Cox pointed to several projects U.S. Steel announced this year. That includes plans to invest $275 million to $325 million in capital projects, announced in February; to construct a new steel-coating line to help PRO-TEC, a subsidiary, make cars in Leipsic, Ohio; and to restart two blast furnaces that will create 800 new jobs at an integrated steel-making plant in Granite City. The company idled those furnaces in 2015, laying off about 2,000 workers. Mills are complex operations, so we asked William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, whether a single plant might be easily mistaken for multiple plants. "On its face, it makes no sense," Reinsch said. "A plant is a plant, not a division of something or part of a facility. I don’t see how you get to six from anything I know." None of those are new plants, but they represent investment and job-creating activities. That said, other American steelmakers have announced new mills and re-openings this year. Nucor, a steel manufacturer, announced in November it would open a steel rebar micro-mill in Sedalia, Mo., creating 250 full-time jobs. Nucor will build another mill in Frostproof, Fla., the company announced in March. Liberty Steel bought and is preparing to reopen a steel mill in Georgetown, S.C. The mill was shuttered by its previous owners in 2015. And Big River Steel is investing $1.2 billion to expand its Arkansas steel plant. U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt did not address the mysterious six mills in a second quarter conference call with investors Aug. 2. But Burditt affirmed Trump's support for the steel industry. "We had an incredibly exciting visit form the president, and his daughter was there as well, and I can tell you the commitment that he has to steel is unprecedented, and the notion that this guy would blink, I think, is not going to happen," Burritt said. "He knows this kind of unfairness should been taken care of long ago. He’s got us, he’s with us." Our ruling Trump said, "U.S. Steel just announced that they are building six new steel mills."

pomt-13581	Says Arizona congressional candidate Ray Strauss is "a ‘Champion of Big Government’ for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/aug/18/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-claims-arizona-congressional-candidate/	Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin expressed her discontent for Republicans in name only, or RINOs, while talking about Arizona’s District 4 congressional race. The Aug. 30 Republican primary is a two-man contest between three-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar of Prescott and challenger Ray Strauss of Buckeye, whom Palin called a "malleable politician" willing to compromise. "In other words, to sell us out, raise taxes, and spend more of your hard-earned money," Palin said in an Aug. 11 Facebook post supporting Gosar. "Dr. Gosar's opponent is actually classified by Americans for Prosperity for being a ‘Champion of Big Government' for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council." Palin was referring to Strauss, who served on the Buckeye City Council from June 2010 through May 2016. We wondered whether Palin’s claims against Gosar’s opponent held any weight. Not for taxes We did not hear back from Palin or Strauss, but Gosar campaign spokesman Tom Van Flein pointed us to the Americans for Prosperity's 2016 scorecard. This conservative group, which advocates for limited government, annually grades local and state politicians based on their fiscal voting record. Their scale ranges from Hero of the Taxpayer to Hero of Big Government: According to his most recent scorecard for calendar year 2015, AFP did give Strauss a grade of "Champion of Big Government." But that doesn’t tell the whole story. In June 2015, the Buckeye City Council unanimously approved a $258 million budget for fiscal year 2015-16, $73 million more than the previous fiscal year. "The (sic) rating in calendar year 2015 was for voting for a 39 percent increase in the city’s approved budget, from $185 million in fiscal year 2015 to $258 million in fiscal year 2016," Americans for Prosperity Arizona state director Tom Jenney said. However, Strauss -- and the rest of the council -- did not vote to increase taxes. They actually approved a lower property tax rate of $1,800 per $100,000 of accessed property value. Despite a lower tax rate, some homeowners may still pay more in taxes if their home is worth more, but it varies. "It’s the assessed value on any given property that dictates whether someone’s overall taxes increase or decrease," said Buckeye finance director Larry Price. "She got her years wrong or just flat out missed it." Moreover, while Strauss did get a "Champion of Big Government" rating for calendar year 2015, from calendar year 2007 through calendar year 2015, he averaged a score of -1, or "Needs Much Improvement." And in calendar year 2014, AFP actually gave him a "Friend of the Taxpayer" rating. We also examined the minutes for all the Buckeye City Council meetings in 2015 and found that Strauss voted against resolutions thought to be pro-government. In August 2015, he voted against two resolutions for city employee raises, including one that would give raises to employees based on the city’s financial scope. By comparison, Gosar received a perfect score from AFP, as his congressional votes coincided with the group’s position. Our ruling Palin said, "Dr. Gosar's opponent is actually classified by Americans for Prosperity for being a ‘Champion of Big Government' for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council." That’s misleading and leaves out important context. The opponent in question, Ray Strauss, did not vote to raise taxes that year while on the Buckeye City Council. And while the group did give him that rating in 2015, it wasn't a lifetime rating. Palin cherry-picks one year. On average, he has a much more moderate score from AFP.

pomt-11538	"The president has been very clear. All forms of abuse, all forms of battery against women are deplorable and disgusting. ... He’s said that multiple times in the past."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/13/hogan-gidley/has-trump-often-spoken-out-against-abuse-women-no/	Two White House staffers have resigned after credible reports that they abused their wives, but those departures haven’t quieted the waters. If anything, the question of what President Donald Trump thinks about these episodes grew more pressing after Trump tweeted broadly about people accused of abuse in any form. "People’s lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation," Trump tweeted Feb. 10. "Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com When asked on Fox News why Trump hasn't publicly condemned men who beat their wives, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said there should be no doubt where he stands. "The president has been very clear," Gidley said Feb. 12. "All forms of abuse, all forms of battery against women are deplorable and disgusting." Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade interjected, "But he hasn’t said that." "You haven’t talked to him today," Gidley said. "Obviously, he’s said that multiple times in the past. I’ve talked to the president about issues surrounding this type of behavior and he finds it disgusting." Still, whatever Trump's private thoughts might be, he has held his tongue in the present controversy involving his former aide Rob Porter. Trump did sign a statement about domestic violence. On Sept. 30, 2017, he proclaimed October 2017 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. "I call on all Americans to promote the safety and liberty of the women, men, and children who are subjected to violent, intimidating, or controlling behavior at the hands of those closest to them," the proclamation read. "Each of us must be a voice for those suffering in silence and must speak up when we see signs of physical or emotional abuse. Together we can bolster victims’ support networks and encourage and empower them to report offenses." That was one of more than 100 proclamations Trump has signed on topics ranging from National Financial Accountability Month to Irish-American Heritage Month. On domestic violence, publicly, Trump has yet to follow through on his own call to action. We searched the Nexis news database. We looked through his tweets. ​We found nothing that came from him in his own words recently and clearly decrying domestic abuse as a disgusting act. The closest we found was in 2015 when Trump attacked Hillary Clinton for her husband’s behavior. "If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong," he tweeted Dec. 28, 2015. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Two years earlier, Trump chastised the military for failing to curtail rape and domestic violence within its ranks. "Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife. What is going on," Trump tweeted May 17, 2013. He continued with, "General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control." The White House pointed to Trump’s 2012 comment related to singer Rihanna’s personal life. "If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish," Trump tweeted Oct. 11, 2012. "A beater is always a beater--just watch!" See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com There are press reports that in private Trump has taken a more negative view, though we can't independently verify them because they are based on anonymous sources. Significantly, Trump praised Porter in public after he resigned. "He did a very good job when he was in the White House," Trump told the TV cameras Feb. 9. "And we hope he has a wonderful career, and hopefully he will have a great career ahead of him. But it was very sad when we heard about it. And, certainly, he’s also very sad." Even some Republicans have said they want more from Trump. In an interview with CNN on Feb. 13, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said "abuse is never okay" and should not be tolerated among employees. Asked if the president is sending that signal, Ernst said, "I think he needs to send a stronger message, a stronger message." Our ruling Gidley said that on many occasions, Trump has said that abuse of women is disgusting and deplorable. Trump may have said such things privately, but his public stance has been quite different. Trump did sign a proclamation on domestic violence and — years ago, on Twitter — berated the military for allowing rape and abuse to undermine military readiness. But Trump has not conveyed his personal thoughts against domestic abuse when asked about the Porter case directly, and Gidley's comment left viewers with the wrong idea. Instead, Trump came out against a rush to judgment against those broadly accused of taking advantage of women, which might include physical abuse. And he described Porter's situation as "very sad" and wished him well in his career. If there’s a pattern of Trump decrying violence against women, it hasn’t left much of a visible trail.

pomt-14492	"A couple of debates ago, (Donald Trump) said if you don’t support socialized health care, you’re heartless."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/25/ted-cruz/cruz-invents-trump-statement-socialized-medicine/	In a free-for-all Republican debate in Houston, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz attacked frontrunner Donald Trump for his position on health care. "For decades, Donald has been advocating socialized medicine," Cruz said. "What he said is the government should pay for everyone’s health care. And in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said if you don’t support socialized health care, you’re heartless." Did Trump actually say that about socialized medicine? In a Republican debate? No. We looked at the transcripts going back a couple of months to the debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. We found Trump never used those words, nor anything close to them. There was an exchange in the Feb. 6 debate in Manchester, N.H., when socialized medicine came up, but it didn’t happen the way Cruz said. A question from panelist Mary Katherine Ham started the exchange. Ham: "Mr. Trump, you have said you want to repeal Obamacare. You have also said, quote, ‘Everybody’s got to be covered,’ adding, quote, ‘The government’s going to pay for it.’ Are you closer to Bernie Sanders’ vision for health care than Hillary Clinton’s?" Trump: "I don’t think I am. I think I’m closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare. We’re going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better." Trump talked with ABC moderator Martha Raddatz at the same debate about increasing competition among private insurance companies and he praised health savings accounts. He finished his answer this way: Trump: "What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don’t want that to happen. We’re going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else, and we’re going to take care of those people. "And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree, you’re not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country." Raddatz: "Sen. Cruz, to that point, Mr. Trump has said that your position on health care means that maybe you’ve got, quote, ‘no heart.’ There is a question here, though, about uncovered folks. You suggested repealing and replacing Obamacare. As we learned with President Obama’s broken promise that everyone could keep their plan, any major plan — change in health care policy carries with it the risk that some people will lose their insurance coverage or have to change it. How do you reassure that those people that repealing and replacing Obamacare is still in their best interest?" Cruz: "Well, let me take two different parts of that. Let me start with socialized medicine. Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine, that have put the government in charge of providing medicine, what inevitably happens is rationing." For the record, in the Dec. 15, 2015, debate, Trump called the country’s health care a "disaster. In the Jan. 14, 2016, debate, Trump said, "Our health care is a horror show. Obamacare, we’re going to repeal it and replace it." Government’s role Cruz also asserted that Trump had said the government should pay for everyone’s health care. We asked the Cruz campaign for their sources and didn’t hear back. But in an interview on CBS News’ 60 Minutes in September 2015, Trump did say, "Everybody's got to be covered." However, in context he was talking about people who don’t make enough money to pay for insurance. Asked what he would do and who would pay, Trump said, "I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people (and) the government's gonna pay for it." It’s clear from the full interview that Trump did not say that the government should pay for everyone’s health care. He made that point again in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on Jan. 31, 2016, saying that Cruz’s attacks showed "maybe he’s got no heart." Back in 1999, Trump did support a single-payer health care system for America. In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, he said, "We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing." Trump does not hold that belief today. Our ruling Cruz said that Trump said in a recent debate that "if you don’t support socialized health care, you’re heartless." Trump did not say those words, or anything like them, in any recent debate. He advanced the idea of more competition among private insurance companies, and he said that government should take care of those who can’t afford insurance. While there was a time in the past when Trump supported a single-payer plan, there’s no substance to Cruz’s statement. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-04508	"Right now, the (Congressional Budget Office) says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-20-million-will-lose-health-insur/	During the first presidential debate in Denver, Mitt Romney criticized President Barack Obama’s health care law by saying, "Right now, the (Congressional Budget Office) says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year." While PolitiFact does not put predictions to the Truth-O-Meter, we do fact-check whether politicians or pundits accurately portray the predictions made by others. We did so in June, when Romney made a similar claim in a speech -- that "Obamacare … means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep." We rated that claim False. We’ll take another look at the claim here. Cherry-picking the CBO report When we checked with the Romney campaign last June, a spokesman said the source of Romney’s claim was a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. The Romney campaign re-confirmed that source after the debate. The CBO study was undertaken to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer. CBO came up with a "baseline" estimate -- its best guess. CBO settled on a range of 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people obtaining coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies means a decline of an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but it’s quite a bit lower than 20 million. So where did 20 million come from? CBO supplemented its "baseline" estimate with four alternative, and wildly divergent, estimates. One resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The other scenarios resulted in a decline of 10 million, a decline of 12 million, and -- here it is -- a decline of 20 million. A number of other estimates by groups other than CBO have tracked with CBO’s baseline estimate, rather than with Romney’s figure. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016. So the 20 million number Romney cited does come from CBO, and he hedged by saying "up to." But it’s the most extreme outcome of the five presented, and it’s not the primary estimate. Some who "lose" coverage will do so because they find better options Even beyond the cherry-picking, Romney is wrong to say that 20 million Americans will "lose" their insurance. According to CBO’s "baseline" estimates, 3 million people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance "exchanges" created under the Obama health care law. In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. Romney also ignores 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before the Obama law, but who will get employer coverage after passage of the law, perhaps because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers. It’s also important to remember the big picture. CBO projects that, overall, the number of uninsured Americans will drop by 29 million to 31 million due to the law. It’s not as if no one ever loses coverage today As we have previously noted, many Americans lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law, though figuring out exactly how many is surprisingly tricky. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that, on average, slightly more than 3 percent of employees leave their jobs in any given month. But you don’t have to change jobs to see your plan change. Your employer may change insurance carriers, or the insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan. How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population "switched" health insurance. All told, this churn -- which, to reiterate, is happening because of forces beyond the Obama health care law -- almost certainly dwarfs the scale of the changes Romney is talking about. Even Romney’s cherry-picked number of 20 million amounts to 7 percent of the 270 million non-elderly people in the U.S. CBO’s preferred figure represents an even smaller share -- 1 percent to 2 percent. Our ruling Romney said, "Right now, the (Congressional Budget Office) says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year." That number is cherry-picked, and many of those 20 million will be leaving employer coverage voluntarily for better options. Romney also ignores that under the status quo, many more people today "lose" coverage than even the highest, cherry-picked CBO estimate. We rate his statement False.

pomt-08093	Mt. Hood Community College is No. 1 on average and top faculty pay and benefits.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/15/mt-hood-community-college/mhcc-says-it-cant-afford-salaries-we-can-no-longer/	Administrators and faculty at Mount Hood Community College are negotiating a new contract in a tight budget year. The 2010-11 budget is expected to fall $5 million short of projected needs. Administrators want to curb salaries and benefits, arguing that faculty at the two-year school in Gresham are the most generously compensated in the Northwest. Mt. Hood enrolls about 33,000 students and is in the top five of Oregon's 17 community colleges. It lacks the profile given its larger sisters -- Portland and Clackamas community colleges -- yet, here are two surprising claims from Mt. Hood’s website and press release: MHCC full-time faculty have the highest average pay among all 54 community colleges in Oregon, Washington and Idaho. (Source: National Education Association (NEA) data, April 2010). Based on 2009-10 data, the base salary for full-time faculty at the top step is 8.2 percent above the average of the five comparator schools ($80,864 v. $74,735). The five Oregon community colleges most like MHCC are Chemeketa, Clackamas, Lane, Linn-Benton and Portland. In a Nov. 22 statement, the college says: "We can no longer pay salaries to our most experienced faculty that are far above the average of community colleges in Oregon, Washington and Idaho." PolitiFact Oregon never realized community college pay could be so rewarding to paychecks, and so crushing to a school’s budget. The numbers, we figured, would be easy to vet. In the faculty negotiations section of Mt. Hood’s website is a link to the National Education Association’s higher education salary study, released this spring. The average salary for faculty at Mt. Hood was $69,200 in 2008-09 -- indeed the highest of 17 community colleges in Oregon, 34 community colleges in Washington, and three schools in Idaho. The average benefit at Mt. Hood for the year was $27,800, again the highest of 54 colleges. Total average pay and benefits came to $97,000. For context, average faculty pay at Portland Community College, the state’s largest two-year, was $62,100 with benefits at $23,800 for a total $85,900 in 2008-09. Faculty at Clackamas Community College averaged $66,000 in salary and $24,600 in benefits, for a total $90,600. (It looks as if Mt. Hood and Clackamas were more in line in 2007-08. Average compensation at Mt. Hood was $94,400, and $93,900 at Clackamas. Salaries are based on nine- or 10-month contracts.) So you can check the first claim as True. The second claim is that base salary for full-time faculty at top scale at Mt. Hood was more than 8 percent higher than average top pay of community colleges closest in size to Mt. Hood, in 2009-10. The numbers pencil out, based on Mt. Hood’s figures. The average of top salaries at Clackamas, Chemeketa, Linn-Benton, Lane and Portland community colleges is $74,735, compared with $80,864 at Mt. Hood, or a difference of 8.2 percent. We checked with contracts for the individual schools and confirmed that Mt. Hood’s figures are pretty much correct, with the exception of Lane Community College, which was off by roughly $1,000 so the difference is actually 7.3 percent. In any case, it’s a similar sized gap. But Shannon Valdivia, a speech instructor at Mt. Hood, raises an excellent question of calendar years. Colleges differ in how many days to expect of faculty. So faculty at Mt. Hood and at Portland worked 180-day calendars in 2009-10; Linn-Benton faculty worked 164 days; Chemeketa, Clackamas and Lane had 175 days. Calculate by day, and top earners at Linn-Benton earned the most at $475 a day. Mt. Hood came in second with $449 earned a day. The average of the five schools was $431.24 a day -- or 4 percent less than Mt. Hood’s $449. Now, we’re skipping comparisons based on health benefits because faculty choose different types of plans. But know that Mt. Hood is on the nicer side with faculty kicking in a maximum of $75 a month for family coverage. On a per-day basis, top base pay at Mt. Hood and Linn-Benton are comparable. So we’ll rate claim No. 2 Half True. So, why is pay at Mt. Hood so high? Well, more than half of the 156 faculty at the college are at top scale. That’s a large percentage. Eighty people are in step 1 of a 14-step pay scale; 76 are in steps 2 to 14. The faculty union says some people were hired at too high a step; college administrators say the increase between steps is too big. (Faculty climb from one "step" to the next once a year; people who are at the top step will get cost-of-living adjustments if bargained for.) But that’s neither here nor there. If you combine the two claims together, we rate the overall claim on pay as Mostly True. It’s accurate -- average pay is high in large part because top tier pay is high, and so many people are in that top tier -- but it needs just a tiny bit of additional information on pay broken down by day.

pomt-08982	"We had 2 percent of the global market (for advanced batteries) when he (Obama) started. We now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/15/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-us-will-have-40-percent-global-/	President Barack Obama has repeatedly stressed the need for the U.S. to get out front in the production of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. One of the main obstacles has been that few American manufacturers were producing advanced batteries to power those vehicles. The economic stimulus championed by Obama included $2.4 billion to spur the creation of electric vehicle battery and component manufacturing plants. And this week, the White House repeatedly boasted that those investments are starting to pay off. Nine new battery plants have opened with the help of stimulus money, and the White House says four will be operational by the end of the year. The White House says higher-volume domestic manufacturing of advanced batteries will greatly reduce the cost of batteries -- which is crucial if electric vehicles are to become a viable option for car-buyers. On ABC's This Week on July 11, 2010, White House adviser David Axelrod said the stimulus has made the U.S. a global player in the advanced battery market. "He (Obama) is going on Thursday to Michigan to a plant that produces advanced batteries for electric cars," Axelrod said. "We had 2 percent of the global market when he started. We now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015, because we helped spur and leverage private investment, and that's what we want to do." That's quite a leap, and so we decided to check it out. The first part of Axelrod's equation -- that the U.S. had 2 percent of the global market at the start of the Obama presidency -- is defensible. There wasn't much advanced battery production being done then, except for hybrid electric vehicles. And, at that time, according to a 2008 report from the Department of Energy, only one company was assembling batteries in the U.S. for mass-produced vehicles. They were making batteries for the Saturn Vue. The Ford Escape Hybrid was being assembled in the U.S., but the batteries came from Asia. In any case, that one company, Cobasys, commanded a 2 percent share of the batteries supplied in 2008, according to the report. As for where Axelrod got the other figures -- that "we now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015" -- the White House press office pointed us toward a Deutsche Bank study of announced capacity to produce lithium ion batteries. The study projected the U.S. would have 20 percent by 2012 and up to 40 percent by 2015. Unlike Axelrod, the White House press office noted that these estimates are about capacity, not actual production. The projection of capacity by Deutsche Bank "pretty well matches with the other projections of announced capacity," said Mike Millikin, editor of the Green Car Congress. "The Administration has certainly put its money toward boosting U.S. capacity," Millikin said. "However, what ultimately matters is production and purchases." In fact, many industry experts say capacity will far exceed demand for, and production of, advanced batteries. In April, 2010, Menahem Anderman, founder and chief executive of Total Battery Consulting, issued a report on plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) based on-site interviews with top technologists and executives at 20 major automakers and 15 current and prospective battery suppliers on three continents. "The government’s stimulus money will create severe overcapacity from 2013 on," Anderman told PolitiFact. "There is no market for the capacity planned." That's because demand for the cars is limited by high up-front cost and still-evolving battery technology. "Unfortunately the mass EV and PHEV market at current gasoline pricing and battery technology status (cost, performance and life) will require unaffordable heavy subsidies to carmakers, battery makers and the consumer," Anderman said. And because the market is so dependent on government subsidies, he said, it is risky. "Our projections are that the combined EV/PHEV world new vehicle market will be on the order of 200,000 vehicles in 2015 and 1 million in 2020," Anderman said. "The government-paid battery plants that are supposed to be operational by 2013 will be heavily underutilized for years; they will have enough capacity to support the 2020 U.S. market." "Indeed the U.S. will have many unutilized plants," Anderman predicted. "The major Japanese players (Sanyo, Panasonic, Hitachi) hesitate to invest in EV batteries since they are skeptical about the EV market." Any suggestion that sales of actual batteries will follow announced planned capacity is naive, he said. Many companies that received stimulus money don't have a proven battery ready for mass production and are at least several years away from being qualified by major car companies. And with no experience running a high-volume automated Lithium Ion battery plant, Anderman said, most of the companies will face a slow and costly learning curve. "Nobody can predict market share for 2015, but I will be surprised if U.S. will get much more than 10 percent," Anderman said. "There are 5 major Japanese suppliers and two Korean that are 10 years ahead in manufacturing experience." The Freedonia Group, a Cleveland-based industry market research firm, estimated that in 2017, the U.S. will command 9 percent of the world market (dollar-wise) for lithium-based rechargeable batteries, including those for electric vehicles. Our biggest issue with Axelrod's claim is that he mixes two different statistics. The 2 percent figure represents actual production; the 16 percent, going to 40 percent by 2015, figures are for capacity. Those are two different things. In a July 15, 2010, speech at a new advanced battery factory in Holland, Mich., which was seeded with stimulus cash, Obama worded the statistic more carefully. "Just a few years ago, American businesses manufactured only 2 percent of the world’s advanced batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles -- 2 percent," Obama said. "But because of what’s happening in places like this, in just five years we’ll have up to 40 percent of the world’s capacity -- 40 percent." It takes a careful ear to discern that he's talking about two different statistics. And presented back-to-back, as they were, we think it's misleading. In fact, here's how a White House press release about advanced battery investments in the stimulus stated the statistic this week: "Pre-Recovery Act, the U.S. produced just 2 percent of the world’s batteries for advanced vehicles, but due to Recovery Act investments, the U.S. will have the capacity to produce 20 percent of these batteries by 2012 and up to 40 percent by 2015 - that’s a jump from 2 percent to 40 percent in a span of just five years." No, it's not a jump from 2 to 40. The 2 percent was a production number. The 40 percent is a capacity number. It remains to be seen how much of that capacity will be utilized. But most market analysts predict that the U.S. share of the advanced battery market -- actual sales of advanced batteries -- will be much lower than 40 percent. We rate Axelrod's comment Half True.

pomt-05343	Says in March New Jersey was "one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs" and "the state with the highest loss of jobs in the nation."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/13/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-blasts-chris-christies-new-jersey-co/	A Democratic lawmaker armed with bleak job numbers panned Gov. Chris Christie for championing a "New Jersey Comeback." "Comeback to what?" state Sen. Barbara Buono -- who is often mentioned as a potential 2013 gubernatorial candidate -- asked during a May 7 radio interview. "Right before he gave his State of the State address he released a YouTube trailer and he was talking about New Jersey's comeback has begun," Buono said on The Dom Giordano Show on 1210 WPHT-AM. "Maybe I'm missing something but comeback to what? You know the most recent jobs report [shows] that New Jersey lost over 11,000 private-sector jobs in March. Comeback to being one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs. Being the state with the highest loss of jobs in the nation. I don't know how that plays in a poll but I can tell you it doesn't sit right with New Jerseyans." Though Buono initially cited private-sector job loss, she said her comments referred to overall jobs. Either way, she’s wrong to claim that New Jersey was "one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs" in March, PolitiFact New Jersey found. While New Jersey’s national ranking differs slightly in March between total jobs and private-sector jobs, the state fared poorly by both measures. But highlighting job loss in one month ignores a larger trend: the state has added jobs in the past year. Buono’s office provided an April 20 blog post from the liberal New Jersey Policy Perspective to back her claims. The post said New Jersey "was one of only eight states in the country to lose jobs in March." That’s not true. New Jersey Policy Perspective corrected the post after we contacted them about it. New Jersey and 19 other states lost jobs in March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate increased in eight states, but other factors -- such as the size of the labor force -- impact that measure. New Jersey’s unemployment rate remained at 9 percent in March. So Buono’s wrong on that point. Her other claim isn't as straightforward. In March, New Jersey lost 11,600 private-sector jobs, more than any other state. But Buono said her comments referred to total jobs. Because of gains in government employment, the state’s total job loss was 8,600 in March. Only Ohio lost more jobs overall that month. Since a state’s population can skew rankings of net figures, it’s also important to note percentage growth or loss when talking about jobs. Wyoming and Maine fared worse than New Jersey by that measure for private-sector jobs and total jobs. So New Jersey had the "highest loss of jobs in the nation" in one category, but not the one Buono said she was referring to. Still, the state’s job loss ranks among the worst in the nation in March by any measure. Looking at the larger employment picture in New Jersey, Buono’s statement ignores the fact that the state has added 38,300 total jobs in the last year, from March 2011 to March 2012. The state posted job gains in nine of the last 12 months. Buono said in an e-mail: "Regarding your objection to drawing the inference discrediting the governor's claims of NJ ‘comeback’ let me say this. Job loss is one of the most important indicators of any economic recovery. The figures I used contrast with the governor's constant refrain of a ‘NJ Comeback.’" Our ruling While criticizing Christie, Buono said New Jersey was "one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs" and "the state with the highest loss of jobs in the nation." Though she preceded those comments by citing private-sector job loss in March, Buono said her statements referred to overall job loss in that month. Either way, 20 states lost jobs in March, not eight. New Jersey ranked, in both net and percentage terms, among the worst states for job loss in March. But in the last year the state added jobs. On the Truth-O-Meter, this statement rates Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Barbara Buono	None	None	None	2012-05-13T07:30:00	2012-05-07	['None']
pomt-06133	"We have one of the highest percentages per capita of nonprofits in this state of any state in the union."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/25/anne-nolan/esident-rhode-islands-largest-homeless-shelter-say/	Times are tough for nonprofits. Financing from state and federal sources is down and people generally have less to give than before the recession. Anne Nolan, president of Crossroads Rhode Island, which operates the state’s largest homeless shelter, knows this first hand. On a recent episode of WJAR's "10 News Conference," she said that while more people are in need, there’s less money out there to help them. That’s undoubtedly true across the country, but, said Nolan, the problem in Rhode Island is exacerbated. "We have one of the highest percentages per capita of nonprofits in this state of any state in the union," she said on the show that aired Nov. 27. "There is a limited amount of funding, a limited number of donors out there, and that waters it all down." The Providence Journal reported Dec. 18 that donations to Crossroads were down in recent months in part because of its support of EngageRI, a business-backed group that pushed for an overhaul of the state retirement system. But we were also interested in Nolan's claim that because the state has such a high concentration of nonprofits, there’s greater competition here for financing than in other states. When we asked Nolan where she got her information, she said she thought it came from a study on Rhode Island’s nonprofit sector done either by the United Way of Rhode Island or the Rhode Island Foundation. The Rhode Island Foundation did publish a study in August on the state’s many nonprofits. According to the report, the number of active nonprofits registered with the secretary of state’s office in 2011 is 7,306. That sounds like a lot. But the list isn’t made up only of charities, foundations or social services groups. It also includes condominium associations, sports teams, religious groups and professional associations. Most are small. Two-thirds operate with budgets and assets of less than $100,000. The report also said that nonprofits employ more than 18 percent of Rhode Island’s labor force, tying us with New York as the states with the highest percentage of people working at nonprofits. That seems logical considering the high number of colleges and universities in Rhode Island and the large hospitals located here. But the report doesn’t make any comparisons among states based on the number of nonprofits per capita. The United Way published the results of a survey of Rhode Island nonprofit health and human service providers in March 2009. The survey focused on fiscal issues and how organizations’ finances were being affected by the recession. Sixty percent of the 230 respondents reported a decrease in total income over the prior year. The survey sheds some light on the struggles of nonprofits, but it doesn’t take up the per capita question either. We didn’t give up. We knew there must be some organization that keeps track of this sort of thing. That organization, it turns out, is the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based public policy think tank that was established in 1968 by the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. It keeps track of a range of statistics on nonprofits through its National Center for Charitable Statistics. A search of the institute’s website found a table titled "Number of Registered Nonprofit Organizations by State, 2008" -- the most recent year for data -- which was based on 990 Form filings with the Internal Revenue Service. According to the table, Rhode Island had 7,200 registered nonprofits in 2008, of which 4,959 were 501(c)(3) organizations, which include charities, foundations, hospitals, universities and social services groups such as Crossroads. Using an estimated 2008 population for Rhode Island of 1,050,788, the chart calculated a figure of 68.5 nonprofits per 10,000 people and 47.2 501(c)(3) groups per 10,000 people. That ranked Rhode Island 11th in the nation for nonprofits per capita and 8th for 501(c)(3) groups. Not surprisingly, Washington, D.C., ranked first with 250.3 nonprofits per 10,000 people and 158 501(c)(3) groups. But that number is skewed because many of the groups registered in the nation’s capital have a national or international focus. Most of the other states in the top 10 are geographically large with small populations, such as Montana (second in both categories), North Dakota (fifth in both categories) and South Dakota (sixth in the former category and seventh in the latter). The national average was 49.8 nonprofits per 10,000 people and 35.3 501(c)(3) groups. The Urban Institute also has interesting figures on charitable contributions that relate to Nolan’s larger point about an increasingly tough funding environment. Based on IRS data on tax returns, the average charitable contribution made by a Rhode Island individual dropped from $926 in 2004 to $787 in 2009. That brought Rhode Island’s ranking for the size of an individual’s charitable contribution down from 37th in the nation to 45th. In comparison, the average contribution in Massachusetts was $1,143 in 2009, which ranked 19th, and in Connecticut, it was $1,517, which ranked 4th. Our ruling Nolan’s point that Rhode Island nonprofits are having a more difficult time raising money is valid. People just aren’t giving as much these days. Whether Rhode Island has one of the highest per capita numbers of nonprofits is open to interpretation. The state isn’t among the top five in the country. It’s just outside the top 10. But the state does have the eighth-highest number of 501(c)(3) organizations per capita. These are the groups, like Crossroads, that provide health and social services and are the type that people probably think of when it comes to nonprofits. For that reason, we believe Nolan has a point, but her statement needed further explanation. We rule the claim Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-02165	"PolitiFact Texas gave" a David Dewhurst TV ad "a ‘Pants-on-Fire’ rating as an outrageous lie."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/may/01/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-tv-ad-incorrectly-says-pants-fire-slap/	In TV spots and a voter mailer, state Sen. Dan Patrick declares the Texas Truth-O-Meter found his opponent’s latest TV ad, hammering Patrick’s past financial troubles, to be a lie. That’s curious because we haven’t rated a full ad from anyone lately, including the anti-Patrick ad launched in April 2014 by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst after Patrick led Dewhurst in the March primary for the Republican lieutenant governor nomination; the two face a May 27 runoff. For this fact check, we’re reviewing a statement in a Patrick campaign mailer brought to our attention by a reader as well as Dewhurst campaign spokeswoman Eliza Vielma. The front side of the mailer shows Dewhurst with his hand half-raised, like a stop sign, and these words in red: "Bankruptcy, unpaid taxes, tax liens, unpaid debts, lawsuits." The other side shows a frowning Dewhurst with the word "lie" stamped on his forehead next to a depiction of the Politifact Truth-O-Meter, its arrow pointed at our most severe rating, Pants on Fire; flames dance around it. "David Dewhurst’s latest personal attack is a lie," the mailer’s text says. "Desperate and lagging in the polls, David Dewhurst has resorted to outright lies in an attempt to malign his opponent. He has spent over $1 million on airing a TV ad he knows is a lie. PolitiFact Texas gave the (Dewhurst) television ad a ‘Pants-on-Fire’ rating as an outrageous lie," the mailer says. This entire statement is attributed to PolitiFact Texas and it’s dated April 17, 2014. Dewhurst’s ad showed a woman sitting in an armchair suggesting Patrick’s personal bankruptcy, which was filed in the 1980s and resolved in 1992, raises doubts about his being able to run the state honestly. Key elements included a reporter asking Patrick in a debate about his walking away from over $800,000 in debts in the bankruptcy. The ad also referenced a Sept. 19, 2013, news story in the Dallas Morning News stating Patrick had numerous tax liens filed against him. On April 17, we rated as Pants on Fire another claim in Dewhurst’s ad--that Patrick changed his name to hide his debts. Patrick, who grew up as Dan Goeb, had gone by the name Dan Patrick as a broadcaster since the late 1970s but legally changed his name in 2003 in anticipation of running for public office--more than a decade after his personal bankruptcy case ended. Based on that time gap and an absence of other factual back-up, we found Dewhurst’s name-change statement incorrect and ridiculous. Dewhurst’s ad also said Patrick was caught not paying taxes and pocketed employees’ payroll taxes. On April 28, we rated this claim Half True. Government agencies had filed liens against Patrick for unpaid taxes in the 1980s. But we saw no proof Patrick pocketed employees’ payroll taxes. Logan Spence, Patrick’s campaign manager, stood by Patrick saying we found the entire Dewhurt ad a Pants on Fire lie. PolitiFact Texas "judged one attack as a pants-on-fire lie and the other attack as only half true," Spence said by email. "On the whole, it is completely accurate to say that the ad is a lie because it intentionally distorts the truth." Our ruling Patrick said "PolitiFact Texas gave" the Dewhurst TV ad "a ‘Pants-on-Fire’ rating as an outrageous lie." We didn’t rate the overall ad emphasizing Patrick’s past financial difficulties. Rather, we rated one of its claims Pants on Fire and another claim Half True. We rate Patrick’s statement, which overstates our findings, as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-05657	Says "the No. 2 cause of death in the U.S. (for) women under 50 is being killed by their spouse or domestic partner."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/19/rod-monroe/intimate-partner-violence-second-leading-cause-dea/	During the 2012 legislative session, lawmakers passed a bill that requires the state's school districts to put policies in place combating teen dating violence. The legislation passed with a pretty wide margin. During the debate, statistics were thrown out left and right in support of the new policy. One in particular caught our attention. While speaking in favor of House Bill 4077, Sen. Rod Monroe, D-Portland, said "teen dating violence is where it all starts, and where it ends is with the fact that the No. 2 cause of death in the U.S. (for) women under 50 is being killed by their spouse or domestic partner. No. 2 cause of death. Only exceeded by automobile accidents." There's no disputing that intimate partner violence, as it's commonly referred to in support circles, is a major problem nationally and worldwide. But could it really be the second leading cause of death for women under the age of 50? Monroe didn't have any support for his claim when we reached him at home. He mentioned that he'd heard the statistic some eight years ago at a conference in San Diego. Since then, he said, he'd read it in several articles. Without a lead, we had to start from scratch. Our first step was to check in with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has a specific division that looks into injury and violence prevention. As it happens, injury is the leading cause of death for Americans between ages 1 and 44. Gail Hayes, a spokeswoman for the Injury Center, showed us how to drill down into the data on hand. We looked for the leading causes of death for women between the ages of 1 and 50 from 1999 to 2009. This is what we found, in descending order: Malignant neoplasms (cancer), unintentional injury (largely motor vehicle accidents and poisoning), heart disease, suicide, stroke and then -- at sixth place -- homicide, which would include intimate partner violence. Unfortunately, you can't dig down any deeper into the homicide category to get a good idea of just how many of those are perpetrated by intimate partners. Even if we could have gone further, the rankings didn't seem to support Monroe. Once you remove biological causes of death -- cancer, heart attack and stroke -- homicide comes in at third place, after unintentional injuries and suicide. Hayes was kind enough to check in with some of the Injury Center scientists to see if they'd heard the statistic that Monroe cited. The best she could come up with was the fact that just over 41 percent of female homicides aged 1-50 were "intimate-partner related." But, she said, that data applied to only 16 states and couldn't be reliably nationalized. The CDC had some recent reports on the issues of intimate partner violence, but none of them referenced Monroe's statistic. Our next step was a call to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. We spoke with Angela Hale who also said she hadn't heard of the statistic that we were trying to verify. We did find a similar statistic referenced in the abstract for a paper published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery. Ultimately, that lead never panned out. The closest we could find was a another report from 1991 that stated "violence was the second most common cause of injury overall and the most common cause of injury of women aged 15-44." But violence didn't necessarily mean intimate partner violence. In fact, the only thing the article says about such violence is that 62 percent of the violent incidents involved husbands or boyfriends. Ultimately, we ended where we started: With no source to back up the claim. In the end, the onus is on the speaker to offer a source for what he said. Monroe didn't have one -- and after days of searching, we couldn't find one. There is no doubt that intimate partner violence is a serious issue, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence that it ranks as the No. 2 cause of the death for women under 50. The highest it might rank -- and even this is a stretch -- is sixth place, according to CDC data. We rate this claim False. Return to OregonLive to comment on this rating.

pomt-12754	Political activists are "being paid" to protest members of Congress.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/27/louie-gohmert/protesters-are-paid-disrupt-town-hall-meetings-goh/	Several Republican lawmakers have accused protesters at recent town hall-style meetings of being the tools of deep-pocketed benefactors pushing a liberal agenda. They’re being paid to demonstrate, some GOP officials say, with some activists being shipped in from out of state to Republican-led congressional districts to kick up an artificial fuss. U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas was one Republican who leveled the charge in a Feb. 21 statement. Gohmert was refusing to hold any constituent meetings because of protests elsewhere. "Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety," the statement read. His statement noted former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords "was shot at a public appearance," prompting Giffords to release a statement excoriating members of Congress who "have abandoned their civic obligations" to "have some courage" and "hold town halls." While Gohmert is not the only official to claim protesters are being paid, nothing has yet turned up to support those claims. The burden of proof still lies with the accusers, however, and Republicans haven’t been offering any evidence (and neither did Democrats when they made similar claims about the tea party a few years ago). Nothing proven First thing about these town hall protests: Crowds have been pretty raucous and confrontational, but not violent. Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham did not provide evidence that protesters had been paid. Also silent when we asked for proof was Jim DeMint, a former senator from South Carolina who now is president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. He told Greta Van Susteren on MSNBC on Feb. 22 that’s he’d been reading the Indivisible Guide, a handbook for grassroots protest compiled by several Democratic former congressional staffers. DeMint tried to draw a contrast between Indivisible’s protesters and the tea party, saying Indivisible’s activists were "very well-financed, very well-organized" and were "being bused around to go to these different town halls to disrupt them." That was news to the leaders of Indivisible, who have said they only tried to provide resources — how to found an activist group, how to reach members of Congress, how to hold meetings and form talking points, etc. — to groups unhappy with leaders in their districts. "It’s easier to say all these protests are paid than to admit there are wide swaths of people in your district who disagree with how they are represented in Congress," Sarah Dohl, a spokeswoman for Indivisible told PolitiFact. Dohl said there were only a handful of people behind Indivisible, which offers a website that has registered more than 5,300 different activist groups in order to help them organize. The group was conceived over Thanksgiving 2016, she said, actually drawing from some tea party principles (keeping groups relatively small and committed to local issues, for example). While they have received some donations, none of the board members draw a salary. Most of the people Indivisible helps have not been politically active before, Dohl said, but President Donald Trump’s election had sparked them into action. One such protester is Caitlynn Moses, a 23-year-old from Fayetteville, Ark. She told us she had never gotten involved in politics, but helped organize her group Ozark Indivisible to convince Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to hold a town hall meeting in Springdale on Feb. 22. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., faced a large crowd at a meeting in Springdale, Ark. Cotton acknowledged the paid protester controversy at the meeting, which Moses said attracted more than 2,000 people. "I don't care if anybody here is paid or not," Cotton said. "You're all Arkansans and I'm glad to hear from you." Moses was glad Cotton was willing to come out, although she laughs at the idea that her group — or anyone other activist — is paid to attend forums. "I would say the majority of us are losing money to do this," she said. "It's so important for us to stand up for what we believe that we are willing to sacrifice for it. The rumor that we're paid protestors is absolutely despicable. It's just something someone came up with so they could write us off." The backlash against protests has roots in the current White House, which has questioned their legitimacy since before Trump took office. Press secretary Sean Spicer said on Feb. 22 that he thought "some people are clearly upset, but there is a bit of professional protester manufactured base in there." This after Spicer earlier this month on Fox News accused protesters opposing Trump’s executive order on immigration of being "a very paid, ‘AstroTurf’ type movement." Nothing new If that term sounds familiar, it’s because liberal pundits and politicians used it to describe the tea party in 2009. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said in April 2009 that "the tea parties don’t represent a spontaneous outpouring of public sentiment. They’re AstroTurf (fake grassroots) events, manufactured by the usual suspects." Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also used the term, saying of the tea party a few days later: "This initiative is funded by the high end; we call it AstroTurf, it's not really a grassroots movement. It's AstroTurf by some of the wealthiest people in America to keep the focus on tax cuts for the rich instead of for the great middle class." Trump addressed the protests last week, tweeting, "The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That echoes a common fallback position for politicians who can’t prove that protesters are paid, University of California-Irvine sociology and political science professor David Meyer told us. "It's a little interesting that some of the Republican targets, unable to substantiate the paid professionals charge, retreat to making the claim that the protesters are organized," said Meyer, who wrote the book The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. "Of course they are. Someone distributed information about the time and place of each town meeting and encouraged people to show up and ask tough questions. That's how politics works." Meyer has looked into several activist groups, with no evidence yet of protesters being paid. The closest some aides have come is suggesting that Planned Parenthood, with its paid staff, have supported activist meetings, he said. Trump has been suspicious of protesters since the campaign trail, when he accused Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama of paying people to incite violence at rallies, without ever providing proof. The Internet also has spread unproven or outright faked claims that protesters raked in thousands of dollars or that George Soros paid Women’s March participants. Soros has denied such reports; his foundation has recently denied paying town hall protesters. Town hall attendees have taken to holding up their drivers licenses and signs with their ZIP codes in order to prove that they live in the districts in which they are protesting. "Not a single member has challenged the authenticity of a town hall questioner to their face," said Nathan Williams, a spokesman for volunteer-based forum organizers the Town Hall Project. "Because they all know these claims of ‘paid protesters’ are ridiculous." Williams said the Town Hall Project has no paid employees, even its full-time staff. Our ruling Gohmert said political activists are "being paid" to protest members of Congress. His office didn’t provide any evidence of this, and neither did several other Republican officials we asked. It’s possible some protesters somewhere may be paid, but there’s zero evidence of a wide-ranging conspiracy to bring in paid activists to disrupt meetings. We rate this statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a6193c51-8464-41e6-be3a-6f31d4804f51	None	Louie Gohmert	None	None	None	2017-02-27T16:33:44	2017-02-21	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-04972	Gov. Bill Haslam is "making our Economic Development department Sharia compliant" by hiring a woman "who specializes in Sharia compliance. That’s what her job is."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/jul/24/woody-degan/candidate-vanderbilt-state-sharia/	Woody Degan, an East Shelby businessman challenging state Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, in the Republican primary in District 32, is making several bold claims in his campaign. In an interview with The Commercial Appeal, he claimed there is an effort under way to make the state’s economic development agency "Sharia compliant." He contends that Gov. Bill Haslam has appointed a director at the state Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) who Degan says specializes in "Sharia compliance" and is working to make the agency "Sharia compliant" in order to "go after Sharia money." Here is but one of the full from Degan: "They’re making our Economic Development department Sharia compliant. They hired Samar Ali, who came directly from the Obama administration, who specializes in Sharia compliance. That’s what her job is." Degan repeated those charges at a candidate forum in Shelby County on Sunday, July 22, specifying again that the official in question is Samar Ali, ECD’s director of international development. Degan is not the only person attacking Ali -- eight county-level Republican committees have passed resolutions denouncing the governor’s appointment and demanding that Ali be fired, which Haslam has refused to do. So we decided to look into the matter. At its simplest, Sharia law is the moral code and religious law of the Islamic faith, addressing a variety of personal and secular topics. Aspects of Sharia law do govern business dealings, and some Muslims conduct business only under Sharia-compliant conditions. For example, Sharia may prohibit interest on loans, considering it usury, but may allow other lending fees in lieu of interest. Some people believe that Muslims are trying to incorporate Sharia law in the United States. In his attack on ECD and Samar Ali, Degan is echoing those groups that have attacked the governor’s appointment, largely because Ali is Muslim. She was a White House Fellow in 2010-11 and her resume includes work as a lawyer in a U.S. law firm’s Abu Dhabi office that involved Sharia-compliant business transactions – which is routine in many Middle Eastern countries. Degan spent eight minutes, in a 42-minute recorded interview, talking about Sharia and Ali. Among his assertions: --"Our governor several weeks ago appointed Samar Ali straight from the Obama administration to the top position in the Tennessee economic development department . . . so we’re preparing our state for Sharia money to come in." --"By Sharia law, 20 percent of all proceeds from their profits have to go to their mosques, many of which support jihad . . . We’re going to let them bring it into Tennessee and let those proceeds go back to kill our boys." --"They’re making our economic development department Sharia compliant. Why would you make it Sharia compliant if you weren’t going after Sharia money?" Degan’s most specific allegation regarding Ali is that she "specializes in Sharia compliance, financial compliance. That’s what her job is . . . and that’s what she was brought into Tennessee for." Clint Brewer, ECD’s assistant commissioner for communications, wrote in an email that Degan’s assertions are false. "Samar Ali was hired to be ECD’s international director. Her job duties are to manage the TNTrade export program and to supervise our four international offices in Germany, Japan, China and Canada." He added: "There is no part of her job -- or any department operations -- that involves Shariah compliant finance or Shariah law." Brewer also said there is no such effort under way, or planned, to make the agency Sharia compliant. "None whatsoever nor will there be any," he said. Ali was born in Nashville and raised in Waverly, Tenn., the daughter of two medical doctors who emigrated from the Middle East when they were young. She is a graduate of Vanderbilt University and its law school. An article on the Vanderbilt Law School website in 2010 summarized her accomplishments when she was selected as one of 13 members of the 2010-11 class of the prestigious White House Fellow program: "During her freshman year, she co-founded the Middle Eastern Students Association and began her three-year involvement with Vanderbilt’s Student Government Association by joining the multicultural committee and the SGA Future Leaders Program. Just two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Ali rose to an unofficial leadership position by speaking publicly about her Muslim faith and her religion's condemnation of the perpetrators' action. She was the university’s first Arab-Muslim student body president." Mike Newton, a Vanderbilt professor who supervised a project Ali completed on comparative human rights in Islamic societies, was quoted in the article that, "Samar was an amazingly well-rounded and poised student who added a very valuable perspective to our student body and to the International Law Practice Lab." When asked what evidence he had to back up his assertions about Sharia law at ECD, Degan said, "Her specialty is Sharia law and when she was put into that position as a Sharia law expert, it certainly raises questions and concerns about it. The evidence is in what she does…. I’m concerned, yes. Do I have evidence? No." Degan later emailed us a more elaborate response that included several attachments from the far-right blogosphere in opposition to Ali’s appointment. He wrote, "Evidence? Well, I agree, not until it starts happening is there actual concrete evidence." Our ruling A candidate in the Republican primary for state Senate made strong charges aimed at the state’s economic development department, saying that it had hired a woman specializing in Sharia law in order to make the department Sharia compliant. But even Degan admits he has no evidence. The department itself strongly denies the allegations and says Ali will have no involvement in Sharia compliance or Sharia transactions. Whether some like Degan in the Republican party feel it is necessary to attack the governor’s office for hiring a Muslim is up to them, but for making a claim that lacks evidence, we rate Degan’s statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-08457	New Castle County's unemployment rate has not almost doubled in the last two years.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/14/chris-coons/debate-chris-coons-says-christine-odonnell-wrong-c/	In the Sept. 13, 2010, Delaware Senate debate between Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Christine O'Donnell, the candidates split in he-said, she-said fashion over an unemployment statistic. O'Donnell kicked it off by charging that "unemployment here in New Castle County rose, almost doubled in the last two years under (Coons') watch as New Castle County executive." A moment later, Coons countered, "I also frankly can't imagine where she found the numbers that unemployment doubled in just the past year under my watch. I suspect we're going to need to keep a close eye this evening on the numbers that go flying back and forth." One of the moderators, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, interjected, "Let's ask her. Where did you get those numbers?" O'Donnell responded, "The Department of Labor statistics. And we'll have them on our web site by tomorrow." Sounds like a dispute tailor-made for PolitiFact: How much did unemployment rise in New Castle County, the most populous of Delaware's three counties? Lets first clarify a few matters. In Coons' reply, he misstated the time frame O'Donnell had used, saying it was one year when in fact she had said she was looking at the past two years. We'll analyze the question using O'Donnell's criteria -- two years -- while noting that Coons garbled O'Donnell's time frame. We also won't get into the question of whether a county executive deserves direct blame for rising unemployment, even though one can argue that unemployment is more sensitive to national and international economic factors than local ones. For our answer, we turned to the Local Area Unemployment Statistics database at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the U.S. Labor Department. In the most recent available month, August 2010, New Castle County, Del., registered an 8.7 percent unemployment rate. Two years before, in August 2008, the rate was 5.5 percent. (The figures are not seasonally adjusted, but since we're comparing August of one year to August of another, making seasonal adjustments should be irrelevant in this comparison.) That's a difference of 3.3 percentage points, or an increase of 58 percent over the August 2008 unemployment rate of 5.5 percent. If the rate had doubled as O'Donnell said, it would have needed to increase by 100 percent, which would have brought the unemployment rate to 11 percent today. And it clearly isn't that high. O'Donnell did give herself some breathing room by saying that the rate "almost" doubled over the past two years. But while it's possible to argue that 58 percent should be rounded up to 100 percent (or "double"), we think that's a stretch. After we'd finished our research, we received a response from the O'Donnell campaign. A spokesman said that O'Donnell was actually referring to the rise in unemployment starting at the beginning of Coons' tenure as county executive. We confirmed with the New Castle County government that Coons, who was elected in November 2004, was inaugurated in January 2005. So we looked at the county unemployment rate for January 2005 and found that it was 4.7 percent. That did rate roughly double by August 2010 -- but that's a period of five and a half years, not two, as O'Donnell had said in the debate. Using that time frame also measures unemployment from a point well before the economy slid into recession to a point of stubbornly high unemployment rates everywhere, so it would hardly be surprising to find the numbers rise. As it happened, New Castle County performed better than the nation as a whole at each of these three points in time. The county's 4.7 percent unemployment rate in January 2005 was lower than the national 5.3 percent rate that month. The 5.5 percent unemployment rate in August 2008 was lower than the national rate of 6.2 percent that month, and the county's 8.7 percent in August 2010 was lower than the national rate of 9.6 percent. In fact, unemployment grew slightly more slowly in New Castle County over that period than it did nationally. So where does this leave us? While O'Donnell is correct that unemployment has risen in New Castle County, as it has everywhere, the increase wasn't almost double over two years -- the period she said during the debate. By saying that she meant to measure it from the beginning of Coons' term as county executive, her campaign team is essentially conceding that she got the fact wrong. In our role as debate referee, we give Coons' stance that O'Donnell erred a rating of True.	None	Chris Coons	None	None	None	2010-10-14T18:04:10	2010-10-13	['None']
pomt-08994	"Gov. Crist has never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/14/charlie-crist/crist-stands-firm-gun-rights/	Charlie Crist and "never wavered" are words that don't seem to naturally fit together these days. He vetoed anti-abortion legislation in June 2010 after painting himself as fiercely pro-life. He buddied up to Sarah Palin during a "Drill, Baby, Drill" event in 2008, then called for a special legislative session to ban oil drilling in July 2010. Most famously, he abandoned the Republican party after pegging himself as a both a Jeb Bush and Ronald Reagan Republican throughout his political career. Yet Crist, who has been known to attribute his political flexibility to his desire to serve "the people," claims there is one issue where voters can trust him to never waffle. "Gov. Crist has never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms," reads the Crist for U.S. Senate campaign website. Given Crist's serial elasticity, we wondered if this could be true. Does the so-called People's Governor actually have steady convictions about, well, something? Crist, a St. Petersburg lawyer who was first elected to public office in 1992, quickly earned a reputation as a pro-gun candidate. In his steady rise through Florida's political strata, he continued to cultivate that image, consistently siding with gun owners. In one of his first high-profile gun battles, Crist blasted then Gov. Lawton Chiles' last-minute effort to require criminal background checks and a waiting period for purchases made at gun shows in 1998. "Unfortunately we're in a state that's No. 1 in violent crime in America,'' said Crist, then a state Senator. "And for us to make moves that would disarm our law-abiding citizens would be inappropriate." The proposed legislation died in committee. As Attorney General, Crist nominated former NRA President Marion P. Hammer to the state's Women's Hall of Fame. She was inducted in December 2004. In his 2006 primary against Republican rival Tom Gallagher, who supported some gun-control restrictions, Crist put out an ad that called Gallagher "anti-gun." The ad concluded, "Charlie Crist: endorsed by the NRA." After he won, Crist continued to highlight his Second Amendment views to trump Jim Davis, his Democratic opponent in the general election. As governor, he appointed NRA favorites Chief Justice Charles T. Canady and Justice Ricky Polston to the Florida Supreme Court. He signed into law legislation that allowed 500,000 concealed weapons permit-holders to bring their guns to work -- as long as the weapons remained in their vehicles. He vetoed a move by lawmakers to take $6 million out of the trust fund that pays for licensing gun owners and processing concealed weapons permits. The national Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms rewarded his efforts by bestowing him the title of "Gun Rights Defender of the Month" in July 2009. Crist then signed a bill that granted protected status to Florida's concealed weapons permit trust fund, shielding it from future raids by a cash-strapped Legislature, in a ceremony in April 2010, during which he wrapped his arms around Hammer, now the NRA's lobbyist, for a public embrace. Most recently, Crist's campaign celebrated the Second Amendment in a Twitter message. "Pleased w the US Supreme Court's decision today reaffirming our 2nd Amendment rights," he tweeted on June 28, hours after the court ruled the Second Amendment gives all Americans a right to keep and bear arms for self-defense that trumps state and local laws. In fact, PolitiFact had a hard time finding any instance where Crist refused to back gun rights. We scanned roughly 1,000 news articles that mentioned Crist and the words "bear arms," "Second Amendment," and "gun restrictions." The only hints we found that Crist wasn't entirely beholden to unrestricted gun rights could barely be described as so much as a flutter of indecision. In 1993, Crist told the St. Petersburg Times he was considering supporting several proposed bills that would impose tougher penalties on youths who use guns while committing a crime. "I believe very strongly in the right to bear arms, but I don't see a need for kids to bear arms," except for hunting or target shooting with supervision, said Crist, newly elected to the state Senate. The NRA gave some of the proposed bills its blessing. In another instance, Crist bucked the NRA when he appointed Justice James Perry, a self-professed gun advocate who never convinced the NRA of his loyalty, to the Florida Supreme Court in 2009. But gun leaders say the appointment was an unnoteworthy misfire. They did not hold it against Crist. "He has always throughout his career been a strong advocate for the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen, never voted against us, always voted with us as governor," Hammer said. "He signed every piece of legislation gun owners asked him to sign and vetoed every piece of legislation negatively impacting gun owners and sportsman that gun owners asked him to veto. He has an outstanding record of support." Hammer said Crist earned an "A" rating as a political newcomer, the highest grade bestowed to a rookie candidate by the NRA, and subsequently received an "A+" in future years based on his voting record. "You can't get an 'A+' unless you have a strong history on our issues," Hammer said. Joe Waldron, director of the Citizens Committee to Keep and Bear Arms, also said that Crist's support for gun rights has remained steadfast. However, a budding effort to cast doubt on Crist's pro-gun record has begun to emerge. Crist recently indicated he would confirm President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan, if elected to the U.S. Senate, drawing mixed responses. Hammer said she continues to trust Crist. Neither Hammer or the NRA has endorsed a candidate in the Senate race yet. "I was told he had a made a comment about Kagan before he knew her record and before he knew of our opposition," she said. "We would not be pleased with anyone who would vote to confirm Elena Kagan. We have made that very clear." The Florida Republican Party used the statement in another round of attacks against its former leader. "Floridians believe in the Second Amendment, and we need a United States senator who will defend that right when given the responsibility of confirming justices who could influence the rulings of the Supreme Court for generations," Chairman John Thrasher said in a June 2010 press release. "The reality here is about more than politics. If activist judges like Elena Kagan gain control of the Supreme Court, our individual right to bear arms for personal protection could cease to exist in this country. Does Charlie Crist still think she’d do a great job?" Republican spokesman Katie Betta elaborated in an email interview: "Our main point with this release was to highlight the fact that when the Governor was trying to win the Republican Primary, he opposed the confirmation on Justice Sotomayor because of her record on the Second Amendment, now he said he thinks Kagan will do a great job, despite the fact that she has such a controversial record on the Second Amendment. His position is ever-changing in that it changes based on his political needs, rather than based on principles." To be sure, Crist is no Charlton Heston. He isn't even a Palin, for that matter. He doesn't stalk across the state clutching a rifle or claim to kill his own dinner. But his standing with the NRA is bulletproof, at least for the time being. We rate this True.

pomt-08284	Says "6 percent more Republicans across the state voted than Democrats."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/06/bob-tiernan/party-chair-bob-tiernan-says-oregons-republicans-o/	Thursday morning was a rough one for Bob Tiernan. Just before Democrat John Kitzhaber accepted the governorship, the chairman of Oregon’s Republican Party had to bat away suggestions that the state GOP was in need of a major makeover. Tiernan was a guest on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s Think Out Loud Thursday morning, and host Emily Harris asked him what was next for the party. "If Chris Dudley had won, there was a lot of talk that he would be the leader of rebuilding the Oregon Republican Party," she said. She then went on to mention the fact that all statewide offices belong to Democrats and that Republicans had been having a difficult time finding candidates for some races. How, Harris asked, would Dudley’s loss affect all that? "First off, the Republican Party is quite strong in this state. I think you can look at our statistics from this last election," Tiernan said. "We outperformed Democrats. ... Six percent more Republicans across the state voted than Democrats." We wondered whether he had that right. If you take the statement at face value, it sounds as though you had more Republicans than Democrats voting. Thankfully, the Oregon Secretary of State tracks all these numbers. As of 8:30 Thursday morning, the Secretary of State was reporting that roughly 644,000 Democrats and 526,000 Republicans voted out of a total of 1,479,188 for all ballots returned. That means Democrats accounted for about 44 percent of returned ballots and Republicans for about 36 percent. That gives the edge to Democrats. But there’s another way to look at these numbers. While more Democrats than Republicans voted, there are far more Oregon voters registered as Democrats than as Republicans. If you take that into account, the numbers show that 79 percent of all Republicans had turned out to vote while 74.5 of all Democrats had. That is indeed a difference of 6 percent. We spoke with Greg Leo, the spokesman for the Oregon Republican Party, and he told us that Tiernan was referring to the return rates within each party, not overall. So, back to the ruling. Tiernan is right, the Republicans did have a stronger turnout if you’re talking party proportions. But he didn’t make it exactly clear what he meant in his guest spot on "Think Out Loud," and certainly listeners could have come away a bit confused, thinking more Republicans had voted than Democrats. So, we’ll split the difference and call this one Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-06759	Says Gov. Rick Scott cut state funding for PBS.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/22/florida-voter/caller-says-gov-rick-scott-cut-funding-pbs/	When the progressive group Pink Slip Rick urged Florida voters to call Gov. Rick Scott, Floridians sounded off about layoffs of government workers, the state of public education and the governor's own wealth. But one caller was tuned in to another issue: public television. On Aug. 17, 2011, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow played some of Floridians' robocalls that are posted on Pink Slip Rick's website, including a call from Chris S: "I really can't believe that you cut PBS of all things. My kids sit around and watch PBS in the early morning. They learn so much from it. And to have the state cut funding for PBS is despicable." Did the jobs governor give Cookie Monster the pink slip? (In a related Truth-O-Meter item we rate a claim made by Debra B., who said Scott spent taxpayer dollars to robocall Floridians.) Scott's veto On May 26, 2011, Scott announced more than $600 million in budget vetoes including $4,799,110 for public radio and television. (That veto included money for WLRN, a public radio station affiliated with the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner.) The veto meant that the 13 public radio stations each lost about $62,000 and the 13 public TV stations each lost about $307,000 (the impact on the stations varied depending on their total budget). These public stations are generally funded by state and federal dollars as well as membership donations and corporate support. One piece of public programming was spared Scott's budget ax. WFSU in Tallahassee has a contract for The Florida Channel, which covers the state legislative session and public hearings about redistricting. WFSU lost money along with the rest of the stations but production money for The Florida Channel was not cut, said Janyth Righter, executive director of Florida Public Broadcasting Service Inc. After his vetoes, Scott launched robocalls to highlight the cuts. A progressive group, Pink Slip Rick, invited Floridians to robocall Scott back. The Pink Slip Rick campaign is sponsored by Florida Watch Action, a progressive group. The executive director of Florida Watch Action is Susannah Randolph, wife of state Rep. Scott Randolph, D-Orlando, and former campaign manager to former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson. Impact of the cut In Florida, public radio stations reach 1.3 million listeners weekly, covering local news and airing NPR programs such as Morning Edition, All Things Considered and Car Talk. The TV stations, which reach 11 million viewers weekly, also include local content such as town hall meetings and national PBS programs about news, history and culture. The TV stations also buy and air PBS programs that teach children about the alphabet, reading, vocabulary, math and science among other shows including Sesame Street, Clifford the Big Red Dog, It's a Big World and Curious George. Florida's PBS stations also provide workshops for teachers with a focus on at-risk and low-income families and provide books to Florida's neediest children. The impact of the veto isn't fully known yet, said Righter, executive director of the Florida Public Broadcasting Service, which represents all of the stations. "People are going to be laid off and have been," she said. "Stations are still trying to come up with how to fund some of these things." But Righter said she doesn't expect that the TV stations will drop children's programs such as Sesame Street. "The way the programs are packaged, we really won't lose our kids programs unless something else happens that creates a big drop in revenue," she said. "We have a big commitment to that childrens block. We plan to continue that." It's the face-to-face outreach with people in the school districts that may not continue, she said. The TV stations have educators who go into schools to provide workshops for teachers to show them how to use PBS programs to help children engage in reading. The cuts will also probably impact local program production, Righter said. John Labonia, general manager at WLRN in Miami, said the veto won't affect children's programming at his station. "Stations pay PBS for the rights to carry those programs. In our case we didn't use any of the state money to purchase programs," he said. Our ruling When Pink Slip Rick put out the call to robocall Gov. Scott, Chris S. was among the callers. He said to Scott: "I really can't believe that you cut PBS of all things. My kids sit around and watch PBS in the early morning. They learn so much from it. And to have the state cut funding for PBS is despicable." The caller is right that Scott vetoed $4.8 million in state funding for public radio and TV, but the particular impact the caller cites -- cuts to children's programs -- are not expected. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Florida voter	None	None	None	2011-08-22T16:08:42	2011-08-17	['None']
pomt-06118	"The latest unemployment numbers have shown that nearly 315,000 Americans have simply given up hope when it comes to finding a job."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/30/paul-broun/broun-315000-americans-gave-looking-work/	Want to make voters pay attention? Use the word "jobs." The national unemployment rate may be down, but the economy’s still in a jobs funk. Congress is under pressure from virtually all sides to pass legislation that encourages job creation, or at least saves jobs. So when U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, R-Athens, used the "J" word in a recent press release over the payroll tax debate, the eyes of your PolitiFact Georgia scribes were glued to our computer screens. "The latest unemployment numbers have shown that nearly 315,000 Americans have simply given up hope when it comes to finding a job," the Athens Republican’s release said. "Our economy is barely hanging on as it is, and we cannot risk losing more of our working class to job-killing tax increases." Nearly 315,000 Americans have given up on finding work? The government tracks all sorts of jobs figures, but who keeps tabs on hopelessness? Broun used this statistic days earlier. When the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Department of Labor’s official keeper of the nation’s jobs data, released its November employment figures Dec. 2, he issued a press release criticizing the Obama administration. "Today’s job report paints a clear picture of how thoroughly this Administration’s policies have failed," Broun’s release said. "While the addition of 120,000 net jobs appears to be good news, what it hides is that 315,000 Americans have now simply given up looking for work, and are no longer counted in these unemployment figures." We called Broun’s office for more information, but received no response during the winter break. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We discovered that our federal government does track people who despair of finding a job. Each month, the bureau publishes a report with key labor data such as unemployment figures and the size of the workforce. It also includes a monthly count of what the bureau classifies as "discouraged workers." These are people who want to find a job and are available to take one, but have given up because they think there are no jobs, or none for which they would qualify. We looked at data for November 2011, the most recent numbers available when Broun issued his press release. They show that there were fewer discouraged workers than the year before, but their ranks had grown from the previous month. There were some 1.1 million discouraged workers in November, which was down by about 186,000 from a year earlier and up about 133,000 from a month earlier. Whether you consider discouraged workers on a year-to-year or month-to-month basis, Broun’s figure is way off the mark. Since Broun wasn’t available for a response, we searched the Internet for possible sources of his data. We found an Associated Press story that said that "a key reason the unemployment rate fell so much was because roughly 315,000 people had given up looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed." USA Today, National Public Radio and other news outlets posted the story or excerpts on their web sites. We found that the size of the civilian labor force, or the number of employed and unemployed non-military workers, did shrink by 315,000 people, according to the BLS data. But this does not mean that they dropped out of the job market because they thought they couldn’t find work, explained Gary Steinberg, a spokesman for the bureau. Some might have left the labor force to care for a sick relative. Others might have retired. Or the working-age population might have decreased. Broun was apparently led astray by credible news outlets, but the figure is still wrong. November’s unemployment numbers did not show that "nearly 315,000 Americans have simply given up hope when it comes to finding a job." The ranks of discouraged workers had actually declined by about 186,000 since November 2010, and risen by about 133,000 since October. This means he’s off by hundreds of thousands of workers, no matter how you count it. Broun earns a False.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2011-12-30T06:00:00	2011-12-13	['United_States']
pomt-14305	"It was (Rob Portman’s) job to stop China’s illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing."	false	/ohio/statements/2016/apr/01/ted-strickland/anti-rob-portman-ad-relies-public-ignorance-trade-/	Ted Strickland goes back 11 years in an ad targeting incumbent Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, chastising his role as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush. "It was his job to stop China’s illegal dumping of steel," the narrator says. "He failed, looked the other way, did nothing." Titled "Beltway Rob," the ad is part of an ongoing name-calling battle between the Strickland and Portman campaigns. (Portman mocks Strickland as "Retread Ted.") Strickland’s ad left us wondering if Portman dropped the ball on foreign steel during his year as trade representative. ("Dumping" in trade speak typically refers to a country introducing a cheaper-than-normal product into a foreign market and edging out domestic manufacturers.) Was it really his job to stop China’s illegal steel dumping, and did Portman really do nothing to stand up for the United States? Strickland’s campaign pointed us to a 2012 Politico article about potential running mates for Mitt Romney’s presidential bid. Portman’s name was on the short list, the article said, but a chapter in Portman’s trade history could be leveraged as a weakness by Democratic opponents. We turned to the trade wonks for more clarity. Role of trade representative So was it Portman’s job to "stop China's illegal dumping of steel?" In a word, no. "Like a lot of political ads, it’s more complicated than the ad is saying," said Warren Maruyama, who served as general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under Portman’s successor, Susan Schwab. The trade representative’s job is to act as the government’s spokesperson on trade, negotiate trade agreements, file cases with the World Trade Organization on behalf of domestic interests and defend against cases where those interests are challenged, and to oversee coordination with the alphabet soup of other agencies whose interests overlap with trade, Maruyama said. Trade law is arcane, and it’s easier to yell "China bad!" than it is to explain its nuances. But to a trade expert’s ear, it makes no sense to say that Portman failed to stop illegal Chinese dumping. It’s like saying LeBron James failed to score any touchdowns last season — that's the wrong sport. Likewise, the law is very clear that the U.S. trade representative has no role in the determinations on unfair trade practices such as dumping. Determinations regarding dumping are made by the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Court, in procedures which are deliberately shielded from political or outside interference. "It’s walled off from political considerations, and Portman could have gotten into trouble if he’d tried to interfere," Maruyama said. If dumping is proven, it’s an unfair trade practice for which relief is mandatory. The U.S. International Trade Commission decides if there is injury or the threat of injury, and the Commerce Department determines the appropriate relief, through higher tariffs. Alan Wolff, who was deputy special representative for trade negotiations during President Jimmy Carter’s administration, agreed. "Portman had no role on anti-dumping," he said. "That’s flat-out wrong." The attack ad copy is conflating two different issues, Wolff said. The case referenced by Politico, the one that the Strickland ad wants to use as proof of Portman’s inaction on Chinese dumping, didn’t involve market-dumping at all. The case at hand is different In August 2005, American makers of circular welded non-alloy steel pipe, which is often used in home-building, filed for relief from "market disruption" under Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974. Market disruption is not the same as dumping. Trade experts draw a firm distinction between the two terms. (When the Wall Street Journal mischaracterized a similar 2009 market disruption case as a dumping case, the paper ran a correction.) "There is a clear difference," Maruyama said. "The thing about ‘dumping’ is it sounds bad, so people throw it around, but it’s just not accurate." Section 421 is "a unique and rarely used statute," according to Schwab, who took over for Portman after Bush tapped him to head the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Cases under this statute for market disruption fall under a category of "safeguard" considerations, where it is not necessary for the petitioner to prove wrongdoing, only that a trade action has caused them "injury, or threat of injury." It’s "a way of bypassing a formal dumping hearing by the trade commission," Schwab said. Section 421 cases are also unique in that they require approval from the White House. The president, the law says, must determine whether trade relief measures are in the country’s economic interest, "or could threaten national security." In October 2005, the International Trade Commission issued its determination on the steel pipe case. Four of six trade commissioners sided with the steel pipe manufacturers and recommended tariffs and safeguard actions be imposed on China’s pipe imports. Two commissioners dissented, finding no market disruption. Here, it was Portman’s job to coordinate the process where representatives from other agencies weigh in. "They all sit down and argue," Maruyama said, "and if they have a consensus, that’s the recommendation that goes up to the president. If there are differences, and often there are, it goes over to the White House in a memo summarizing all the pros and cons. And then Bush gets to decide." Portman had a Cabinet role in this occasion, but Schwab said Bush was very clear that there was only one "decider" in his administration. "It wasn’t a Portman-Bush decision," she said. "It was a Bush decision." Bush did not impose relief in this case, or in three other 421 cases that crossed his desk when Portman wasn’t his trade representative. In the steel pipe case, Bush said that relief wasn’t in the national economic interest. He believed that punishing China on steel pipe wouldn’t ultimately help U.S. steel manufacturers. "There are many other countries currently supplying standard pipe to the U.S. market that could fill the void created by curtailed Chinese imports," wrote Portman in a February 2006 letter to Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., one of many lawmakers catching heat from angry steel industry constituents. Schwab called attacks on Portman’s record on China "ironic." "Portman was always my strongest ally when I wanted to take the Chinese to the WTO," she said. "He was a hawk on these issues. If I wanted to file trade enforcement cases on China I could always count on him." Our ruling Strickland’s ad says that it was Portman’s "job to stop China’s illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing." We consulted trade experts on both sides of the partisan aisle. They were unanimous that the ad’s statement is fundamentally wrong. Portman did not have a role to play in anti-dumping measures as U.S. trade representative. The 2005 trade matter that the ad attacks him over had nothing to do with dumping. This case only reached Portman, and ultimately Bush, because it was filed under another part of trade law that triggers presidential involvement that isn't used for true "dumping" cases. And if you switched "Bush" for "Portman" in this ad, it would still be a cynical twisting of words. "Dumping" is not a catch-all for Chinese steel in the market.

pomt-08365	Since Rep. John Boccieri’s election, "Ohio has lost 600,000 jobs" and his district’s "unemployment has doubled."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/26/jim-renacci/gop-challenger-jim-renacci-joins-chorus-job-losses/	Once more, with spirit: Ohio has lost a whole lot of jobs. It’s the chorus line of 2010, and if the Capital Steps were in Ohio they would sing it as an encore. Imagine our surprise, then, when we heard a sonorous new version last week from congressional candidate and businessman Jim Renacci. The Wadsworth Republican, running against Democratic incumbent John Boccieri, said in opening remarks of a debate in Canton: "Ladies and gentlemen, our country is going in the wrong direction. What we’ve learned is that over the last couple of years, Ohio has lost over 600,000 jobs." He added that "Since Mr. Boccieri has become a representative of the 16th District, unemployment has doubled." That figure – 600,000 – is roughly double to triple the number that others have cited as they challenge Ohio Democrats holding office. The sums change depending on the month and year, but Renacci’s figure seemed outlandishly high to our numerically attuned ears. That’s because it is. Using figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that from January 2009, when Boccieri took office, through August 2010, the most recent month counted when Renacci made his claim, Ohio lost 176,400 jobs. New data that included September came out after the debate, and if counted it would put Ohio’s job losses during the current Congress at 194,300. It would be impossible for Renacci’s number to be correct no matter how you measured "the last two years," unless BLS data – the gold standard for statisticians -- was off by 300-plus percent. Perplexed, we asked Renacci’s spokesman, James Slepian, how his boss got his number. Slepian responded that while Renacci said the state has lost 600,000 jobs over the last couple of years, his number was actually in reference to Ohio’s unemployment rate, not its job losses. Stick with us here, because this is a distinction with a definite difference. The unemployment rate measures the number and percentage of people at any given time who say they are out of work and are actively looking for a job. It doesn’t matter when they lost their jobs. That’s different – and typically much higher -- from the number of jobs lost during a specific period, which is measured in a survey of employers. If you counted every Ohioan looking for work, regardless of when he or she lost a job, the number would come to 601,145 as of August, which again was the most current number during the debate. It’s now come down a tad, to 590,809, BLS databases show.. That’s a lot of unemployed people, to be sure. But most of them were already out of work when Boccieri became a congressman. In fact, the number in Ohio was already 515,292 when Boccieri took his oath of office. So while the trend continued while Boccieri has been in office, the magnitude is not the result of the last couple of years, as Renacci said, and in fact has shown a small reversal in recent months. This brings us to Renacci’s related point – that since Boccieri "became a representative" of the 16th Congressional District, "unemployment has doubled." No, it hasn’t. This, too, can be measured a number of ways, and we tried a bunch. We started by looking at the Canton-Massillon metropolitan statistical area since that’s the heart of the district’s population center. The current rate of unemployment there is 10.6 percent. The number is nothing to cheer. But the rate was 10.2 when Boccieri took office, which is not even close to the doubling that Renacci claimed. We asked Slepian to explain how his boss arrived at this claim, too. Slepian said that Renacci was not using just the Canton metro area but, rather, the four-county area that makes up his district: Stark, Wayne, Ashland and Medina counties. With Slepian on the phone, we joined him in going over the numbers as we turned our respective cursors to the BLS databases. He noted accurately that in Stark County, the unemployment rate just before Boccieri’s election, in October 2008, was 6.8 percent. And in January 2010, it reached 13.6 percent, which is exactly double. Two problems. First, Boccieri was sworn in in January, 2009, and Stark County’s unemployment rate was already 10.0 by then. Second, Renacci seemed to stop flipping through the calendar awfully early to get to his claim. Had he counted every month that Boccieri has been in office, he would have stopped at August 2010, the most recent month for which there is countywide data, rather than stopping in January. Guess what? The unemployment rate for the most recent month available was 10.5 in Stark County, not 13.6. Things improved, it seems, when Renacci stopped counting. We did the same kinds of calculations for the district’s three other counties, and the result were similarly at odds with Renecci’s doubling claim. In fact, were he to measure Ashland County alone, he’d have to say that on Boccieri’s watch, the unemployment rate actually went down, from 12.2 at the start to 10.4 in August. This looked like a classic case of cherry picking the data to support a false claim, and we told Slepian as much. He maintained that statewide, the unemployment rate is higher than it was two years ago, and that no matter how you slice it, "there are 600,000 people out of work in the state." And he said that when looking at certain periods in the last two years – a month before Boccieri’s election (but three before his inauguration) and 12 months into his term -- "we did see it double" in the district’s biggest county. "It’s an accurate statement to say that that’s what it went up to since he was elected to office," Slepian said. Yes, it is, but only if you ignore the fact that it has come way down since Renacci stopped turning the calendar pages at exactly the right date to shore up his argument. To include months when an opponent wasn’t in office, and to stop counting when the unemployment numbers make your case, leaves out a massive amount of information and context. Did we mention that Renacci is a CPA? If we tried these tricks on our taxes, we could be treated to a heap of IRS trouble (although with a creative accountant, you never know). But the Truth-O-Meter does not assess tax penalties; it merely points its arrow to the only rating possible when a claim is inaccurate and its basis is distorted and contorted: Pants on Fire!

pomt-10324	"He made time to go to the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops. Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/29/john-mccain/damned-if-you-dont/	In an effort to shore up his foreign policy chops, Sen. Barack Obama took the unusual step of making a trip overseas — to the Middle East and Europe. The idea, in part, was to show the presidential candidate's gravitas as an international leader. But the strategy backfired a bit when Obama canceled plans to visit wounded troops at a military hospital in Germany. Obama had been part of a congressional delegation that visited Iraq and Afghanistan, but when that trip ended Obama stayed on the road, spending several days on a campaign-funded tour of Europe. Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, was supposed to be one of the stops. The decision to cancel was made after the Pentagon raised a number of issues about its policy against campaign activity at a military base — including visits by campaign staff or any media coverage or speeches. As a sitting senator, Obama was welcome to visit troops, but no one on the campaign trip with him, including a retired general who is advising his campaign, could go along. Obama found himself in an awkward spot: visit wounded troops alone and risk being seen as having used them as campaign props, or skip the wounded troops altogether. It was a no-win pickle of Obama's own making. He hoped to minimize the political controversy by backing out of the hospital visit. The McCain campaign quickly pounced. An ad released on July 26, 2008, implied Obama blew off the visit with wounded troops because he wasn't allowed to use it as a photo op. "He made time to go to the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops," an annoucer says. "Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras." That Obama visited a Berlin gym is not in dispute (though the McCain ad actually shows footage of Obama playing basketball with American troops at an airbase in Kuwait). Nor is it disputed that Obama canceled a scheduled visit with wounded troops. But the ad suggests Obama canceled the visit because he wasn't allowed to bring cameras. That's the part the Obama campaign vehemently denies. The Pentagon did raise questions about whether Obama's visit would amount to political activity, which is restricted at military installations. "Nobody denied Sen. Obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at Landstuhl. Obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and can certainly visit in an official capacity," said Bryan Whitman, spokesman for the Pentagon. "There are, as you know though, restrictions on what you can do as a candidate for political office, that stems from trying to maintain political neutrality and not have the military involved in politics." "Under no circumstances may a candidate make a campaign-related statement on an instillation," Whitman said. According to Department of Defense policy, "Any activity that may be reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associating the Department of Defense ... with a partisan political activity ... shall be avoided." Said Whitman: "The senator's staff was informed of the limits on what the military can do with respect to a political campaign and how we could support a senator's visit to Landstuhl, and quite frankly I expected them to have the visit." The Obama campaign apparently thought better of it. "Sen. Obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go,'' retired Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, a foreign policy adviser to Obama, stated in a release from the campaign. In addition to the ad, McCain took a swipe at Obama's decision during an appearance on the ABC News program This Week . "Well, I know this, that those troops would have loved to have seen him," McCain said. "And I know of no Pentagon regulation that would have prevented him from going there — without the media and the press and all of the associated people." "The important thing is that, if I had been told by the Pentagon that I couldn't visit those troops, and I was there and wanted to be there, I guarantee you, there would have been a seismic event." "I believe he had the opportunity to go without the media. And I'll let the facts speak for themselves." Obama campaign spokeswoman Linda Douglass told ABC News that Obama never intended for the visit to be a public event. "We told military officials explicitly that Sen. Obama had absolutely no intention of bringing any members of the media or photographers in with him to visit the wounded warriors," Douglass said. "In all of our communications with the military, we stressed that this was to be a private visit by Sen. Obama." In the past, Obama has met privately with wounded veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who accompanied Obama on part of his tour, said Obama met privately with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., also accompanied Obama as part of a congressional delegation on the official trip to Afghanistan and Iraq, but broke off when Obama parted with the delegation and embarked on a short European tour. "At that point, it was a political trip for Sen. Obama," Hagel said on CBS's Face the Nation. "I think it would have been inappropriate for him and certainly he would have been criticized by the McCain people and the press and probably should have been if on a political trip in Europe paid for by political funds — not the taxpayers — to go, essentially, then and be accused of using our wounded men and women as props for his campaign. ... I think it would be totally inappropriate for him on a campaign trip to go to a military hospital and use those soldiers as props. So I think he probably, based on what I know, he did the right thing." Hagel added that he did not think the McCain ad was appropriate. Here's what Obama said about it all: "The staff was working this so I don't know each and every detail but here is what I understand happened," Obama told ABC News. "We had scheduled to go, we had no problem at all in leaving, we always leave press and staff off — that is why we left it off the schedule. We were treating it in the same way we treat a visit to Walter Reed which I was able to do a few weeks ago without any fanfare whatsoever. I was going to be accompanied by one of my advisors, a former military officer (Gration). "And we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person, and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasn't on the Senate staff. That triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political. And the last thing that I want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns. "So rather than go forward and potentially get caught up in what might have been considered a political controversy of some sort," Obama said, "what we decided was that we not make a visit and instead I would call some of the troops that were there. So that essentially would be the extent of the story." In a briefing with reporters, Robert Gibbs, a senior communications adviser to the Obama campaign, said the trip had been planned weeks in advance, but the campaign believed "it could be done in a way that would not ... be ... seen as a campaign stop." Gibbs said the plan was to leave the media entourage on the plane while Obama made his visit. MSNBC reporter Andrea Mitchell, who was part of the traveling press corps, confirmed that in an on-air interview with Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. "The point is that Obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him," Mitchell said. "I was there. I can vouch for that." So where are we? The Obama campaign explanation seems plausible. There is no hard evidence from the McCain campaign that the loss of a photo op played any role in Obama's decision. There's ample evidence, though no documentation, that Obama never intended to bring press to the hospital. On the other hand, this is a problem of Obama's own creation. The fact remains he canceled the visit after the Pentagon voiced concern about political overtones. The fact remains, too, that Obama could have done a private visit even after the Pentagon raised its objections. Obama had done such visits before. We can't give McCain's campaign any points for accuracy here, but neither can we say Obama is a helpless victim of a baseless attack. To do that we would have to give Obama and his version of the campaign's plans every benefit of the doubt. That leads us to Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14142	Says Danny Tarkanian is "NRA ‘F’ Rated."	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/may/03/michael-roberson/ads-attacking-tarkanians-nra-grade-need-context/	Politicians on both sides often wear National Rifle Association grades as a badge of pride, but one Nevada Republican is fighting off claims that he received a failing grade from the gun advocacy group. Republican Danny Tarkanian, who’s running for Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, is the target of a series of Web ads promoted by his primary opponent, state Sen. Michael Roberson, attacking his alleged poor grades from the NRA. The ads implied that Tarkanian has a poor record on Second Amendment issues, with one claiming that he is "playing games with our gun rights." Only a handful of Nevada lawmakers have been the recipient of NRA F marks. We wanted to know if Tarkanian really received a failing grade, and if so, why. Failing grade NRA grades and endorsements are made by lobbyists and analysts who follow state and federal firearm issues, and are generally only supposed to represent a snapshot in time. "Candidate ratings for previous election cycles were compiled in the year of the election and may no longer accurately represent a candidate’s or elected official’s position or rating," the NRA’s website says. (The NRA did not return our requests for comment on this fact-check.) Tarkanian’s F grade came a decade ago, during his Tarkanian’s unsuccessful bid for Nevada secretary of state. But isn’t such a simple snapshot of his position on guns. During that 2006 race, the pro-gun control Brady Campaign for Gun Violence released a recorded robo-call supporting his candidacy. Tarkanian told PolitiFact that he doesn’t dispute the grade, but he never solicited the endorsement. "I didn’t know about it, and I didn’t ask for it," he said. "I have never in my life spoken to the Brady organization." The timeline on the grade is slightly murky. Tarkanian says he wasn’t involved, and the NRA’s former lobbyist covering Nevada, Carrie Herbertson, passed away in 2014. But former Brady Campaign president Paul Helmke said someone from the Tarkanian campaign solicited the endorsement, because the group doesn’t typically involve itself in down-ballot races. "There’s no way we would have been involved in (the) secretary of state race in Nevada unless somebody from the campaign got involved," he said. Dan Burdish, who served as an unpaid adviser to Tarkanian in 2006, said his memory was fuzzy but he believed the failing grade was due to confusion over some of the topics on the questionnaire. "It just got screwed up," he said. Burdish said Tarkanian’s mother, Las Vegas City Councilwoman Lois Tarkanian, contacted the Brady Campaign about endorsing him in the secretary of state race against eventual winner Ross Miller, who got an A from the NRA in 2006. Lois Tarkanian didn’t return multiple calls seeking comment. Second Amendment issues didn’t appear to play a major role in the race, as a cached version of Tarkanian’s 2006 campaign website doesn’t mention firearms and a pre-election preview in the Las Vegas Sun doesn’t mention guns. The F rating resurfaced during Tarkanian’s 2010 run for U.S. Senate, when his then-primary opponent Sue Lowden tried to revive it as a campaign issue. Tarkanian campaign manager James Fisfis told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2009 that earlier poor grades were the result of a "misunderstanding" with the surveys. Tarkanian didn’t fill out the questionnaire in 2004 during his run for state Senate, and he received a C+ during his 2012 bid for a U.S. House seat. There’s no record of a grade during his unsuccessful U.S. Senate primary bid in 2010. Nevada Firearms Coalition president Don Turner said his state-based group gave Tarkanian an A rating in 2014, but doesn’t plan to endorse in the current primary. Roberson has a consistent A from the NRA, receiving high marks during his 2010 and 2014 state Senate elections. Tarkanian has generally run on a pro-Second Amendment platform since 2010. He’s written multiple op-eds highly critical of an assault weapon ban and supported reciprocity for concealed weapon permits throughout different states. On his current campaign website, Tarkanian clearly states his firearm policy: "I oppose any and all efforts to register guns and their owners, and I oppose any and all efforts to restrict the sale or ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens." Our ruling A series of Web ads claim Tarkanian has an F rating from the NRA. Tarkanian did receive an F rating from the NRA in 2006, and he also received the blessing of the pro-gun control Brady Campaign. But NRA endorsements are intended to only last for one election cycle, and Tarkanian has planted himself well within conservative orthodoxy on gun issues at least since 2010. In 2012, the most recent grade available, he earned a C+. Roberson’s ad cherry-picked a decade-old rating and left out context about Tarkanian’s more recent comments in opposition to gun control.

pomt-00044	Says Tony Thurmond was "Reprimanded by the Obama Administration for failing to address widespread sexual harassment and assault in district schools."	false	/california/statements/2018/nov/05/students-parents-and-teachers-supporting-marshall-/false-attack-ads-claim-tony-thurmond-was-reprimand/	Was candidate for California schools chief Tony Thurmond "reprimanded" by the Obama administration over assault and sexual harassment problems in his school district? That's one of the eye-opening claims in a recent TV attack ad by a group supporting Marshall Tuck, Thurmond’s opponent in the race. The two Democrats are running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Thurmond is a state assemblyman who represents Richmond, Berkeley and other East Bay communities and is supported by teacher unions. Tuck is a former education executive backed by charter school groups. The incumbent, Tom Torlakson, will be termed out in January after serving two four-year terms. The candidates and groups supporting them have produced a flurry of negative ads in recent weeks after raising tens of millions of dollars, turning this typically low-key statewide race into a highly-contested campaign. We wanted to know whether there was evidence to support the claim Thurmond was "reprimanded" by the Obama administration. Our research Before becoming a state lawmaker, Thurmond served on the board of the West Contra Costa Unified School District, based in Richmond, from 2008 to 2012. The TV attack ad refers to a formal censure of the district by the Obama administration, which was addressed to the district’s superintendent. Here’s the full version of the attack ad: "Before he was running for State Superintendent, politician Tony Thurmond was responsible for a school district with widespread budget problems. Ranked last in the state for failing to serve students of color. Sued for leaving at-risk students in rotting trailers with mushrooms growing in the floors. Reprimanded by the Obama Administration for failing to address widespread sexual harassment and assault in district schools. Tony Thurmond failed the students he was supposed to help. California deserves better." Marshall Tuck-supporting PAC ad targeting Tony Thurmond, 2018 from EdSource on Vimeo. The ad was produced by Students, Parents and Teachers supporting Marshall Tuck, an independent expenditure group created by EdVoice, a nonprofit that supports charter schools. During the voiceover, the ad uses misleading text to blur the distinction between action taken against the school district and Thurmond specifically. The text reads: "TONY THURMOND: Reprimanded by the Obama Administration." We looked to the analysis by EdSource, a nonprofit news organization that covers education, on this claim: "The claim that Thurmond was reprimanded by the Obama administration is false. The letter from the Obama-era Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights criticizing West Contra Costa Unified’s handling of sexual harassment never mentions Thurmond or the district’s board. The letter was issued in 2013, after Thurmond left the board, though it does state the department’s investigation began during his term in 2010." The letter was addressed to the superintendent of the school district. "I was never reprimanded by Obama," Thurmond told EdSource, which also reported the ad prompted Thurmond’s campaign to send a cease and desist order to the committee that produced it. A spokeswoman for EdVoice pointed us to a website created by the independent expenditure group backing Tuck. It repeats the same claims in the TV ad and includes a link to the Obama-era letter. But it doesn’t offer any information that directly connects Thurmond to the reprimand. When we asked Thurmond’s campaign about the claim, it pointed to groups and individuals from the NAACP to U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who have all called out the ad. In a related fact check, we rated False the claim Thurmond was "sued" by the ACLU for leaving students in unsafe conditions. Our ruling A recent TV attack ad by a group supporting Marshall Tuck claimed the Obama administration "reprimanded" Tony Thurmond over assault and sexual harassment problems when he served on a school district board. Obama’s Education Department censured West Contra Costa Unified’s handling of sexual harassment during a period when Thurmond served on the district’s board. But the the report never mentions Thurmond and was addressed to the district’s superintendent. School district administrators, not board members, are responsible for day-to-day management in the district. The text of the TV ad distorts the facts by wrongly singling out Thurmond.

pomt-12622	"There are about as many members of the Armed Forces marching bands as there are American diplomats."	mostly false	/global-news/statements/2017/mar/31/nicholas-burns/are-there-more-military-band-members-diplomats/	President Donald Trump is meeting bipartisan resistance to his plan to trim about 30 percent from the State Department and foreign aid to help pay for a big boost in defense. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle on the House Foreign Affairs Committee pushed back against such hefty cuts at a March 28 hearing. They asked one witness, former ambassador Nicholas Burns, what he thought of them. Burns served in the administrations of Bill Clinton and both Bushes. He cautioned that "the only place to cut in the State Department is personnel." "You're going to have to make some cruel choices," Burns continued. "The State Department is not big. As Bob Gates said when he was secretary of defense, there are about as many members of the Armed Forces marching bands as there are American diplomats." That certainly gave the trade-off between ammo and diplomacy an unusual twist. We thought we’d dig into the numbers. The result? This comparison is a bit off key. There’s no question that the Pentagon keeps thousands of musicians on hand. A fact sheet on the 2017 Defense appropriations bill said "the Defense Department currently fields more than 130 military bands worldwide, composed of more than 6,000 musicians." In 2016, Politico reported that the total number of trombone, trumpet, keyboard and other instrument players stands at about 6,500. That’s a lot of Souza marches, but the State Department fields a bigger squad of diplomats. There are 8,106 Foreign Service officers, according to a State Department report. (The State Department has about another 5,700 people to support the diplomats, but they don’t do direct diplomatic work.) Still, there are a good 1,600 more diplomats than musicians. Among that slender subset of the population that talks about the State Department budget, this is a popular comparison. Burns, as he said, was citing Gates, who in turn had borrowed the line from former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Although, reading Gates’ words from 2010, it sounds as if he thought Rice was speaking a bit over the top. "Condi Rice used to say, 'We have more people in military bands than they have in the Foreign Service.' She was not far wrong," Gates said. Hillary Clinton used a permutation of this talking point in her 2009 confirmation hearing for secretary of state. She said "there are more members in military bands than there are Foreign Service officers serving overseas." (Our emphasis.) All of them used the quasi-stat to underscore that Congress finds it easier to fund the Defense Department than the State Department. We shared our findings with Burns; he said it was helpful to know it wasn’t accurate. "In any case, the Foreign Service is quite small in comparison to DOD and Homeland Security," he said. "The Trump proposal to cut State/USAID by 31 percent is reckless." Making the comparison department-wide, Burns is on firmer ground. Including support staff, the State Department has about 14,000 people in the Foreign Service. The Defense Department has about 1.3 million active duty soldiers. On that scale, the 1,600 person advantage that diplomats hold over band members is a rounding error. For close readers, we note that Burns added the "marching" part. We don’t know how many military musicians walk and how many sit. From the military bands’ websites, it does seem they do a lot of marching. Our ruling Burns said that there are about as many members of military marching bands as there are diplomats. In plain numbers, there are about 6,500 military musicians and about 8,100 diplomats. So, in fact, the diplomats have about a 1,600 staff advantage. But in the sense that diplomats are the backbone of the Foreign Service, while musicians, as important as they might be for morale, play a lesser numerical role in defending the nation, the numbers are closer than simple math would say. It’s time to retune this talking point, but on balance, we rate it Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Nicholas Burns	None	None	None	2017-03-31T15:21:14	2017-03-28	['United_States']
pomt-13819	Says middle-class New York State residents will have the "lowest tax rate in 70 years."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2016/jul/15/andrew-cuomo/new-tax-rates-will-be-lowest-70-years/	Gov. Andrew Cuomo thinks you can win money by making a bet with someone on New York State’s tax rates. Ask people about what the state has done with the rates, and "everybody’s going to say, ‘raise taxes,’ because it is inconceivable that a government actually lowers taxes," Cuomo said. At public appearances recently, Cuomo touted what he called the lowest tax rate for the middle class in 70 years. "Wager anyone you know and say, ‘Did New York State raise taxes or lower taxes?’ " Cuomo said. "New York State has lowered taxes for everyone in the state and every income level in the state." Taxes are always a top issue for voters. So does the governor’s claim check out? Are middle-class state residents taxed at the lowest rate in seven decades? Who’s in the middle? No official state definition exists for the "middle class." But in the scope of today’s tax brackets, the middle class are those making between about $40,000 to $300,000 a year. Who’s included in the middle class has changed over time with the rate of inflation. A salary today of $80,000 is equivalent to a $9,000 salary in 1953. The tax brackets used today are not the same as those used in past decades. In 1946, anyone making more than $9,000 was taxed at a 3.5 percent rate. The next year the rate increased to 4.2 percent. In 1948, the rate jumped to 6.3 percent, and that’s the year the Cuomo administration bases its claim. The Department of Tax and Finance says most - if not all - earners in the middle class in 1948 would have paid the top rate. That year the top rate applied to people making about $9,000. That fits what the state has defined as middle class in today’s dollars, and the Department of Tax and Finance says that’s how the middle class would have been defined in that year. How low? Since 1948, the lowest top tax rate fell to between 6.45 and 6.65 percent for people in the same comparable income bracket. That was in 2014, and remains at that level. That’s higher than the now-scheduled rate for 2025 as part of this year’s resolution. Anyone making between $40,000 and $150,000 will see their income tax rate drop to 5.5 percent by that year. The tax rate will drop to 6 percent for those making between $150,000 and $300,000. But there are caveats. The rates do not factor in tax exemptions or deductions, as pointed out by E.J. McMahon from the Empire Center for Public Policy. The center researches and analyzes the state’s economy, including the tax law. To some extent, the tax rates for 2025 and 1948 are like apples to oranges, McMahon said. "It’s much like saying the 2016 Ford Focus has the best headroom since the 1946 Ford Tudor — the two tax codes and the household situations to which they apply are that different," McMahon said. He wrote recently the new rates will be the largest tax cut since the mid-1990s, when lawmakers passed the Taxpayer Relief Act. At the time, the legislation dropped taxes to the lowest rates since 1954. The new tax rates, once fully phased in, will be even lower, according to the Department of Taxation and Finance data. An analysis from the Fiscal Policy Institute confirms Cuomo’s claim holds true - but like McMahon, the institute points out the income range that defines the middle class looks different today than it did 70 years ago. The 1958 exception The Department of Taxation and Finance, in a different report, reveals another interesting historical nugget. Employers were not required by law to withhold tax until 1959. According to the document, because this would have required two years of taxes to be paid in just one year, taxes were ‘canceled’ for 1958 - meaning the tax rate for that year was zero. Our ruling Governor Andrew M. Cuomo claimed new tax rates passed by lawmakers during this year’s state budget process are the lowest in the state in 70 years. Data from the Department of Taxation and Finance backs up his claim. Because of an unusual set of circumstances, there was no income tax rate in 1958 as the state implemented a new system. The first year rates will appear lower than the 1948 rates will be in 2019. We rate this claim as Mostly True.	None	Andrew Cuomo	None	None	None	2016-07-15T12:18:37	2016-06-22	['None']
pomt-05491	A proposed regional transportation tax will last "a minimum" of 10 years, and has been approved to last longer.	false	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/18/anonymous-flier/flier-casts-transportation-referendum-never-ending/	A flier about a vote to raise money for metro Atlanta roads and transit says the plan would create a tax that may never die. The anonymous handout appeared at an April 4 Fayette County Commission workshop, where an Atlanta Regional Commission planner spoke about the transportation special local option sales tax, otherwise known as T-SPLOST. If voters approve it July 31, it will raise an estimated $7.2 billion to build a slate of transportation projects. (The referendum comes with a regional list of projects that total $6.14 billion. In addition, about $1 billion will be sent back to the counties and towns where it was raised.) The flier listed what it said were 10 transportation facts. This one topped the list: "This 1% tax is scheduled for a minimum of 10 years with additional renewals authorized," it said. ARC representatives kept the handout. A spokeswoman sent a copy to PolitiFact Georgia when we requested it. The sentence is a little muddled, but its meaning was clear to PolitiFact Georgia reporters and others who read it: T-SPLOST will last "a minimum" of 10 years, and has been approved to last longer than that. We wondered whether the tax will rise up like a zombie from "The Walking Dead," ready to terrorize metro Atlantans for decades to come. Some fiscal conservatives are fighting the T-SPLOST because they think the government already spends too much money and will use these tax dollars on the wrong projects. Supporters say it will help untangle traffic in a region that’s become notorious for it. Transportation fees that don’t expire are a sore point in metro Atlanta. A toll to finance the building of Ga. 400 was set to expire in 2010, but the State Road and Tollway Authority Board voted to extend it for 10 more years. Gov. Nathan Deal was running for office back then. He promised to revoke the toll by the end of 2011. He didn’t, and earned a Promise Broken on our Deal-O-Meter. Now back to our fact check. We tried to track down the flier’s authors, but came up empty-handed. The handout cited Georgia Statute 48-8-245 (b)2 as the source of information on the tax’s expiration, or lack of one. The statute was written as part of Georgia’s Transportation Investment Act of 2010. The Transportation Investment Act created a process that lets voters decide by region whether to raise taxes to upgrade transportation infrastructure. We read the law and found it does not say what the flier claimed. To the contrary, it lets the proposed tax expire before 10 years are up. Statute 48-8-245 (b) says the tax ends on the earliest of two dates: after 10 years, or if the state revenue commissioner determines the tax has reached its funding goal. For metro Atlanta, that goal is $7.2 billion, or $8.5 billion over 10 years in today's dollars, according to a June 2011 story in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Whether the region reaches its goal ahead of time depends on the economy and how much consumers spend. Voters must approve any extensions. Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Debbie Dooley, whose group was not involved in the creation of the handout, said voters might feel that they must continue the tax. The new infrastructure may need costly maintenance. Some projects may go over budget. Politicians won’t want to give these tax dollars back, Dooley predicted. "They’ll be back with their hands out in 10 years," she said. Still, the flier needs to be revised to say that voters will decide whether to renew the tax, Dooley said. We agree. T-SPLOST may indeed survive its 10-year life span, but a zombie tax would be a creature of voters’ own making. The anonymous flier earns a False.

pomt-14458	Says Donald Trump has written 10 checks to Hillary Clinton "and four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. … It was to her presidential campaign."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-donald-trump-wrote-10-checks-hillary/	During the Republican presidential debate in Detroit, Ted Cruz went after Donald Trump by bringing up the real estate developer’s past donations to the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. Cruz said, "Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times. Ten times. And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business. It was to her presidential campaign." We found that Cruz has a point that Trump has given multiple donations to Clinton, including to her presidential campaign. However, Cruz’s count is too high, and with the presidential donations, there is less than meets the eye. (We aren’t looking at Trump’s donations to the Clinton Foundation.) We looked up donations by Trump both in the Federal Election Commission donor lookup and a similar tool offered by the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks campaign contributions. Cruz’s number -- 10 donations -- matches the number of donations that come up when searching the FEC site for donations by "Donald Trump." However, searching that way lumps in donations made by Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Weeding out the son’s donations requires clicking into the scanned images of his donation disclosure forms. Here’s a summary of the elder Trump’s donations to Clinton: Date Amount Senate or presidential 05/01/2002 $1,000 Senate 03/23/2005 $1,000 Senate 09/30/2005 $900 Senate 12/02/2005 $1,000 Senate 11/01/2006 $200 Senate 11/12/2007 $600 Presidential 11/09/2009 $1,700 Presidential 11/10/2009 -$2,300 (refund) Presidential This data supports Cruz’s general point that Trump has made multiple donations to Clinton over the years. But Cruz is off on the specifics in several ways. First, the number of total donations isn’t 10, as Cruz said, but seven. The number of donations to her presidential campaign wasn’t four, as Cruz said, but two. Second, the total amount of Trump donations to Clinton’s presidential campaign were refunded in November 2009. Who requested this refund -- Trump or Clinton -- was not recorded in the documentation. Third, the timing of both Trump’s biggest presidential donation and the refund is also curious. The money was not spent and refunded during the heat of the 2008 presidential primary campaign, when Clinton was running. Rather, the transactions came a full year after Barack Obama -- Clinton’s primary rival -- had already been elected president. If we can learn any more about the circumstances of these donations and refunds, we will update this article. Members of Trump’s immediate family also gave money to Clinton over the years. His wife, Melania, gave one donation of $2,000 to Clinton’s Senate campaign in 2006. His daughter, Ivanka, gave three donations totaling $4,400 to Clinton’s Senate campaign in 2006 and 2007. And Donald Trump Jr. gave three donations worth $6,100 in 2006 and 2007, minus a refund of $1,700 in 2008. On net, the younger Trump gave $2,100 in donations to Clinton’s Senate campaign and $2,300 to her presidential campaign. Indeed, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told PolitiFact that "between Trump and his children, it is 10 times. It is all Donald Trump's money." However, we don't consider this money to be Trump's -- his wife and the children who donated are adults -- and Cruz didn't refer to Trump's family at large. Our ruling Cruz said Donald Trump has written 10 checks to Hillary Clinton "and four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. … It was to her presidential campaign." He has a point that Trump has made multiple campaign donations to Clinton, but he overstated the amounts. Trump ended up making five donations worth $4,100 to Clinton’s Senate campaign, and two donations worth $2,300 to her presidential campaign. The presidential donations were eventually refunded in their entirety. We rate Cruz’s statement Half True.

pomt-06480	Says Texas Senate hopeful Donna Campbell doesn’t live in the district she’s hoping to win in 2012.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/oct/17/burnt-orange-report/democratic-blogger-says-donna-campbell-doesnt-live/	Democratic blogger Katherine Haenschen, writing on the Austin-based Burnt Orange Report, welcomed word that Republican state Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio is likely drawing a challenger in his party’s March primary. In an Oct. 3, 2011, entry, Haenschen noted that the prospective candidate, Donna Campbell, who is a physician, failed to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin in 2010. "This should be interesting," Haenschen wrote. "Dr. Donna is viewed by many as being actually insane." We can’t check looniness, but Haenschen’s blog included a seemingly verifiable claim: "Dr. Donna, by the way, does not currently live in the (senatorial) district ... but is apparently planning to move to Hays County." The Texas Constitution holds that a Senate candidate must have been a resident of the district he or she seeks to represent for at least a year before election. And Wentworth represents the 25th Senatorial District, which runs from a portion of Bexar County north through all of Comal, Guadalupe, Hays and Kendall counties and into a sliver of Travis County, though its boundaries are penciled in to change a bit in time for next year’s election. The 2011 Legislature, acting on results of the 2010 census, reduced the parts of Guadalupe, Hays and Travis counties in the district. By email, Haenschen told us she based her residency claim on information provided by Hays County activists. Separately, we looked up a 2010 Republican Party of Texas candidate list showing Campbell as based in Columbus, in Colorado County, which is east of the 25th Senatorial District. After digging through several bits of conflicting information, though, we’ve concluded that Campbell has since moved to New Braunfels. As we began to check into the residency question, representatives of the Colorado County tax assessor-collector’s office told us Campbell was registered to vote in the county under the name Donna Burrows Campbell. But on Oct. 11, about a week after the Burnt Orange Report’s blog post, Campbell registered to vote in Guadalupe County, we confirmed with the county clerk’s office there. The New Braunfels address that Campbell listed on the voter registration form is within the 25th Senate District, the Guadalupe County elections administrator told us. More conflicting information came when we checked on Campbell’s homestead, which is one’s principal residence for tax purposes. When we visited the website for Colorado County’s Central Appraisal District, it showed a homestead tax exemption for Donna Burrows on property on Texas 71 in the county. In a telephone interview, though, Olga Poncik of the Colorado County appraisal district told us the property is not registered as a homestead, though it was for 2010. In an Oct. 6, 2011, interview, Campbell campaign consultant Luke Macias told us Campbell lives in New Braunfels. Declining our request to interview Campbell, he said that if Campbell were pulled over for speeding, she’d pull out her driver’s license showing that address. Asked for a copy of the license, he sent us a copy of an undated letter from the Texas Department of Public Safety to Campbell at the New Braunfels address, headlined: "Attached is your new driver license/identification card." Our ruling We were frustrated in this check because the blogger did not prove her claim and Campbell didn’t discuss it with us. Our sense, based on available information, is that while Campbell formerly lived in Colorado County and was even still registered to vote there at the time of the Burnt Orange Report blog post, she settled in the 25th District, and obtained a driver’s license there, some time after voting in October 2010 and before the blogger aired her claim. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Burnt Orange Report	None	None	None	2011-10-17T06:00:00	2011-10-03	['None']
pomt-10600	"I won the majority of the Republican vote in both New Hampshire and South Carolina."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/24/john-mccain/when-first-means-second/	Pressed on his credentials with GOP voters, John McCain said he won them over in two early primaries. But he didn't. Exit polls from the Jan. 19, 2008, primary show he narrowly lost to Mike Huckabee among self-identified Republicans in South Carolina, 32 percent to 31 percent. And in New Hampshire, exit polls show Mitt Romney beat McCain 35 percent to 34 percent. However, it should be noted that a few news agencies, including MSNBC, showed McCain narrowly winning among Republicans in their results. The topic is important to McCain because he has often struggled to win over die-hard Republicans. Exit polls show moderate and independent voters powered both of his victories. But when the schedule moves to states like Florida, where primaries are closed to independents, his need for Republican support becomes critical. The exit polls show that McCain didn't lose among Republicans in either state. When you factor in a margin of error, both are statistical ties. But what McCain said was that he "won the majority" of Republicans in those states, and we don't find any evidence that that's true. We rule McCain's statement False.

pomt-05408	Says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as "half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-jobs-finland/	Is your tax money paying for jobs in Finland? A TV ad running in eight states blames President Barack Obama for sending stimulus money overseas while Americans are out of work. "Tell President Obama, American tax dollars should help American taxpayers," the narrator says. Instead, $2.3 billion in tax credits funded jobs in Mexico, Finland and China, the ad claims. Americans for Prosperity, a group dedicated to "educating citizens about economic policy" that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad April 26, 2012. Here’s the string of claims, starting with an image of the president signing a bill: Washington promised to create American jobs. We passed their stimulus. But that's not what happened. Fact: Billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas, while millions of Americans can't find a job. $1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico. Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China. We rated one claim from the ad, about stimulus tax credits supposedly funding a plant in Mexico, a Pants on Fire falsehood. A second claim, on building traffic lights in China, we rated Mostly False. In this fact-check, we’re examining if those tax credits included "half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland." (We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.) The ad said its source for the Finland claim was an ABC News article, "Car Company Gets U.S. Loan, Builds Cars In Finland." A loan for U.S. work The first clue something’s wrong is in that ABC News headline. A car company got a "U.S. loan." That’s not the same thing as a tax credit. Taxpayers expect to get loan money back, with interest. (Though, they don’t always. See: Solyndra.) Things get even more wrong from there. That U.S. loan program? It's the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program through the Energy Department. And it's not funded by Obama’s stimulus bill — otherwise known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It is, in fact, a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008. The program was designed to support development of advanced technology vehicles. The Bush administration was in charge when the automaker filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company’s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it. Now, the ad could have raised relevant criticism of the Energy Department’s loan programs. Watchdogs inside and outside government have argued since the Bush administration that the programs haven’t included safeguards sufficient to protect taxpayers. Instead, the ad says stimulus tax credits funded overseas jobs. That’s the claim we’re weighing here. And that’s just not the case. Fisker Automotive, a U.S. automaker with global headquarters in Anaheim, Calif., got its $529 million federal loan to develop and produce two lines of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles — the Karma and the Nina. The project was expected to create about 2,000 jobs in Wilmington, Del., where the Nina would be manufactured, according to the Energy Department. Part of the loan — $169 million — paid for design, engineering and other work in the United States on the Fisker Karma. A larger part — $359 million — was slated to help buy and reconfigure a shuttered General Motors plant in Delaware to build the Nina. Here’s where Finland enters the story: Before its Energy Department loans were approved, Fisker had decided it would manufacture the Karma at a plant in Finland. The company argued there simply wasn’t a U.S. plant available for the type of car they were building. But 65 percent of the parts for the Karma, based on cost, would come from U.S. suppliers. "There was no contract manufacturer in the U.S. that could actually produce our vehicle," Henrik Fisker, the company's founder, told ABC News. "They don't exist here." The loan for the design of the car "was only used for the U.S. operations" and could not be spent overseas, according to Fisker and the Energy Department. Meanwhile, most of the loan has yet to be disbursed. Fisker says it stopped taking loan money from the Energy Department in May 2011, after drawing $190 million — most of it for Karma design and development. Its Nina project, now called the Atlantic, has been delayed. The News Journal in Wilmington, Del., reported the payments to Fisker stopped after the company failed to meet Energy Department milestones set as conditions for the loan. "Our loan documents require borrowers to meet certain milestones and other conditions prior to receiving loan proceeds," department spokesman Damien LaVera told PolitiFact. "As has been widely reported, Fisker has experienced some delays in its sales and production schedule -- which is common for start-ups. "As Fisker works through those issues and incorporates lessons learned from the production of the Karma, the department is working with Fisker to review a revised business plan and determine the best path forward so the company can meet its benchmarks, produce cars and employ workers here in America." That makes it an open question when the Delaware plant will produce Fisker autos. As of April, it only employed a small maintenance team. In the meantime, it's not getting loan money. Our ruling An ad from Americans for Prosperity starts with an image of Obama and says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as "half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland." The reality: Half a billion in loans from a Bush-era program were approved for Fisker Automotive. But they weren’t tax credits, weren’t part of the stimulus bill, and didn’t go to Finland. And so far, the company has only gotten $190 million in those loans, far less than the half a billion. Instead, the U.S. company spent a third of the money on U.S. engineering of a new electric vehicle. It chose to manufacture the car in Finland, without U.S. help. Another two-thirds of the loan, which it may or may not get, will go toward retooling a shuttered GM plant in Delaware. The ad strings together disparate statements to tell a concocted story. The result is simply False.	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2012-05-03T11:11:33	2012-04-26	['Finland']
pomt-00703	"The U.S. representatives that voted to keep militarizing the police received 73 percent more campaign money from the defense industry" than the representatives who voted to stop it.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/30/representus/did-lawmakers-who-voted-keep-defense-surplus-progr/	The recent unrest in Baltimore following the death of an African-American man who’d been taken into police custody has gotten people debating on social media, questioning the role of the federal government in militarizing local police. A reader asked us to check a meme on this topic that recently entered their social media feed. "The U.S. representatives that voted to keep militarizing the police received 73 percent more campaign money from the defense industry," the meme reads. It accompanies an image of a phalanx of helmeted police with guns raised at a suspect whose hands are raised in surrender. The meme was created by represent.us, which was founded in 2012 and describes itself as "building a fiercely nonpartisan movement to pass tough anti-corruption laws in cities and states across America." Its board members range include former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer, GOP strategist Mark McKinnon, former disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig and D.C.-based think tanker Norm Ornstein. We thought the meme merited a closer look. Checking the number The source of the statistical claim was not hard to find. It originated with a study done using an online tool created by MapLight, a website that tracks and analyzes money in politics. The study looked at how lawmakers voted on an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2015 (H.R. 4870) that would have prohibited the use of funds to transfer various types of surplus military vehicles and gear to local and state police forces through a Pentagon program established in the late 1990s known as the 1033 program. The amendment in question was offered by Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., on June 19, 2014. It failed by a vote of 62-355, but the MapLight study found some interesting statistics. The study tallied up all of the donations to lawmakers from the defense industry between Jan. 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2013, using seven categories of industrial sectors tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics. It determined that lawmakers who voted against the amendment took in $53,153 from defense-related donors, while those who voted in favor of the amendment took in $31,240 from those same industries. That means the "no" voters received 70 percent more in defense donations than did the "yes" voters. That’s slightly off from the 73 percent cited in the meme, but it’s pretty close. (We found an older article on Maplight that said "73 percent"; MapLight staff told us the difference likely arose when a legislator returned a contribution, and the data automatically updated.) So the number is close to the mark. But what about the significance of this finding? This is less certain. What does the connection actually mean? As we noted, the 1033 program gives surplus military goods to local and state law enforcement, so it’s not obvious how the defense industry would benefit from a vote to keep the 1033 program alive. The industry sells its goods only to the Pentagon; the 1033 program doesn’t open up a pipeline for the industry to sell its products to local law enforcement. Nor does the industry get a cut of the transaction with state and local police forces. Some experts told PolitiFact that they don’t see how the defense industry would have a dog in this particular fight. "There is no reason to think that defense contractors benefit from the 1033 program," said Benjamin H. Friedman, a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "The transfer of military goods to local or state authorities is quite unlikely to affect what the Pentagon orders in the first place." Friedman called the connection "likely spurious." Brent Skorup, who has studied the issue for the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said that while the meme "seems to imply that lobbying dollars buys votes … the causation is pretty complicated, and I think the implication is overblown." Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, agreed that the link was likely "tenuous." "It is possible that defense companies could profit by selling spare parts for that equipment to state and local governments," he said. "If the Defense Department simply destroyed the equipment, the companies would have a smaller market for (original equipment-manufacturer) parts, in theory. But a lot of the equipment being transferred doesn’t seem like it would have the potential for high-priced, high-volume spare parts. I don’t see much of a connection here." A spokesman for Represent.us, Mansur Gidfar, disagreed. He said the existence of the 1033 program indirectly benefits the defense industry because it allows the Pentagon to err on the larger side when making orders. "The Pentagon may not be ordering more than they need intentionally, but I have to imagine ‘we're passing these resources on to communities that need them to keep the streets safe’ is a much more palatable talking point than ‘we ordered too much and now they're sitting in a warehouse,’ " Gidfar said. In addition, at least one armored-vehicle contractor -- Lenco Industries, which sells to both the military and domestic law enforcement market -- advertises federal grant-writing classes to police, which suggests that suppliers take an interest in such legislation. Vehicles initially obtained through the 1033 program may hook police forces on their products and spur direct purchases further down the road. Given the uncertainties, Gidfar said that his group was careful when creating the meme to highlight the correlation between defense-industry dollars and voting -- not a causal relationship. Indeed, several experts noted that it may be an independent variable -- the lawmaker’s philosophical or ideological affinity for a strong military and aggressive policing -- that could account for both the larger acceptance of defense-industry money and a "no" vote on the amendment. Ultimately, "it is up to citizens to decide whether or not money played a role in how their legislator voted," said Pamela Behrsin, MapLight’s vice president of communications and a contributor to the original study. Our ruling The group Represent.us created a meme that read, "The U.S. Representatives that voted to keep militarizing the police received 73 percent more campaign money from the defense industry" than did the representatives who voted to stop it. The correct number is actually 70 percent, which is close to what the meme said. But it’s worth noting there's significant doubt about how meaningful this connection is. Several independent experts said it’s not obvious that the defense industry would have a strong self-interest in supporting the continued existence of the program, and if they don’t, that would undercut the meme’s underlying message. Others say defense contractors do have a small but real interest in seeing that police get the equipment. Overall, the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. Correction: This article has been changed to reflect that Maplight's data on campaign contributions automatically updates. We initially reported that a numerical difference was due to mistaken typing.	None	Represent.us	None	None	None	2015-04-30T14:58:24	2015-04-30	['United_States']
pomt-04239	"In 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/19/big-gamble-nj/group-claims-new-jerseys-classrooms-received-930-m/	Budget woes abound in storm-battered and cash-strapped New Jersey, and now one group claims the state is rolling the dice on its fourth largest revenue source: the lottery. The Communication Workers of America, a union that represents lottery workers, and the Asian American Retailers Association, a group representing convenience and liquor stores and gas stations, has launched a campaign -- called Big Gamble NJ -- to oppose the state’s plan to contract with a private company to manage the lottery’s sales and marketing. Last week Big Gamble NJ started promoting a website that argues such a move would hurt small businesses and taxpayers. On Nov. 13, one slide on the group’s homepage read: "In 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million." Another slide read: "New Jersey businesses earned nearly $150 million from lottery sales last year alone." Under those slides, the website states, "tell Governor Christie and your state legislators not to gamble with New Jersey's lottery revenues" and provides a link to sign a petition. Here PolitiFact New Jersey checked whether the lottery handed out more than $900 million to schools in 2011. We learned that’s not quite the case. A good chunk of the $930 million helped fund education in New Jersey, but not all of it. The constitutional amendment voters passed in 1969 that authorized the establishment of the state lottery dictated that its "entire net proceeds" must go toward state institutions and education aid. The state lottery doled out $930 million to such causes in fiscal year 2011. Nearly three-quarters of that money went toward education-related initiatives, according to the state lottery’s annual report. More than $105 million funded programs in the state education department, including about $53 million for school construction and renovation. The majority of the money -- more than $580 million -- benefited higher education. More than half of that $580 million was dedicated to operating costs for public colleges. Still, about a quarter of the the $930 million paid for other social services. Roughly $156 million helped fund state psychiatric hospitals and centers for the developmentally disabled received nearly $47 million. More than $36 million in lottery proceeds bulked up operating support for homes for disabled soldiers. So education-related initiatives received a large majority, but not all, of the $930 million in contributions from the lottery in 2011. Seth Hahn, the New Jersey legislative and political director for Communications Workers of America, acknowledged the error on Wednesday afternoon. The website was updated that evening. It now reads: "In 2011, our public lottery funded classrooms & other services by over $930 million." Still, Hahn said that didn’t change the fundamental issue that the proposal is bad for businesses and taxpayers. The history of privatization in New Jersey is a "story of graft, fraud and cronyism leading to taxpayers being on the hook for political indiscretion," he said. "We believe that when it comes to funding education, care for the developmentally disabled, and services for our veterans, New Jerseyans deserve better." Bill Quinn, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, said the implication that the state is selling the lottery is false. He said a state agency "will still have an oversight function" and "the state is going to continue to get the money from the lottery." Our ruling Big Gamble NJ -- an advocacy group that opposes privatizing management of the state lottery -- said on its website that "in 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million." The lottery funneled $930 million into education and other social services in fiscal year 2011. Nearly three quarters of that amount funded education-related initiatives. So New Jersey’s classroom didn’t receive the full $930 million from the state lottery, but education aid comprised a significant majority of that money. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-03322	Says "our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/25/barack-obama/obama-says-deficit-falling-fastest-rate-60-years/	President Barack Obama aimed to refocus the national debate and put the economy front and center with a speech at Knox College in Illinois. It was the same place he spoke as a senator in 2005 about the need for the government to help the middle class. He stuck to that theme in this speech, but now as president, he summarized the improvements that have come on his watch. He talked about millions of new jobs, burgeoning energy production, and the nation’s improving balance sheet. "Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years," Obama told the crowd. In light of Obama’s ongoing battle with Republicans over taxes and spending, we thought this would be an interesting claim to examine. In this factcheck, we look at whether we are really seeing one of the most rapid declines in the deficit in many decades. As a reminder, the deficit is a snapshot of one year’s fiscal outlook. It’s the shortfall between what the government spends and what the government collects in taxes and other revenues. The White House press office told us that the proof is in the numbers. They tracked the deficit as a percent of the entire economy, measured as the Gross Domestic Product. In 2009, the first year of Obama’s presidency, after tax cuts and new spending, the deficit was 10.1 percent of GDP. In 2012, the deficit declined to 7 percent of GDP. So that’s a decline of 3.1 percentage points. You have to go back 63 years to the period between 1946 and 1949 to find a bigger four-year drop than what the country saw between 2009 and 2012. Right after World War II ended, the U.S. deficit stood at 7.2 percent of GDP. By 1949, America had a surplus of 0.2 percent. So that’s a decline of 7.4 percentage points. We downloaded data from the Office of Management and Budget that shows the deficit as a percent of GDP all the way back to 1930. When we ran the numbers, we found, as Obama said, you need to go back to 1946 to find a larger change. The numbers game As with any statistics, you have to be careful, and to help us be careful, we contacted five economists and policy analysts. The White House simply did a little subtraction to measure the difference between the numbers at the start and the end of the four years. There is another option, which is to look at the relative size of the decline. So if the deficit went from 10.1 percent of GDP to 7 percent of GDP, that means the deficit dropped 30 percent. But when we did this going back to World War II, we saw some very strange results. Big deficit declines could look smaller in relative terms than small declines. Jason Peuquet, research director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization that seeks to reduce deficits faster than the president has done, confirmed that point. Peuquet said the administration has the right approach, because relative numbers can make very different changes look the same. Peuquet gave the example of a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in the first year and 0.5 percent after four years. "That would look like a 50 percent improvement in the level," Peuquet said. "However, a change in deficits that went from 10 percent of GDP to 5 percent of GDP would also register as a 50 percent improvement – despite being a much larger change in relation to the economy." Peuquet and others raised a second statistical issue -- choosing the endpoints for the comparison. It’s a common device to pick the range that best proves your point. But in the case of deficit reduction, no one quibbled with the idea that longer periods are more revealing, and Obama used all the years he has available. His first year in office was 2009 and the numbers for 2013 are not yet in. To the extent that a majority view emerged, economist Alan Auerbach at the University of California Berkeley probably expressed it best. "There is no single ‘correct’ way of doing the analysis," Auerbach said, "but I would say that their approach is a reasonable one." One reason Obama is able to point to an historically high decline is because the deficit as a percent of GDP had never been higher. Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group focused on taxes and spending, said the reduction is significant. But at the same time, he said, "Let’s face it, there was a lot to reduce. The deficit was morbidly obese." Similarly, the economy took a major hit which gave it more room for improvement in historic terms. So even a moderate recovery has eased the deficit by both increasing tax receipts and reducing demand for government aid such as unemployment support. Lastly, while the deficit might decline, the country’s accumulated debt is projected to grow. "The future path is not captured in snapshots of what happened over the past few years, Peuquet said. "It ignores the unsustainable debt trajectory the country still faces." Our ruling Barack Obama said the deficit has fallen at the fastest rate in 60 years. While economists vary on how to best measure that decline, the president used an acceptable approach and his numbers are accurate. There are no statistical tricks in play. Our experts warned against reading too much into Obama’s claim. While Obama did not spend much time one way or the other on the significance of the decline in the deficit, he didn’t mention ongoing concerns over the national debt. We rate the statement True.

pomt-03952	"Agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/feb/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-said-weve-always-needed-foreign-worker/	One reason the U.S. needs immigration reform is to ensure we have enough farm workers, says U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio was part of the bipartisan "Gang of Eight" that unveiled an immigration framework in January. The framework includes a path to residency and citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants and would give special consideration to farm workers, among other groups. Rubio has been shopping around these principles to conservative news outlets, including a Jan. 30 column on the conservative RedState.com. Part of his column focused on immigrant farm labor. "Agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad, but we do not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S.," Rubio wrote. Rubio called for a "modernized agricultural worker program" that "allows our growers to contract the seasonal and year round labor they need legally." The part that drew our attention was his broad claim that "agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad." We wondered whether it was accurate to make such a blanket statement without any parameters for time period or type of farm. In a related fact-check, we will explore whether the U.S. has a system for farmers to legally import foreign workers. Rubio's evidence Over the past 15 years, about half of the hired workers employed in U.S. crop agriculture were unauthorized, with the overwhelming majority of these workers coming from Mexico, according to research based on the U.S. Department of Labor’s National Agricultural Workers Survey. Rubio’s office sent us a few reports from government agencies and researchers that looked at the history of immigrant workers in agriculture. Most notably, there was the Bracero program, a program that brought in temporary farm workers mostly from Mexico between 1942 and 1964, peaking at almost a half-million workers, according to a 1965 U.S. Department of Agriculture report. While that sounds like a significant number of foreign workers, they were more common in some places than others. Braceros primarily farmed vegetables, fruits, cotton and sugar beets, and they were concentrated in seven states: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Michigan and Texas. By the 1960s, mechanization reduced the need for these workers for some crops. Historians weigh in about Rubio’s claim We interviewed several historians who specialize in American history, immigration or agriculture. They said it is difficult to generalize about the agricultural workforce, because it differs by time period, location and type of farm. "It's not as simple as you might think," said University of Wisconsin professor Jess Gilbert in an email to PolitiFact. "Certain types of U.S. farming use foreign workers, while others don't." Fruit and vegetable farms used a lot of hired labor. "But these farms are a small proportion of all U.S. farms, the vast majority of which hire no labor and never have. This includes ‘family farms’ in most parts of the country, stereotypically the Midwest," Gilbert said. Paul Conkin, a Vanderbilt history professor emeritus who wrote a book about American agriculture since 1929, said that Rubio’s claim "is either completely wrong or misleading." "Through most of our agricultural history, the workforce largely consisted of farm owners, family members, or one or two hired hands from the neighborhood," he said. "Only since World War II have migratory workers become a major component of farm labor." Many of the professors we interviewed noted that in the South, farms relied on slave labor and later sharecroppers, and many of those people were born in the United States. Columbia University history professor Eric Foner pointed to the Reconstruction period when he said southern plantation owners tried to import foreign workers, including Chinese, to drive down the wages of recently freed blacks. "Very few came -- why go to work as an exploited plantation laborer when jobs were available to immigrants in northern factories?" he said. "This is often the underlying reason for agricultural producers claiming there is a shortage of labor and foreign workers are needed." William and Mary professor Cindy Hahamovitch said Rubio is on the right track, but that some of that immigrant workforce was forced to come here. "In the colonial period most farm laborers would have been European indentured servants and African slaves, especially in the South. After the slave trade ban in 1808 and the Napoleonic Wars, there wasn't much immigration in the early 19th century, but some 30 million Europeans plus Asians and Mexicans arrived in the following century, and many of them would have done farm work." Philip Martin, a University of California professor, co-wrote a paper about migration and farmers that Rubio’s staff cited to us. "Hired workers today are the majority of workers employed in U.S. agriculture, and most were born in Mexico," Martin said. "But especially during the 1930s, most hired workers were U.S.-born, like the Okies and Arkies of Grapes of Wrath days." Our ruling Rubio said that "agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad." There have been certain time periods and types of farms that did use many foreign workers. But Rubio overgeneralized when he suggested that throughout American history, all types of farms needed foreign workers. Farms have also been owner-operated, with little need of a foreign work force.

pomt-08062	Says Texas Republican leaders "have proposed laying off thousands of teachers."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/dec/24/boyd-richie/democratic-chairman-says-republican-leaders-are-ca/	Boyd Richie, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, voiced dismay when an East Texas state representative re-elected as a Democrat in November signaled plans to join the Republican Party. Richie said in a Dec. 13 press release that Rep. Allan Ritter of Nederland would be joining the party "whose leaders have proposed laying off thousands of teachers and slashing the budgets of institutions like Lamar University in Beaumont." The budget guidance to state agencies has been widely reported. For this article, we’re zeroing in on whether GOP leaders have proposed laying off thousands of teachers. Democratic spokeswoman Kirsten Gray pointed to news reports on recommendations that lawmakers ease the longstanding class-size mandate for the five earliest elementary-school grades. On Dec. 8, the Dallas Morning News reported that the Senate Education Committee, chaired by Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, wants the Senate to consider modifying the 22-pupil class-size cap, which is a change championed by state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston. The cap was put in place by lawmakers in a 1984 special session on education that also raised teacher pay and launched the requirement that students pass classes to participate in extracurricular activities. A day later, the newspaper said a fresh recommendation by State Comptroller Susan Combs would require schools to average 22 students in the early grades, compared to the current average of 19.3 students. The News’ story says that with the change, nearly 12,000 elementary teaching jobs would be cut, saving the state $558 million a year. Teacher groups objected. Richard Kouri, spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association, told the News: "It’s no surprise that if you put more kids in classrooms and fire a bunch of teachers, you’ll save money. And you don’t save $558 million a year without firing thousands of elementary school teachers." How did Combs propose teacher layoffs? She didn’t, in so many words. But the comptroller’s December report, Connecting the Dots: School Spending and Student Progress, says the state would save $159 million annually if Kindergarten-Grade 4 class sizes were told to average 20 students or nearly $558 million if the permitted average was 22 students. The report bases the projected savings on the average state salary for K-4 teachers of $46,904. By our math, Combs’ recommendation could eliminate the need for 3,390 to 11,886 teaching positions. Combs’ spokesman, Allen Spelce, didn’t quibble with our math, yet said by e-mail that the recommendation "does not necessarily imply layoffs." Other ways to cut teaching costs without teachers losing jobs: "Enrollment growth could help increase" the average number of students per classroom and "simple (employee) attrition could help too," Spelce said. His e-mail closes: "The recommendation was simply to give districts more local control and flexibility" in tight budget times. Kouri reaffirmed to us there’s no way to achieve big savings without thousands of layoffs though Catherine Clark, an administrator for the Texas Association of School Boards, said there could be layoffs, but not in the thousands, adding that normal attrition in the teaching ranks could soften the impact. Next, we read the Senate panel’s recommendation, which says "options to explore" include modifying class-size limits. The report, signed by the committee’s five Republicans and four Democrats, has no additional details or any indication the committee even favors modification. In an interview, Shapiro agreed that changing the 22-1 ratio could lead to teacher job losses, but she cautioned against assuming that means thousands of layoffs. Shapiro said: "What I hope to see, (districts) will start utilizing those teachers in a different way... Maybe they stop hiring new teachers." Shapiro also said the idea didn’t originate with Republican leaders; school superintendents have sought flexibility in the class-size standard. Spokeswomen Jackie Lain of the school boards’ association and Jenny Caputo of the Texas Association of School Administrators told us districts consider the class-size cap a major cost driver and administrators would welcome more sway over class size. However, neither group has declared a position on changing the law. Lain said how each district handles a revised cap would vary and districts would look for ways to avoid layoffs. "School boards don’t want to fire teachers," she said. Lain, Caputo and other school experts said school enrollment growth, which averaged 2 percent statewide in the decade through 2008-09, affects teacher hirings; so does teacher turnover. Statewide, the number of teachers in public schools increased 5,300 from 2008-09 to 2009-10, according to the Texas Education Agency, whose spokeswoman, Debbie Graves Ratcliffe, said it’s reasonable to assume the additions resulted from increased student enrollment. Teacher turnover averages 12 percent, Ratcliffe said, which for 2009-10 would amount to nearly 40,000 of more than 330,000 teachers. Whew. We ran the fact that no one has directly proposed laying off teachers past the Democratic spokeswoman. Gray replied by e-mail: "Obviously no lawmaker is going to stand up and say ‘we should lay off 12,000 teachers,’ but that is the practical effect of the proposal. If someone proposes an idea that has an understood cost, they must take ownership of not only the idea, but the cost that is inherently tied to it." Our sense: One Republican leader -- Combs -- has recommended that lawmakers ease the class-size limit, which she projects would produce significant savings in teacher salaries. But no one has pitched a proposal calling for thousands of teacher layoffs. That’d be political hari-kari. Nevertheless, it stands to reason that larger classes leads to fewer teachers, which gives Richie’s statement an element of truth. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06743	"The studies have shown us that [drug testing for welfare recipients] will be saving us money"	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/aug/26/doreen-costa/rep-costa-says-drug-testing-welfare-recipients-wil/	Rep. Doreen Costa, of North Kingstown, a Republican and member of the Rhode Island Tea Party, thinks the state could save money by requiring welfare recipients to pass a drug test. She is proposing that Rhode Island adopt a law modeled after one enacted in Florida, which took effect July 1. The law bans recipients who fail a drug test (and a confirmatory test) from receiving cash assistance for a year, unless they successfully complete substance abuse treatment at their own expense. If they complete treatment, they can reapply after six months. If they reapply and fail another drug test, they are banned for three years. The child of someone who fails the test will continue to receive money if the parent designates a family member, such as a grandparent, to handle the funds or if the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) designates a "protective payee." The selected family member must also pass a drug test and be approved by DCF. Recipients would not be tested for alcohol or tobacco use. Costa said the test would cost $25 to $35 per person and recipients would have to pay for it up front. The state would reimburse them if they passed. "The studies have shown us that it will be saving us money, but we don't have the exact amount," Costa said on WHJJ's Helen Glover Show. "If we could save the state $10,000, I'll take it. If we could save them a million, I'll take it. We have to start somewhere." We're not going to examine whether drug screening is a good idea. But we were intrigued by the question of whether there are studies showing that it would save money. For this item, we will look at the prospect of savings in Rhode Island, because Costa told us that’s what she was talking about at the time. We will also examine what studies in other states have concluded when legislators have considered drug-testing their recipients on welfare, formally known as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (TANF). The short answer for Rhode Island is that, under the current system, no state money would be saved because "100 percent of the cash given to TANF recipients is federal money," said Fred Sneesby, spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. Under current law, the federal government doesn't allow Rhode Island to keep any money it saves by denying benefits to people who test positive for drugs, Sneesby said. Nor will the federal government pay for such testing. How much would testing cost the state? We did a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on data supplied by The Rhode Island Poverty Institute. As of May 2011, there were 5,653 adults receiving TANF benefits, including 1,314 from two-parent families and the rest from single-parent families. The cost to the state would depend, in part, on how many people passed, because only those who failed would end up paying for their test. The state would pay for the rest. When Michigan briefly did drug testing for welfare recipients (more about that state's experience later), about 92 percent passed, in part because they knew the test was coming. If Rhode Island recipients passed at the same rate and testing cost $25 to $35 per person, as Costa suggested, that would result in a bill of $130,000 to $182,000 per year. That doesn't include the continuing cost of testing new applicants, doing confirmatory tests to make sure the first test isn't a false positive and any administrative appeals filed by people who wanted to challenge any move to reduce their welfare checks. So what about the studies that, Costa claimed, showed costs savings in other states? When we asked her to pinpoint them, she couldn't cite any. She said she had done her research by going on Ask.com and Google.com and posing the question, "Will drug-testing welfare recipients save money?" We repeated that exercise. Our spot check showed that the top results consisted mostly of blog items, websites and news stories in which various politicians and commentators had asserted -- without real evidence -- that drug screening would save money. However, we did find some studies, but they didn’t support her contention. A 2009 analysis of a proposed drug testing law by Louisiana's Legislative Fiscal Office concluded that testing would save the state $480,373 in denied benefits while costing the state $184,114 for testing and $763,306 for treatment -- a net loss of $467,047. If you strip out the treatment costs -- because Costa's proposal calls for people to pay for their own substance abuse treatment -- the net savings to the Louisiana taxpayer would be $296,259. But Louisiana fiscal analyst Patrice Thomas told us that those calculations were prepared before the state was informed that the federal government would not pay for any of the testing and would not allow the state to keep all of the savings if people were denied benefits. Analyses of bills submitted in 2010 and 2011 showed the drug testing would be a money-loser for the state. The most recent study we found was done in February 2011 by Idaho's Department of Health and Welfare. It estimated that 10 percent of welfare recipients would test positive for drugs and that 25 percent of that group would lose benefits after failing a confirmatory test, saving $1.13 million per year. Idaho also assumed that the state would get to keep $67,905 of the savings. But those savings would be wiped out by the cost of the testing, estimated at $246,591. Thus, for every dollar the state spends in testing, it would get back only 28 cents. In January 2011, Indiana's Office of Fiscal and Management Analysis released an assessment of a drug testing proposal making the rounds in its legislature. It concluded the state would save between $57,000 and $87,000. But that analysis didn't include any administrative costs. (Idaho estimated that for every dollar spent on drug-test costs, the state would need to spend $3.41 on various staff costs.) Even if you assumed that Indiana's extra administrative costs were the same as its testing costs -- $173,000 per year -- that would easily wipe out the savings to the state. Florida isn't the first state to pass a drug testing law for welfare recipients. Michigan adopted one in 1999 but it was put on hold after five weeks because of a court challenge. (About 8 percent of the 268 applicants tested during those five weeks scored positive for illicit drugs. Most had been using marijuana; fewer than 3 percent were found to be using harder drugs.) The law was struck down in 2003 by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that drug testing without probable cause was ruled to be unconstitutional. A similar challenge has been predicted for the Florida law. Arizona does drug testing, but only for people who admit on a written screening test that they have used drugs in the past, gotten into legal trouble because of drugs, or lost or been denied a job because of drugs. That screening test, derided by advocates of chemical testing because it's easy for people to lie, gives the state probable cause to test for drugs, avoiding the constitutional issue. (Among the people who flunked the screening test, 12.5 percent ultimately tested positive for illegal drugs.) Minnesota and Wisconsin do drug testing, but only of convicted drug felons. The Florida law, and the one Costa would like to see passed in Rhode Island, does not call for written screening. To sum up: Costa, when asked about her proposal to test welfare recipients for drugs, didn't predict specific savings for Rhode Island, only that "The studies have shown us that it will be saving us money." But she was unable to produce any studies to back up that claim. The ones we found showed that the costs to the state exceed any savings. And Rhode Island can't save money by kicking people off the welfare rolls because federal funds finance the payments, and the federal government does not allow states to keep money saved through mandatory drug testing. We rate her statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/22c847d7-83db-4053-b621-e27c676778a7	None	Doreen Costa	None	None	None	2011-08-26T08:00:00	2011-08-10	['None']
pomt-10417	When McCain was questioned about hiring lobbyists to his campaign staff, "his top lobbyist actually had the nerve to say, 'The American people won't care about this.' "	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/23/barack-obama/obamas-right-mccains-campaign-said-it-doesnt-matte/	In a speech before 15,000 people in Tampa on May 21, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama said that it was time to get away from "special interest-dominated politics in Washington." He criticized Sen. John McCain for hiring some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his presidential campaign. "And when called on it," Obama said, "his top lobbyist actually had the nerve to say, 'The American people won't care about this.' I think the American people do care about it." Obama didn't say who he was talking about, and his campaign did not respond to clarify. But we think Obama was referring to comments McCain campaign senior adviser Charlie Black made aboard McCain's campaign plane on May 19. Several days prior, the McCain campaign had issued a "conflict policy," which prohibits anyone paid to work for the campaign from being a registered lobbyist. Unpaid volunteers can be lobbyists, but they must list their clients and can't serve on policy committees that deal with issues in which those clients may have an interest. The policy came on the heels of the departure of several high-level campaign officials after embarrassing disclosures about their current or former lobbying activities. Black is himself a former lobbyist (the Washington Post described him as "longtime uber lobbyist"), but he retired from his lobbying firm in March to work full time for the campaign. According to accounts from NBC News and the New York Times, as reporters peppered Black with questions about the debate over former lobbyists working for the campaign, Black responded, "This is complete inside-the-Beltway nonsense." NBC News' Carrie Dann recounted the interview with Black as follows: "Asked today if questions about potential conflicts of interest might be affecting the choices of average American voters, Black responded bluntly: "Hell, no." He was careful to say that Sen. McCain is committed to maintaining the integrity of the campaign — hence his commitment to the re-vetting process. But, Black added, 'I do not believe that average voters out there care.'" Sure sounds like Black was saying he doesn't think the American people care about this issue. We rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-03269	Says some Austin school district classrooms lack electrical outlets.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/aug/08/ramey-ko/prospective-house-candidate-says-austin-school-dis/	A prospective Texas House candidate said some Austin schools shockingly lack a necessity. Ramey Ko, a lawyer who joined candidates for an Austin-area House seat at the July 25, 2013, meeting of the Austin Young Democrats, is not running in the November 2013 special election to serve out the term of Democrat Mark Strama, who resigned. But Ko has said he intends to run in the 2014 Democratic primary. As noted by Austin American-Statesman columnist Ken Herman, Ko said at the meeting: "The very first issue I want to tackle when I'm in the Legislature is public education. Right now in the eastern part of the district in particular we see schools where over half the kids are in portables. We see situations where we may have bought new technology from the bonds that we passed in the past but then we discovered that there are no electrical outlets in the school classrooms because they are over 50 years old. I mean this is literally true. It's amazing when you finally look at the details of this." That does seem amazing. Does the Austin school district have classrooms lacking electrical outlets? Revisiting a board's discussion By telephone, Ko told us he heard about such classrooms at a March 2013 meeting of the board of the Greater Austin Asian Chamber of Commerce in which board members discussed Austin school bond propositions on the May 2013 ballot. Ko said board member Catherine Crago said that some district schools "average" 0.5 outlets per classroom and, Ko said, Crago added that this means some classrooms have no outlets. Ko said he is an advisory board member of the chamber. By phone and email, Crago told us that at the meeting, she mentioned research she helped compile in the early 1990s that inventoried some five million square feet of Central Texas schools, counting among features each school’s windows and outlets. Crago said she did not say that she was referring to classrooms in the Austin district. Precisely, Crago said, she told board members that the research showed some Central Texas schools with 10 outlets per classroom and others averaging 0.5 outlets per classroom. She said she then asked an Austin district representative at the meeting: "Is that still true?" Crago said the representative nodded yes, which could have been in reference to Central Texas schools rather than Austin schools alone. Crago said her broader judgment is that older classrooms lack sufficient infrastructure to handle several computers in addition to a teacher's equipment. Did the Austin district official at that meeting agree that some classrooms lack outlets? That’s not the recollection of Perla Delgado, the district representative at the chamber’s board meeting, Alex Sanchez, a district spokesman, told us by phone. Delgado "did not remember any specific question that she received or answered about electrical outlets," Sanchez said. "It’s not something she said that even came up." Separately, the executive director of the chamber, Marina Bhargava, said by phone that there was extensive discussion of the bond proposals at the meeting. She said she didn’t recall the electrical outlet moment, though such an exchange might well have happened. Austin district says classrooms have multiple outlets Recollections aside, do Austin classrooms lack outlets? Sanchez and other district officials said not. District spokesman Antonio Lujan said by email that there have been no classrooms lacking outlets for years. "Even the district's oldest schools and portables would have several outlets in a room designated as a classroom," Lujan said. "A classroom could not function without electrical outlets, and staff members would request to add them to accommodate the teaching environment." Lujan passed along a response from Jeff Kauffman, the district’s director of construction management, stating that every classroom has an outlet. "For new construction, every type of classroom, (from basic elementary school general-use classrooms to specialized computer classrooms in high school) has a minimum number of outlets (electrical and computer) required to fully operate the space as defined" in the district’s educational specifications, Kauffman said. Kauffman said the specifications for a basic elementary school classroom (the least-wired situation) calls for a minimum of six electrical outlets with separate dedicated outlets (three to five) for computers..." Kauffman said that more "technology-based" classrooms would have more outlets. "Older classrooms," Kauffman said, "have had outlets added, as needed, to accommodate the use of the space." Also, he said, new "classroom portables have a minimum of eight electrical outlets and six data connections per classroom. Older portables have had outlets added, as needed," Kauffman said. Sanchez later said that according to Paul Turner, the district’s executive director of facilities, the typical district classroom has about six outlets, each of them enabling two plugs. Also, according to Turner, each classroom on average would have six "drops," meaning electrical cables enabling multiple connections such as those needed for laptops. Sanchez said voters provided for the "drops" by approving a 1996 bond proposition. We shared the district’s replies with Ko, who said by email that the average number of outlets "doesn't really speak to whether certain schools currently have classrooms that either lack working or usable outlets for whatever reasons." He also said that he apologizes if what he thought he heard was incorrect. Our ruling Ko said some Austin classrooms lack electrical outlets. We see no basis for this statement, which shakes out as horse-and-buggy ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Ramey Ko	None	None	None	2013-08-08T10:00:00	2013-07-25	['None']
pomt-09578	"For the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/white-house-visitor-logs-voluntarily-released-pote/	During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama talked about the importance of restoring trust in government. To close the credibility gap, Obama said, "we must take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work openly; and to give our people the government they deserve." "That's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online," he said. We've been looking into the question of White House visitor logs. It's true that the Obama administration is releasing more information on White House visitors than any previous administration and posting those details to the Web. But the story is more complicated than that. And as we've noted before with this administration, you have to read the fine print because it includes some loopholes. When Obama first took office, the administration did not immediately release information on White House visitors, and it refused records requests from the news Web site msnbc.com and the advocacy organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. CREW filed suit for the records in July 2009, and by September, the White House announced its intention to release some of the logs in a settlement with CREW. Starting Sept. 15, 2009, the White House said it would release records of all visitors, but the records would be released 90 to 120 days after the visits occurred. But the administration outlined a series of exceptions for records that would not be released: • personal information such as dates of birth, Social Security numbers or phone numbers • information that would be of concern to law enforcement or a threat to national security interests • personal guests of the president and vice president and their families ("i.e., visits that do not involve any official or political business") • records related to a "small group of particularly sensitive meetings (e.g., visits of potential Supreme Court nominees). The White House will disclose each month the number of records withheld on this basis, and it will release such records once they are no longer sensitive." It's that last point that stuck out to us. They'll release all the records unless the record is "particularly sensitive." That seems like a standard that can encompass an awful lot. CREW first filed suit against the Bush administration in 2006 for the White House visitor logs. Because White House records are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, the group argued that they belonged to the Secret Service and could be released under FOIA. A federal judge agreed with CREW in 2007, but left the records sealed pending appeal. The settlement with the Obama administration stopped that process. CREW says it still believes that the records are subject to FOIA but that it chose to settle because "the administration agreed to go much farther than we had asked in court: rather than just providing documents about specific visits upon request, the administration is posting the records of nearly all White House visitors," according to an e-mail to PolitiFact from CREW executive director Melanie Sloan. It's worth noting CREW's founder was Norm Eisen, who now is Obama's special counsel for ethics and government reform. He joined the administration in January 2009 and wrote the blog post announcing the new records policy. Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning organization that has sued both Democratic and Republican administrations, isn't satisfied with the settlement and has filed suit to force the release of all the logs. "The problem with these exemptions is that they're just exemptions that (the White House is) making up," said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. "By their own admission, they're not releasing everything." Some open government organizations have nevertheless praised the administration's move. It's a "huge step toward a more transparent government," said Ellen Miller of the Sunlight Foundation, writing on the group's Web site. Mentioning the exemptions, she said, "We are going to trust them to make the right decisions. ... One misstep and the goodwill we are offering them right now goes out the window." So far, the White House has released one month of visitor logs. An Obama administration spokesman said that so far, it has not withheld any records for political sensitivity. A few records are still being processed for national security concerns, according to the White House Web site. Getting back to Obama's statement, he said, "For the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online." He's right that the release was unprecedented -- there is no dispute that the Obama administration has released more information from the logs than any previous administration. But there is still a gap for roughly the first nine months that Obama was in office. And the administration has given itself a significant loophole with the exemption for sensitivity, especially given that there's already a substantial delay built into the release. So while he's opened the records and earned praise from open-government advocates, it's not quite as sweeping as he suggests. We find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-14507	"Drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/22/maggie-hassan/governor-maggie-hassan-says-drug-overdoses-are-sec/	During her recent State of the State address, Gov. Maggie Hassan dropped a startling statistic about New Hampshire’s opioid problem. "Drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire," said the two-term Democrat. "Today, more Granite Staters are killed by overdoses than by diabetes, breast cancer or motor vehicle accidents." Much has been reported about the rapid rise of drug overdose deaths in New Hampshire. More than 400 people died from a drug overdose in 2015, up from 326 overdose deaths in 2014, and 192 in 2013. The issue has taken a role in the 2016 presidential contest. During a recent ABC News Republican debate, moderator David Muir cited Hassan’s claim. But are overdoses now the second leading cause of death in the state, beating out diabetes, breast cancer and motor vehicle accidents? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to have a look at the numbers. Hassan’s camp cited a chart created by New Futures, a statewide advocacy organization that focuses on substance abuse. The bar chart, titled "In Perspective -- New Hampshire Deaths," stacks up drug deaths against other mortality statistics from 2014. Drug overdose deaths rank second in the chart, behind Alzheimer's disease, which led to 351 deaths in 2014. Those two causes of deaths are followed by diabetes (310), flu and pneumonia (226), kidney disease (175), breast cancer (170), motor vehicle deaths (138) and a host of other cancers. The slide, however, doesn’t include every cause of death, and leaves out several conditions that led to far more deaths than drug overdoses and alzheimer's disease in 2014. Heart disease caused 2,464 New Hampshire deaths in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During the same year, Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease and stroke killed 680 and 474 Granite Staters respectively, the CDC reported. The point of the slide, however, is not to rank causes of death, but rather to contrast similar mortality causes and put drug deaths into perspective, according to New Futures spokesman Joe Gallagher. "The slide does not attempt to rank drug overdoses as the second leading common cause of death in New Hampshire, nor does the slide account for all causes of death in the state," he said in an email. So, where exactly do drug overdoses stand among causes of death? It depends on how one classifies mortality rates. While the New Futures slide breaks out different forms of cancer, for example, the CDC lumps all cancer data together and names the disease the leading cause of death in New Hampshire. All forms of the cancer killed nearly 2,700 people in the state 2014. Heart disease followed cancer as the second leading cause of death in New Hampshire, according to the CDC data. "Accidents" -- which includes things like car crashes and drug overdoses -- ranked third, and left 716 people dead in 2014. Even if one breaks out different forms of cancer and heart disease, the leading causes of death in those categories still outnumbered drug overdose deaths in 2014, according to the New Hampshire Division of Vital Records Administration. Lung cancer was the underlying cause of 730 New Hampshire deaths in 2014. Atherosclerotic heart disease led to 687 deaths in the state that same year, according to division statistician Nicholl Marshall. Hassan went on to cite specific conditions that drug overdoses have surpassed, including diabetes, breast cancer or motor vehicle accidents. New Futures pointed us to data from the American Cancer Society, which shows breast cancer killed an estimated 170 Granite Staters in 2014, far fewer than the 326 killed by drug overdoses. Diabetes killed 300 people in New Hampshire during 2014, according to the CDC, again fewer than the state’s drug deaths that year. And, finally, motor vehicle accidents accounted for 102 deaths in 2014, according to the New Hampshire office of the chief medical examiner. Our ruling New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan said, "Drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire." Drug deaths are a growing cause of death in the state, and have certainly outpaced car accidents, diabetes and breast cancer, the three examples Hassan cited. But overdoses are not the second leading cause of death, still falling behind heart disease, stroke, and a host of other ailments. We rate her claim False.

pomt-12242	"Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer" attributed to marijuana.	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/jul/13/john-morgan/lawsuit-against-florida-john-morgan-says-no-report/	John Morgan, the lawyer who spearheaded Florida’s 2016 constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana use, says that the Legislature has ignored the will of the voters by banning smoking it. In November, about 71 percent of Florida voters approved the medical marijuana amendment. To implement the new law, the Legislature passed a provision that defines medical use to exclude smoking marijuana. Morgan filed a lawsuit July 6 asking the Leon County Circuit Court to declare the Legislature’s provision unenforceable. He says that while the amendment allows the Legislature to ban smoking in public, it does not allow it to ban smoking in general. In the lawsuit, Morgan made some claims about the benefits of marijuana and then said this: "Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer or emphysema attributed to marijuana." There have been people who smoked marijuana who had lung cancer, but that in itself doesn’t tell us if marijuana caused the cancer. We found some evidence to support Morgan’s statement, but the research comes with significant caveats and experts say more research is needed to reach more definitive conclusions. (Morgan also mentioned emphysema, but we will focus here on cancer.) A report found no statistical association but called for more research Ben Pollara, who worked with Morgan on the amendment, sent us multiple articles related to research on cancer and marijuana. The most comprehensive information comes from a January 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The report was written by a committee of experts who reviewed studies since 1999 regarding health effects of using cannabis and cannabis-derived products related to various diseases including lung cancer. In the section on lung cancer, the researchers looked at research and concluded: "There is moderate evidence of no statistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of lung cancer." However the committee also noted that the studies it reviewed -- and research in general about marijuana -- had limitations: • A 2015 study published in the journal Cancer pooled data on 2,159 lung cancer cases. This study found no statistically significant association between smoking cannabis and lung cancer incidence including for a subgroup of study participants who were not tobacco smokers. However, the study noted that "the possibility of potential adverse effect for heavy consumption cannot be excluded." The study relied on patients’ self-reporting about their use of cannabis. • In 2015, the American Association for Cancer Research published an epidemiologic review. One study evaluated lung cancer risk among 49,321 Swedish military conscripts over a 40-year period and found they had a statistically significant risk of developing lung cancer compared with those who didn’t use cannabis. However, the report noted several gaps related to the Swedish study, which the author has acknowledged. Overall, the National Academies report called for more research about marijuana and health effects while noting several barriers, including that it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance and that researchers often find it difficult to gain access to the quantity, quality, and type of cannabis product necessary to address specific research questions. American Cancer Society says it is difficult to assess impact Pollara also pointed to information on the American Cancer Society website that listed marijuana in a section on factors with uncertain or unproven effects on lung cancer risk. The ACS states that there are some reasons to think that smoking marijuana might increase lung cancer risk, including that marijuana smoke contains tar. However, it also explains that it’s difficult to research the impact of marijuana since the use has been illegal in many places for a long time, and many lung cancer patients have smoked marijuana and tobacco, making it difficult to attribute causes. "More research is needed to know the cancer risks from smoking marijuana," ACS states. Many experts we reached echoed the sentiment that additional research is needed. Harvard Medical School professor Bertha K. Madras reviewed multiple studies and her conclusion was similar to the National Academies report that there didn’t appear to be an association. However, Madras expressed caution about reaching conclusions. "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," she told PolitiFact. "Data are old. Currently we have more persons smoking high potency marijuana daily than years ago, when most studies were collecting data." A 2016 literature review written by University of Tampa health sciences professor Mary Martinasek showed that while some studies indicated an increased risk of lung cancer, others found no such link or a lower risk for lung cancer. "There is little evidence to support statistical associations either for or against cannabis and lung cancer," she said. "We need more research to confirm or deny an association." Dr. Suzanne Sisley, who is an expert witness for Morgan and is doing an FDA approved trial related to marijuana and PTSD, said that the federal government has sought for decades to prove smoking marijuana caused lung cancer and has been unable to do so. Our ruling Morgan said, "Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer" attributed to marijuana. The most comprehensive analysis about the health effects related to cannabis comes from a 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences. The report found "moderate evidence of no statistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of lung cancer." However, the report also noted various limitations of the research. Overall, the academies called for more research -- a sentiment shared by other experts we interviewed. Morgan’s statement is partially accurate, but more evidence is needed before definitely declaring smoking marijuana is risk-free when it comes to lung cancer. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-03690	"The sex-offender registry has been around for a long time, and the research that's out there says that it has no positive impact on the public safety."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/22/ohio-public-defenders-office/ohio-public-defenders-office-says-sex-offender-reg/	Ohio will begin tracking arsonists this summer through a new registry similar to the one used to track sex offenders. A law passed last year by the General Assembly will require people convicted of arson-related offenses to register at their local sheriff's office each year for at least 10 years. Failing to register will be a felony. Supporters tout the measure as a tool for law enforcement. Critics argue, among other points, that the registry will be a burden for sheriffs already charged with keeping the sex-offender registry. "The sex-offender registry has been around for a long time, and the research that's out there says that it has no positive impact on the public safety," Amy Borror, spokeswoman for the Ohio Public Defender's Office, told The Plain Dealer. "And, if anything, it might have a negative impact on public safety because it creates this administrative burden." The registry has been around for almost 20 years and has been public for more than 15. The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Act, enacted by Congress in 1994, required convicted sex offenders to record their address with local law enforcement. Megan’s Law, added in 1996, allowed the information to be given directly to the public. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), passed in 2006, set registration standards that widened the reach of registration for the entire nation. PolitiFact Ohio knew the subject could be an emotional one. We asked Borror how the claim is supported that the registry does not improve public safety. She referred us first to the website of the Public Defender's Office, which links to a number of reports, and to a special issue of the peer-reviewed journal Criminal Justice and Behavior, from May 2010, which was dedicated to sex offender issues. Criminal Justice and Behavior published 10 academic studies related to sex offenses, focusing on the question of whether public policies concerning sex offenders enhance the safety of children and communities. The journal found that the subject is consistently one of the leading policy issues on legislative agendas. It concluded, however, that "sex offender policies are often inconsistent with empirical evidence about sex offender risks, recidivism, reintegration and supervision.... "Legislators cite the news media and the views of their constituents -- not research evidence -- as their primary sources of information about sex offenses and offenders," the journal said. One of the published studies, by criminologists with the University of Massachusetts, Lynn University and the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice, focused on Ohio and Oklahoma, two of the first states to meet federal guidelines set by SORNA. Those guidelines classify offenders into one of three categories determined by solely by convicted offense. (Previously, judges determined what risk offenders posed and assigned them to one of three registration categories.) Drawing on data from more than 28,000 cases in Ohio and from other research, the study’s conclusions "shed doubt on the public safety utility of the SORNA classification system." It found that a disproportionate number of offenders were classified as high risk, placing greater burdens, perhaps unnecessarily, on law enforcement personnel and budgets. "From a public safety perspective," the study found, the SORNA classification guidelines hurt the ability of the system "to effectively discriminate between those who pose a substantial risk to society and those who pose minimal risk," and also contradict evidence about the risk of repeat offenses for both adult sex offenders and juveniles. Another report, from the Minnesota Department of Corrections, studied sexual offenders who were jailed for failing to register with local law enforcement agencies. It found that the failure to register was not a predictor of repeated crime, other than future failure to register. An analysis of adult arrest data from 1990 to 2005 in South Carolina found that sex offender registration laws did have a deterrent effect on first-time adult offenders, but no effect on juveniles and no effect on recidivism. Borror also pointed us to a 2009 study from the state of New York’s Office of Mental Health that specifically compares a risk-based classification system (which Ohio used to have) to the offense-based registration system, which Ohio has now. It concluded that the current system "falls short of increasing public safety," citing five earlier studies that found registration and notification laws were "ineffective methods of reducing sexual victimizations." It also noted there is evidence that such laws actually lead to more criminal behavior by aggravating the factors linked to it -- an unintended consequence of reducing or denying employment, educational, social and housing opportunities. "Although well intended, such laws have done little (if anything) to increase public safety and may in fact be lowering it," the study said. (A 2007 report by the non-government organization Human Rights Watch detailed the harassment of registered offenders because of online community notification.) We looked further and found a 2008 report funded by the U.S. Justice Department examining the original Megan's Law in New Jersey. "Despite widespread community support for these laws," it said, "there is virtually no evidence to support their effectiveness in reducing either new first-time sex offenses (through protective measures or general deterrence) or sex re-offenses (through protective measures and specific deterrence). "Given the lack of demonstrated effect of Megan’s Law on sexual offenses, the growing costs may not be justifiable," it said. Another study, by J.J. Prescott of the University of Michigan Law School and Jonah Rockoff of Columbia Business School and the National Bureau of Economic Research, examined data from 15 states over more than 10 years. They found that registering sex offenders does reduce sex crime, especially among victims with a personal connection to offenders, most likely because of better police monitoring. They also found, however, that making the registry information available to the public has the opposite effect and increases crime. "There is little evidence of a decrease in crimes against strangers," the study said. "We also find evidence that community notification deters crime, but in a way unanticipated by legislators. Our results suggest that community notification deters first-time sex offenders, but may increase recidivism by registered offenders by increasing the relative attractiveness of criminal behavior. This finding is consistent with work by criminologists showing that notification may contribute to recidivism by imposing social and financial costs on registered sex offenders and, as a result, making non-criminal activity relatively less attractive. "We regard this latter finding as potentially important, given that the purpose of community notification is the reduction of recidivism," the authors concluded. The federal Government Accountability Office evaluated the effects of SORNA in a report issued earlier this year. The GAO noted that law’s purpose is to protect the public from sex offenders, but found "analysis of the act’s effect on public safety has been limited." Positive effects included "improved monitoring of registered sex offenders" and better information sharing between law enforcement agencies. Negative consequences found by the GAO included a lack of consideration of the risk of repeating sexual offenses in classifying offenders; a disproportionate increase in the workload of law enforcement agencies, and increased problems for registered sex offenders to find work or housing. What conclusion can we draw about Borror’s statement for the Ohio Public Defender’s Office, that research shows the sex offender registry has no positive impact? We found that research has been done generally on the effectiveness of sex offender registration and notification laws. We found that studies indicate the laws have no clear effect on recidivism, or repeat offenses, which is their intended target, and are ineffective in assessing and managing risk. Although there is some indication that registration and community notification may deter first-time adult offenders, the studies find that the deterrence doesn’t extend to juveniles -- and that community notification likely increases repeat sex crimes and other crimes. With that information needed for clarification, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Ohio Public Defender's Office	None	None	None	2013-04-22T06:00:00	2013-04-12	['None']
pomt-02594	U.S. Rep. John Barrow, D-Ga., does not want to audit the Federal Reserve.	false	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/28/rick-allen/past-votes-contradict-candidates-claim/	A tweet has some feathers flyin’ between a Georgia congressman and a candidate who wants his job. At issue, U.S. Rep. John Barrow’s position on auditing the Federal Reserve. Rick Allen, a Republican running against the Augusta Democrat, posted a message on his Twitter page about Barrow. "You want to #AuditTheFED? @RepJohnBarrow doesn't," the tweet read. True? "This is probably as big a lie as you can get from Rick Allen," Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo said in one email. " ‘Audit the Fed’ is yet another example of John Barrow trying to be on both sides of the issue," said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Allen. Barrow represents one of the few swing congressional districts in Georgia, and Republicans have been unsuccessful in beating him despite great efforts in recent election cycles. Barrow is the only white Democrat from the Deep South currently serving in the House. So who’s right here? PolitiFact Georgia decided to find out. First, a little background. The Federal Reserve helps set national monetary policy, and its decisions have great influence on Wall Street and the world economy. A movement to audit the Federal Reserve, commonly called the Fed, gained momentum in 2009 after the financial crisis a year earlier. Lawmakers wanted to examine the Fed’s emergency lending to financial institutions in the months leading up to and after the crisis. At its peak, the Fed's lending totaled $1.16 trillion, according to news accounts. One of the leaders of the Audit the Fed movement was U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, a now-retired House member from Texas who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008 and 2012. Paul introduced a bill in February 2009 to conduct an audit. Called the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009, House Resolution 1207 would politicize their work, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke countered. "(W)hat is so outrageous is that the Federal Reserve can literally deal in trillions of dollars," Paul said on the House floor in May 2010. "They don't get the money authorized. They don't get the money appropriated. They just create it, and they get involved in bailing out their friends." Paul’s legislation had been inserted into a House version of a bill involving the regulating of Wall Street that he boasted at the time had more than 300 sponsors. One of those co-sponsors was Barrow, McLagan noted. McLagan pointed to a vote by Barrow on the bill on June 30, 2010, to support his candidate’s claim. Barrow voted against what is described in federal records as "a motion to recommit a conference report with instructions." "(Barrow) co-sponsored the bill, then voted against it. That is John Barrow in a nutshell -- everything is half true because he supports both sides of every issue," McLagan said. "He is tailor-made for PolitiFact." Congress defines a motion to recommit with instructions as one final chance to amend a bill before it is passed by the full House of Representatives. The motion included language to audit the Fed that was similar to what Paul had proposed a year earlier, according to a pro-Ron Paul website. Eight minutes later, the House passed, with Barrow’s support, a financial industry bill that had been agreed upon a day earlier by House and Senate lawmakers. Paul supporters said the 2,000-page bill had a "watered-down audit provision" limited to loans made by the Fed during the height of the economic crisis. Carbo, Barrow’s spokesman, explained the vote against the motion to recommit. "[T]he main purpose of an MTR is to send the bill back to the Committee of jurisdiction, effectively killing the bill. Mr. Barrow, was already in support of the bill (which included audit language), so it would have been counterproductive to send it back to Committee when negotiators had already come to an agreement," Carbo said via email. "The MTR, in addition to ‘killing’ the underlying bill, made some other changes that weren't clear at the moment of the vote." Two years later, Paul tried again. In July 2012, the House voted 327-98 in favor of a bill he titled the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2012. Barrow had signed on to the bill as a co-sponsor in July 2011, and he voted in favor of the legislation. The bill was forwarded to the Senate, but no vote was taken there, records show. In January 2013, another Georgia House member philosophically tied to Paul introduce another bill to audit the Fed. This was one filed by U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens. Barrow is one of 181 House members who co-sponsored the bill. The legislation, though, has not come up for a vote in the House. McLagan insisted his candidate’s Twitter post was correct, citing the 2010 vote. McLagan said Barrow was slow in co-sponsoring the subsequent legislation to audit the Federal Reserve. In short, McLagan said, Barrow is not truly committed to auditing the Fed. "He’s on both sides of every issue," McLagan said repeatedly of Barrow. To sum up, Allen’s Twitter page posted a claim that Barrow does not want to audit the Federal Reserve. Barrow, though, has co-sponsored and voted for legislation in favor of an audit. We rate Allen’s claim False.	None	Rick Allen	None	None	None	2014-01-28T00:00:00	2014-01-10	['United_States', 'Federal_Reserve_System']
pomt-06537	Says Gov. Chris Christie "cut spending (by) $1 billion" and provided "$850 million in new education funding."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/06/committee-our-childrens-future/television-ad-promotes-chris-christies-spending-cu/	If you believe what you see on television, Gov. Chris Christie is a ray of sunshine in a dark and dreary world. A television ad broadcast in recent weeks by a group of Christie supporters paints that image of the governor, while touting his achievements of cutting spending and increasing education funding. From a group called the Committee for Our Children’s Future, the ad begins with a hazy image of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. as the narrator intones: "Runaway spending, record debt, gridlock government. Washington is backwards." Then suddenly, the video turns to an image of a sunrise with the narrator telling us who’s responsible: "But Chris Christie, with bipartisan support, is taking New Jersey (in) another direction." The ad goes on to claim Christie "cut spending (by) $1 billion" and provided "$850 million in new education funding." PolitiFact New Jersey found that the group’s numbers are technically correct, but the picture is less sunny when you examine the education funding changes over the course of Christie’s tenure. Let’s start with that $1 billion in spending cuts. The $1 billion in spending cuts mentioned in the ad refers to the line-item vetoes made by Christie in response to a $30.6 billion budget approved in June by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. With his line-item vetoes, Christie reduced the fiscal year 2012 budget to nearly $29.7 billion. So the group is right that he cut spending by about $1 billion from what the Legislature had approved. Despite that decrease, the fiscal year 2012 budget is still larger than the fiscal year 2011 budget that Christie signed in June 2010. The fiscal year 2012 budget is about $1.3 billion greater than the fiscal year 2011 budget approved last year. David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, said that $1.3 billion -- most of which represents a pension payment and increased school aid -- was made possible by higher-than-anticipated revenue growth in fiscal year 2011 and projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2012. Now, let’s turn to the "$850 million in new education funding" mentioned in the ad. In a previous ruling, we noted how the fiscal year 2012 budget increases education funding by about $863 million over the prior fiscal year. That figure supports the group’s claim, but there’s two problems with that argument. First, about half of that increased aid -- more than $446 million -- was required as part of a court order to go to the so-called Abbott districts. So Christie didn’t have a choice about that money. Secondly, the fiscal year 2011 budget cut education aid by about $829 million. That means the new budget only represents a net increase of about $30 million. In a Sept. 8 interview on an online radio show hosted by the New Jersey School Boards Association, Christie backs up that analysis: "Yes, in my first year, we had to cut $820 million in funding from the public schools because we were in an enormous fiscal crisis. But the next year, this budget that I just signed...and advocated for, put an additional $850 million into the budget for public schools. So it paid back the entire cut from the year before of $820 million and added an additional $30 million on top of that." Brian Jones, a spokesman for Committee for Our Children’s Future, defended both statements in an email. "Christie did wind up cutting $1 billion in spending, as you note below, so I don’t see how the statement can be seen as being false," Jones said. "Again, Christie did wind up increasing education funding by $850 million this year. It’s a true statement." Our ruling A television ad from a pro-Christie group claims the governor "cut spending (by) $1 billion" and provided "$850 million in new education funding." Those numbers are accurate, but when it comes to the education funding, Committee for Our Children’s Future must think New Jerseyans only have short-term memory. Given the cuts made last year, education funding has gone up by a total of about $30 million since Christie’s first budget in office. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-09273	The more than $800,000 raised by the Alan Grayson campaign last quarter was "#1 among all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives."	false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/29/alan-grayson/grayson-said-he-was-no-1-was-no-3/	Alan Grayson, a Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives representing central Florida, is a prolific fundraiser. He recently trumpeted his success in an e-mail to supporters on April 26, 2010. Grayson wrote: "Our Grayson for Congress campaign raised over $800,000 last quarter, from almost 25,000 contributors. That was #1 among all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives." We're always curious when we hear someone claim to be No. 1 in anything, so we looked into it. The Grayson campaign was slow in getting back to us with data to back up the claim, so we examined at Grayson's report on the Federal Election Commission website for the most recent quarter that ended March 31, 2010. We found he raised $809,111.83 in net contributions. We went to the Center for Responsive Politics site OpenSecrets.org and looked at a chart of the top 10 fundraisers for this current election cycle for candidates for the House of Representatives. On that list, Grayson is No. 6. We ran those 10 names -- which include eight incumbents and two other candidates -- through the FEC database to examine reports for the most recent fundraising quarter. The result: Grayson was third behind two Republican members of the House -- Eric Cantor of Virginia at $831,851.79 and Michele Bachmann of Minnesota at $810,991.74. The Federal Election Commission sent us a list of the top 10 fundraisers among candidates in the House for the most recent quarter. For incumbents, Grayson came in third behind Cantor and Bachmann. We showed the figures we found for Cantor and Bachmann to Grayson's office and asked how the campaign concluded that he was No. 1. Julie Tagen, senior advisor to the campaign, then acknowledged to us an in an e-mail that he was "not number one last quarter.'' But she added that, "Although we were not number one last quarter, we are number one in the past two quarters combined," wrote Julie Tagen, senior advisor to the campaign. "We were among the top fundraisers, and no campaign claims to have more donors than us. That makes us number one in the context of what we were discussing." We don't believe there is sufficient public data for a campaign to prove her latest claim. Comparing the number of donors is a difficult task -- in part because donors who give less than $200 don't have to be reported. That would require calling all of the members of the House and asking for their donor lists -- something they would be hesitant to provide. We doubt the Grayson campaign had time to do that. But back to the claim we're checking: Grayson said in an e-mail to his supporters that he was "#1 among all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives." We proved he was wrong because at least two others raised more, and his campaign has acknowledged the claim is not accurate. We find it False.

pomt-00424	"Black business ownership jumped 400% in one year."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/27/blog-posting/black-business-ownership-didnt-increase-400-percen/	Conservative bloggers are championing a survey that they say indicates a 400 percent jump in the number of black-owned businesses in the United States in the past year — and they’re attributing that supposed increase to President Donald Trump. Trump has pointed to low African-American unemployment rates throughout his presidency, calling them "the lowest ever recorded in our country." While that’s true, we found African-American unemployment has been decreasing gradually since it peaked at 16.6 percent in 2010. This new claim of a skyrocketing number of black business owners originates from a 2017 client email survey conducted by two private companies and focused on small businesses. The aggregated findings, posted on the companies’ websites in January, do not reference Trump. However, bloggers then took the survey and linked the results to Trump. For example, the conservative website Think Americana published an article titled, "MAGA: Black business ownership jumps 400% in one year under Trump." "On Monday President Trump’s approval rating with African Americans hit 31%," the article said. "That’s not all. Black business ownership jumped 400% in one year." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The 31 percent approval rating comes from a recent Rasmussen Reports poll, which was updated a few days later as 36 percent. Rasmussen Reports consistently cites higher approval ratings for Trump than most pollsters. Gallup’s numbers hover in the 10 to 15 percent approval range for African-Americans, and Reuters monthly polling for July had black approval at 12.8 percent. In November 2017, small business financing company Guidant Financial and online credit marketplace LendingClub Corporation sent out an email survey to their clientele nationwide; they received responses from about 2,600 "current and aspiring entrepreneurs." The companies both posted general articles about the results of that survey on their websites in January without making any distinctions about race or ethnicity except that 47 percent of "aspiring entrepreneurs" surveyed were minorities. The 400 percent increase in black-owned businesses claim, however, was not made until a subsequent graphic was published on Guidant’s website on Aug. 8. It was not clear from the released results how the companies came up with the 400 percent jump. The percentage of African-American respondents who owned businesses was not published, nor was that figure from last year. The survey sample was not random, the response was voluntary, and the margin of error was not made public. This graphic said it relied on the same survey data, and it highlighted the African-American business owners in the pool. The methodology the companies provided did not break down respondents by race, only saying that minorities accounted for 47 percent of aspiring entrepreneurs who responded. PolitiFact contacted Guidant about the claim in the graphic on Aug. 21. Two days later, a new version of the graphic was posted, this time without any mention of a 400 percent increase. "We have found that the 400% statistic is being misrepresented in its context and therefore we have decided to pull that statistic from our info graph," public relations consultant for Guidant Stacia Kirby said in an email. "Our mission is to help people get started and funded in owning their own business." When it comes to black-owned business numbers, we couldn’t find another source that supports this increase from 2017 to 2018. The Annual Business Survey data about Business Owner Characteristics for 2017 is not yet available, and most recent census data related to minority-owned businesses is from 2016. Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz, studies entrepreneurship and authored a book about its relationship with race in the United States. Fairlie said there was no indication that African-American businesses had seen significant growth in the past year. "That would be great if there was a 400 percent increase given that African-American rates are so low, but everything that I have seen from Census and BLS data does not show that kind of growth," Fairlie said. Because of the small sample size and lack of corroborating data, we rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-08-27T10:09:58	2018-08-20	['None']
pomt-14652	"Blue Cross Blue Shield cancelled all their individual (health care) policies in the state of Texas, effective Dec. 31."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/jan/22/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-ridiculously-says-blue-cross-blue-shield-/	Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz revealed at a campaign stop that he lately lacks health coverage because, he proclaimed, an insurance provider governed by the Obamacare law announced it was ditching the Texas market. According to a video snippet of Cruz’s Jan. 21, 2016, Manchester, N.H., remarks, emailed to reporters by the Democratic National Committee, Cruz followed up general criticisms of the 2010 law requiring most Americans to have health coverage by saying: "I’ll tell you, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who has lost their health care because of Obamacare? That would be me. "I don’t have health care right now," Cruz said. "I had purchased an individual policy and Blue Cross Blue Shield cancelled all their individual policies in the state of Texas, effective Dec. 31. So our health care got cancelled. We got a notice in the mail, Blue Cross Blue Shield was leaving the market. And so we’re in the process of finding another" policy. The day we published this fact check, Cruz’s campaign separately said Cruz hadn’t realized when he spoke in New Hampshire that after Dec. 31, 2015, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas shifted Cruz’s family from the policy it was losing to an HMO plan. Bloomberg News quoted Catherine Frazier, a Cruz campaign spokeswoman, saying: "On December 31, Blue Cross cancelled the PPO health insurance policy covering the Cruz family. That plan was purchased on the individual market, using a private insurance broker, with no government funds. At the time, the broker informed Sen. Cruz that the plan was being cancelled. The broker did not inform him that Blue Cross had automatically enrolled the family in another policy, an HMO with far more limited coverage. Based on this information, Sen. Cruz believed the family was uninsured and asked the broker to pull quotes immediately for a new policy. Frazier further said Cruz's family is currently covered by a Blue Cross HMO but planned to be covered by a Humana PPO effective March 1. A Politico news story on Cruz’s Manchester remarks said that in 2015, Cruz and his wife, Heidi, on temporary leave from her job with Goldman Sachs, had purchased an individual plan after previously receiving coverage through the Wall Street firm. For this article, we looked into Cruz’s claim that Blue Cross Blue Shield stopped selling health coverage in Texas at the end of 2015, leaving the market, as Cruz put it. Not so, we found, and the "notice" Cruz mentioned in New Hampshire may have been sent his way a couple months before the year ended, leaving time to consider options. July 2015 announcement We didn’t hear back from Cruz about the basis of his statement. Meantime, the insurer in summer 2015 did announce changes to its Texas offerings. According to a July 2015 Austin American-Statesman news story, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas said it would offer fewer health insurance plans when open enrollment began in the fall on the online marketplace mandated under the Obamacare law, which Cruz has vowed to repeal and replace. At the time, the insurer’s chief medical officer, Dan McCoy, said preferred provider organization, or PPO, plans would not be affordable in 2016, and the company wouldn’t continue to make them available. McCoy also said the company would continue to offer health maintenance organization, or HMO, plans. An HMO requires enrolled patients to pick a primary care physician through which the patient and family members obtain all but emergency services, sometimes by referral. Visits to health care professionals outside of the HMO network typically aren’t covered. PPO plans give more flexibility; you don’t need a primary physician and can go to any health care professional without a referral inside or outside its network, though it costs less to stay in the network. Costs cited Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas’ July 23, 2015, announcement said it had been "the only insurer to offer an individual PPO insurance plan across the state to individuals in 2014 and 2015. Since the Affordable Care Act began," it said, "the market has changed." The company further said it couldn’t simply offer the PPO option at higher rates, saying: "The law requires that we set our individual plan rates based on all of our individual members' claims history. This means that if the costs of one plan are high, it will raise the rates of all other plans, not just the high-cost plan. If we kept the Blue Choice PPO, this would have raised the rates so much for all our other plans that most people wouldn't be able to afford them. By dropping the PPO, we can still offer our other plans at reasonable rates." McCoy said then: "We felt it was important to make sure that we offer a sustainable product. Clearly, the individual marketplace is evolving." To our own inquiry, Edna Pérez-Vega, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, said by email the company’s "retail market PPO plan, offered directly to individual consumers on and off the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Exchange," had become "economically unsustainable, paying out more than $400 million in claims" more "than it earned in premiums." The 2015 Statesman story further said the announced change wouldn’t affect customers with employer group plans or grandfathered PPO individual plans, meaning plans that existed on March 23, 2010, when the Obamacare law came to be. However, the story said, customers who bought PPO plans in or outside of the marketplace--including 367,000 Texans--would have to find new options. The company’s announcement suggested its announcement was timed to give customers time to prepare before open enrollment began anew Nov. 1, 2015: "If you enrolled in the individual Blue Choice PPO plan last year, you won't be able to keep your PPO plan in 2016. We're sharing this information well in advance of the required notification date so that you have plenty of time to research the plan options that best suit your needs," the company said. Company: Health coverage available all over Texas We asked Pérez-Vega if Cruz was right that the company bowed out of the Texas health insurance market. Without mentioning Cruz or his statement, Pérez-Vega replied that the company offers health plans in every Texas county and it’s the only company offering coverage to individuals in 58 of the 254 counties. She also reaffirmed that the company told members in 2015 "we would no longer offer PPO's to individual policyholders," though, she said, the company said it "would work to transition them to other available insurance plans for individuals so they would not experience a gap in coverage. Those who have been transitioned also have the option of choosing different plans for 2016. " Asked generally when plan holders like Cruz would have been notified of changes, Pérez-Vega said: "Members were notified in the days leading up to Oct 1," 2015. Our ruling Cruz said: "Blue Cross Blue Shield cancelled all their individual (health care) policies in the state of Texas, effective Dec. 31." Actually, the company continues to sell coverage all over Texas, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. The company also says individual customers like Cruz were notified months before 2016 changes—including an end to individual PPO plans--kicked in. So, Cruz was both incorrect about Blue Cross’ offerings in Texas and evidently mischaracterized how his own coverage came to lapse. That adds up to Pants on Fire!

UPDATE, 9:43 a.m., Jan. 25, 2016: After we published this fact check, Cruz’s campaign separately said Cruz hadn’t realized when he spoke in New Hampshire that after Dec. 31, 2015, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas shifted Cruz’s family from the policy it was losing to an HMO plan. That is, he wasn’t uninsured after all. We’ve added this detail to our story; it did not change our rating of his general claim.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-01-22T16:19:18	2016-01-21	['Texas']
pomt-04426	" … if the Agreement goes into effect, the millions of Mexican citizens who will become eligible for Social Security benefits may have a far stronger claim to benefits and protection against cuts than U.S. citizens!"	false	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/15/senior-citizens-league/group-claims-mexicans-not-americans-protected-soci/	Despite the time of year or political season, the topic of Social Security is always at the forefront of discussion, specifically among seniors tracking the status of the program and of their benefits. In 2021, interest from investments will stop covering the cost of the program, which provides benefits for 55 million people. The fund is projected to run out of money by 2033 – three years earlier than predicted last year, according to the federal Social Security Administration’s 2012 report. Various options have been bandied about in Washington to keep the program afloat longer, including cutting benefits and removing income tax caps to funnel more money into the system. The Senior Citizens League, an Alexandria, Va.-based, nonprofit advocacy group for seniors on issues including Social Security, Medicare and veteran and military retiree benefits, seized on the Social Security debate in a September mailer to members. A reader sent PolitiFact the mailer and asked us to examine the claims made by the organization. TSCL’s latest mailer warned about international Social Security agreements, called totalization agreements, that coordinate the U.S. Social Security program with comparable programs of other countries. The totalization agreements prevent workers in one country from paying dual national retirement system taxes when working in another country, and the pacts also help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country. The U.S. has these types of agreements with about two dozen countries. A pending agreement with Mexico was signed in 2004 but has not yet been adopted[this is repeated later]. TSCL says it retained a law firm to study the U.S./Mexico agreement and, "They believe if the Agreement goes into effect, the millions of Mexican citizens who will become eligible for Social Security benefits may have a far stronger claim to benefits and protection against cuts than U.S. citizens!" as reported in the mailer. TSCL has 1.3 million members/supporters, according to its website. The organization has been criticized in the past for its "scare tactics" aimed at seniors and about issues involving Social Security and health care, and for seeking donations from its members in misleading solicitations. We asked Shannon Benton, TSCL’s executive director, about the Social Security letter and the research done on the totalization issue. Benton says the group has worked on the issue for years, including sending out various mailers about the Mexican agreement in the past. TSCL hired Virginia law firm William J. Olson, P.C. to do the work over the years. The firm handles constitutional law and has done work on behalf of other organizations including Gun Owners of America and the Conservative Legal Defense and Education Fund. It has filed eight Freedom of Information Act requests between the Social Security Administration and the State Department and filed a lawsuit to obtain a copy of the agreement in December 2006, attorney Bill Olson told us in an email. One of TSCL’s main concerns with the Mexican agreement has been whether millions of immigrants who have worked in this country illegally would become eligible for U.S. Social Security benefits, along with their dependents, and hurt the program’s trust funds, Olson wrote. Previous PolitiFact checks found that there were no plans in Congress to allow illegal immigrants to collect Social Security benefits, even though many pay in the system. They could receive benefits only when and if they became legal. But would Mexican citizens working in the country legally have greater protection from future cuts than U.S. citizens? To break down the issue, we started at the beginning. The totalization agreement with Mexico has not yet been adopted by both countries, and there are no ongoing negotiations, according to a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration. We asked the administration for the number of workers who would be covered by the agreement with Mexico, but received no response. Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who has been researching world pension changes, estimated the possible number of Mexicans covered under this agreement at around 1 million. Those are "people who have paid into this [Social Security] system, those who are here [in the United States] legally," Neuby said. Social Security benefits are not a contractual right and can be changed by Congress, a 1960 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Fleming v. Nestor, established. But the TSCL claim that the totalization agreement would give Mexican citizens stronger claims to benefits and protections against cuts doesn’t hold up, according to experts on the issue. The agreement is based on U.S. law, and that covers every beneficiary, Neuby said. For citizens of Mexico to be treated differently than U.S. citizens, Congress would have to create an exclusion for them, she said, a move that would be "political suicide." "If Congress cut the U.S. benefits and not the Mexican citizens’ benefits, the people in Congress would be chased and would probably be shot," Neuby said, adding that such a move would be "political suicide" for Congress members. Added Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution: It’s hard to see how the description of totalization agreements "can be squared with the idea that foreign citizens who receive Social Security would be exempt from a legislated cut in Social Security benefits that applies to U.S. citizens." While it is true that Congress can cut Social Security benefits, the claim that the pending totalization agreement would better protect Mexican citizens from benefits cuts is not accurate. The pending agreement has not been approved by the United States or Mexico, but to exclude some citizens from any cuts would require an exemption by Congress that is highly unlikely. We rate the claim False.	None	Senior Citizens League	None	None	None	2012-10-15T06:00:00	2012-09-03	['United_States', 'Mexico']
pomt-13923	"Attempts to find things like, ‘crime,’ ‘criminal activity,’ ‘indictment,’ have been filtered out by Google" in favor of Hillary Clinton.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jun/23/andrew-napolitano/did-google-adjust-its-autocomplete-algorithm-hide-/	Is America’s most popular search engine trying to make us forget about Hillary Clinton’s email woes? The hosts of Fox & Friends explored this angle in a June 16, 2016, segment that started with a video clip contrasting autocomplete predictions for searching "Hillary Clinton cri" on Google, Yahoo and Bing. After watching the video, which was from a website called SourceFed, Fox News’ chief judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano accused Google of hiding Clinton’s problems. "The clip that we just ran is the result of a very extensive test, an examination, about whether or not attempts to find things like, ‘crime,’ ‘criminal activity,’ ‘indictment,’ have been filtered out by Google, and we know that it has," Napolitano said. We wanted to find out for ourselves if Google manipulates search suggestions in favor of Clinton. Napolitano did not return emails seeking comment. The SourceFed video, posted on YouTube June 9, shows how certain terms, when searched with Clinton’s name, don’t autocomplete as suggestions underneath the search bar. For example, when users search "Hillary Clinton cri," the suggested searches are "Hillary Clinton crime reform," "Hillary Clinton crisis," "Hillary Clinton criticizes obama 2008" and so on. No suggestions for "Hillary Clinton crime" itself. However, Bing and Yahoo bring up "crimes" and related returns when you search "Hillary Clinton cri." What’s going on? Searching for the truth SourceFed clarified its original video with another one June 10, which included comment from Google denying the accusation. CNN Money also put its two-cents in the mix, saying Google’s algorithm was set up to filter-out offensive information. In a statement, a Google spokesperson says the filter "operates according to the same rules, no matter who the person is." "The autocomplete algorithm is designed to avoid completing a search for a person’s name with terms that are offensive or disparaging," the statement says. "We made this change a while ago following feedback that Autocomplete too often predicted offensive, hurtful or inappropriate queries about people." The statement linked to a Vox article that refutes the idea Google is manipulating autocomplete in favor of Hillary Clinton. The article says that most people who are accused of crimes but were not convicted will not show up in suggestions. We wanted to test Vox’s theory, so we searched "Casey Anthony cri" and "George Zimmerman cri." Both were suspects in criminal murder investigations and were acquitted. The autocomplete yielded no suggestions. We wanted to try other presidential candidates and common allegations against them. When we searched "Donald Trump fraud," no suggestions came up. When we searched "Bernie Sanders communist," two suggestions appeared, but only when we spelled out "communist." "Bernie Sanders arrest" didn’t yield any results either. A search of ‘Donald Trump rac’ does yield arguably offensive suggestions. Experts told PolitiFact that Google’s autocomplete algorithm is not out-of-the ordinary for popular search engines. "Google is the market leader among search engines by far, so its actions have a much larger impact than those of other search engines," said Susan Worst, a lecturer in computer science at Boston University said. "That it would be leading the way in modifying its autocomplete algorithm is not unusual at all." Worst cited an instance last year when Google made corrections to its algorithms after its photo recognition project delivered racist results to users. For many years, autocomplete algorithms were based on what others have typed in the past, but the possibility of Google changing its algorithm to detect offensive term suggestions isn’t that surprising, said Marti Hearst, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. She said major search engines update algorithms frequently to assimilate to the "changing online environment." "Algorithms have to be clever to show the best few choices, according to very complex measures of ‘best,' " Hearst said. "No doubt there are filters for curse words, and as time has gone by and the tenor of our times are getting more divisive, I would not be surprised if an algorithm has been developed to detect terms that feel offensive to a large segment of the population." Our ruling Napolitano accused America's most popular search engine, Google, of scrubbing search suggestions in favor of Clinton. Although it is clear Google’s algorithm is different from Bing or Yahoo, it still isn’t correct to describe the difference as evidence of Google’s support of Clinton. Google’s suggested searches, for the most part, avoid offensive suggestions for everyone, not just Clinton. Napolitano’s claim has a thread of truth, but it leaves out key details that would give the reader a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4b442b95-e20a-4768-babf-61ed5ba7062f	None	Andrew Napolitano	None	None	None	2016-06-23T16:00:00	2016-06-16	['Google', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-10323	Barack Obama "is more to the left of the announced Socialist in the United States Senate."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/29/john-mccain/if-you-look-at-one-narrow-source/	It's an old standby of GOP presidential politics to paint Democratic opponents as liberals who are out of step with the American mainstream. Sen. John McCain took up that line of attack against Sen. Barack Obama this month in an interview with the Kansas City Star. Obama is "more to the left of the announced Socialist in the United States Senate, Bernie Sanders of Vermont," McCain said when asked if he really thought Obama was "an extremist." In truth, this is a recycled charge, one that PolitiFact examined before. But since the charge lives, we'll take it on again. McCain's source is a vote rankings study put out each year by National Journal, a respected, nonpartisan, inside-the-beltway weekly magazine. In January 2008, after analyzing 99 of the 442 votes taken by the Senate in 2007, National Journal reported that Obama was the most liberal of the bunch. Sanders finished fourth. The two differed on just three of the 99 votes the magazine studied. According to National Journal, the three votes occurred in January, March and June of 2007. In January, Sanders joined a conservative majority in voting against establishing a Senate Office of Public Integrity to handle ethics complaints against senators. Obama voted for it. Likewise, Sanders was with a conservative majority in June when he voted against moving forward with a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Again, Obama voted for it. But in March, it was Obama siding with a conservative majority in voting for a resolution stating that funds for U.S. troops in the field should not be cut off. Sanders voted with liberals against the resolution. So, as far as that one study goes, Obama was more liberal than Sanders in 2007 by a net difference of one vote. But the magazine's tally is inherently subjective, since it relies on the judgment of its editors and reporters to determine which votes show an ideological distinction. And the sample size of votes comparing Obama to Sanders is quite small. Sanders only joined the Senate in 2007, Obama in 2005. And Obama wasn't the most liberal senator in either of his first two years, finishing 16th-most liberal in 2005, according to National Journal, and 10th-most liberal in 2006. And as PolitiFact found earlier this year, other tallies disagree with National Journal's findings. Voteview.com, which conducts a similar study based on the judgments of political scientists, found that eight current senators, including Vermont's Sanders, were more liberal than Obama. The Voteview.com study looked at the breadth of the senators' careers, not just the most recent year. Likewise, Americans for Democratic Action, a self-described liberal group, found that Obama needs to get a lot more liberal to match up with Sanders. In tallying votes it believed showed a liberal position, the group reported in February that Obama scored only a 75 percent liberal quotient in 2007, while Sanders clocked in at 95 percent. Obama might have scored as well as Sanders if he hadn't missed five of the 20 votes the ADA scored. Missed votes are counted against senators in the study. Sanders, by contrast, voted with the ADA on 19 of the 20 votes the group tallied. Another method of evaluating senators' politics is used by Congressional Quarterly, which gauges how often they vote with members of their own party on bills that divide most Republicans from most Democrats. In that tally, both Obama and Sanders sided with the Democrats on 97 percent of partisan votes in 2007. Even Charles Green, National Journal's editor, says he'd be wary of putting too much stock in any one rating methodology. "There's pluses and minuses to each rating system. If you look at a number of them, I think you have a pretty good picture," he told PolitiFact in June. So while McCain can make a case that Obama was more liberal than Sanders in 2007, that conclusion is more a matter of opinion than fact. As a result, we find his statement Barely True.

pomt-04756	There has been "$5 trillion in debt added over the last four years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-there-has-been-5-trillion-debt/	During his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie picked up on one of the convention’s biggest themes -- that the United States is on a fiscally unstable path, with the accumulation of too much debt. "With $5 trillion in debt added over the last four years, we have no other option but to make the hard choices, cut federal spending and fundamentally reduce the size of this government," Christie said. We thought we’d check to see whether Christie’s math is correct. We will start by noting that there are two main types of federal debt, and Christie didn’t specify which one he was referencing. One, known as gross federal debt, includes all debt obligations of the federal government. The other -- public debt -- is a subset of gross federal debt that excludes debt owed by one part of the government to another part of the government, such as money lent by the Social Security trust fund for use elsewhere. In the past, experts have told us that both measures have legitimate purposes, so we will look at both of these numbers without favoring one over the other. We used a Treasury Department online calculator that tracks both measures of debt on a daily basis. Even though Christie said "four years," we assumed that -- as a good Republican -- he meant to start the clock on the day Barack Obama was inaugurated, and that he did not intend to count the final four and a half months of George W. Bush’s administration. Given this framework, how do the numbers stack up? On Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama took office, the public debt stood at $6.3 trillion. By Aug. 27, 2012, the public debt had risen to $11.2 trillion. The increase: $4.9 trillion. That’s close enough for us to $5 trillion. As for gross federal debt, it rose between those two dates from $10.6 trillion to $16 trillion, an increase of $5.4 trillion. By this measure, Christie’s lowballing it. We should note that in its ratings, PolitiFact considers not just the factual accuracy of a statement, but also whether credit and blame is fairly assigned. In this case, Christie has a point that the Democrats bear some responsibility for this debt increase, since Obama was president for the entire period and the Democrats had majorities in both chambers of Congress for two years. But the Republicans have controlled the House since January 2011, and much of the debt stems from entitlement spending policies that were set under various past presidents and Congresses of both parties. So the overall blame is fairly bipartisan. Our ruling Christie’s claim -- that there has been "$5 trillion in debt added over the last four years" -- is just about on target. His number is either slightly high or a little low, depending on the type of measurement used, and that’s actually for a period short of a full four years. His implication that Obama and the Democrats are to blame has some merit, but it ignores the role Republicans have had. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1946db8e-eefc-46db-95e4-0c5031d907e1	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2012-08-28T22:47:53	2012-08-28	['None']
pomt-14044	"In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-faults-donald-trump-hoping-real-es/	The commercial seems like an example of the old adage, "Be careful what you wish for." Democrat Hillary Clinton posted the ad, which we caught on Instagram, on May 24 slamming Republican Donald Trump for saying he would welcome a burst in the housing bubble affecting real estate prices a decade ago. "In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash," it says, showing a picture of Trump giving two thumbs up. The ad goes on to list consequences from the Great Recession, which peaked in 2008. It lists 9 million jobs lost and 5 million families who lost their homes. "And the man who could be our next president was rooting for it to happen," the ad contends. That's followed by audio, identified as being from 2006, of Trump saying, "I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy ... If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you could make a lot of money." "If Donald wins," the ad concludes, "you lose." The Instagram description accompanying the video says, "Millions of Americans lost jobs and homes in the '08 crash. A man who hoped for it has no business being president." We wondered if there was more to the story. The Trump campaign didn't respond to our emails. When we emailed the Clinton campaign, they sent us two links. A May 19 CNN story offers details of Trump's comment, along with context. A May 23 story from NBC News shows that Trump's remark wasn't a one-time affair. His statement reported in the Clinton ad comes from the audiobook How to Build a Fortune, created as part of Trump University, which has been the subject of three lawsuits from former "students" who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire. In 2006, real estate values had peaked and there was concern that they were overpriced, creating a "bubble" that could burst, producing a rapid fall in values. The man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, "There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?" "Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position — which I'm in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy," he says in a portion of the audiobook posted by CNN. "If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money." Whether the "bubble burst" that Trump was hoping for deserves to be called a "crash," especially a crash on the scale of what occurred during the Great Recession, is open to debate. But it's important to stress that Trump was doing nothing than articulating an investment principle — look for a bargain. Good investors, he was arguing, should buy low and sell high. More importantly, in the audio book, Trump immediately adds: "At the same time, I don't think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit." Obviously, he would turn out to be wrong. A year later, in 2007, Trump was telling the Toronto Globe and Mail that he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down. "People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is," he told the paper. "I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets." But, once again, it's clear that Trump didn't see what was coming. The story begins: "Donald Trump almost lost his shirt 15 years ago when the North American real estate bubble burst. The 2007 version of that disaster will be much more benign, the real estate magnate predicts. . . 'We're talking very minor (problems) compared with the depression of the early 1990s,' Mr. Trump said." The story said he was advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices. In short, even as the events that sparked the Great Recession were unfolding, Trump was not predicting the size and the scope of the economic disaster. Our ruling Clinton said, "In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash." He said on more than one occasion that he welcomed a downturn in the real estate market because it would give him a chance to buy properties at a bargain and sell them at a higher price later. That's the essence of profitable investing. What's far less clear is whether Trump was rooting for something on the scale of the Great Recession, a suggestion made in the Clinton ad. In fact, his comments in his audiobook and to the Globe and Mail show that he didn't envision the financial meltdown that followed. Because Clinton's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/476b3221-a0ce-40cc-ba96-56605fcd50b1	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-05-26T14:57:48	2016-05-24	['None']
pomt-06855	"The average Republican voter thinks there should be some revenue as part of this deal."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/03/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-said-average-republican-favors-includ/	As the debate over the nation's budget intensified over the weekend, liberal commentator Paul Krugman lamented that increases in tax revenue were being left out of the overall deal. "On the politics of this, if you look at the polling, it turns out that the average Republican voter thinks there should be some revenue as part of this deal, right? So the president has agreed to -- not just to an agreement that's way to the right of the average American voter. It's actually to the right of what the average Republican voter wants." Krugman is saying that even Republican voters support some limited form of tax increases. We looked at a similar statement a few weeks ago from President Barack Obama. Obama said back on July 15, 2011, that "the clear majority of Republican voters think that any deficit reduction package should have a balanced approach and should include some revenues." We rated it Barely True (since re-named Mostly False). At the time Obama made his statement, we found one recent poll that supported his claim but two other polls that showed a much more evenly divided picture. We wondered if polling data showed growing support from Republicans for increasing tax revenues, in the form of tax increases or closing loopholes and removing exemptions. Interestingly, the polls we've looked at have shown markedly different results, sometimes showing Republican support for limited tax increases but sometimes showing opposition or an even divide. As pollsters have long noted, sometimes the way the question is phrased can affect the results. We should note that we didn't consider polls that only asked people if they favored spending cuts or tax increases, since the relevant question is whether people support both spending cuts and tax increases. Here are the three polls we looked at when we fact-checked the issue a few weeks ago. • A Gallup poll poll conducted July 7-10, 2011, asked: "As you may know, Congress can reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting spending, raising taxes, or a combination of the two. Ideally, how would you prefer to see Congress attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit: only with spending cuts, mostly with spending cuts, equally with spending cuts and tax increases, mostly with tax increases, or only with tax increases?" The answer "only spending cuts" got 26 percent from self-identified Republicans. The other answers from Republicans were "mostly spending cuts," 41 percent; "equal spending cuts and tax increases," 24 percent. Another 3 percent favored "mostly" or "only" tax increases. So about 68 percent of Republicans were open to some tax increases. • A Quinnipiac University poll conducted July 5-11, 2011, asked, "Do you think any agreement to raise the national debt ceiling should include only spending cuts, or should it also include an increase in taxes for the wealthy and corporations?" In this case, 48 percent of Republicans favored spending cuts only, while 43 percent favored including tax increases. Another 9 percent were unsure. • A Reuters/Ipsos poll from June asked, "As you probably know, the US budget deficit is currently about $1.4 trillion. There are a number of different solutions being discussed for reducing this deficit. These are cutting existing programs, raising taxes, or some combination of the two. Which approach do you think is best?" In that poll, 43 percent of Republicans said cut existing programs, while 44 percent favored including tax increases. That result was within the margin of error. In addition to those three polls, we found three more recent polls. • A CNN/ORC poll conducted July 18 to 20 asked about the recent discussions on the debt ceiling. It asked, "If you had to choose, would you rather see Congress and President Obama agree to a budget plan that only includes cuts in government spending, or a budget plan that includes a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on higher-income Americans and some businesses?" That poll found that, among Republicans, 61 percent favored spending cuts only, while 37 percent said spending cuts and tax increases. So this would not support Krugman's statement. • A Pew Research Poll conducted July 20 to 24 asked, "In your view, what is the best way to reduce the federal budget deficit? Should we mostly focus on cutting major programs, increasing taxes, or should we do a combination of both?" Among Republicans, 46 percent favored a combination of both, while 39 percent favored cutting programs. These results would support Krugman's statement. • Reuters/Ipsos polled again on the debt ceilling on July 25, 2011. It asked its same question from June, whether people favored cutting programs, raising taxes or some combination of the two. This time, it found that 41 percent of Republicans favored only cutting programs, while 52 percent favored some form of tax increase. This too would support Krugman's statement. To summarize these three newer polls, we still find mixed evidence. One poll showed Republicans favor spending cuts only; the other two showed Republicans favor including tax revenue increases. We e-mailed Krugman about our fact-check, and he referred us to an analysis from the New York Times blog Five Thirty Eight, which specializes in political statistical analysis. Five Thirty Eight analyzed the Gallup poll from early July in some depth, extrapolating what level of tax increases Republicans might support. But it didn't consider the other polls that we've described here. In conclusion, when we rated a similar statement from Obama a few weeks ago, the evidence seemed more mixed on whether Republicans favor some form of tax increases as part of a budget deal, the way that Democrats and independents do. Now, the polling seems to be moving a bit in Krugman's direction. Nevertheless, the polling results are still conflicted. While we can point to several polls that support Krugman's statement, we can also point to some that refute it. Of the six polls we looked at, three polls showed Republicans favored a package that included some tax revenues, two polls showed opposition, and one poll was a statistical tie. We're not convinced polls show that the average Republican favors some form of tax increases to reduce the deficit. Overall, we rate Krugman's statement Half True.

pomt-11488	"You take Pulse nightclub. If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-pulse-nightclub-shooting/	During a televised meeting with lawmakers, President Donald Trump emphasized the importance of firearms as protection against mass shootings in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting that killed 17. He compared an unarmed group to "sitting ducks," and referred to the June 2016 shooting at an Orlando nightclub. "You take Pulse nightclub," he said Feb. 28. "If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did." That didn’t sound right to us, so we did some digging. Turns out, Trump is wrong on how that attack unfolded. An armed police officer working at Pulse exchanged fire with gunman On June 12, 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded dozens more in a shooting rampage at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Trump ignored the crucial fact that an armed, off-duty police officer in uniform was working security at the club that evening. Soon after the first shots rang out, officer Adam Gruler, a 15-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, exchanged gunfire with Mateen. This isn’t the first time Trump has made this erroneous claim. Our friends at Factcheck.org flagged a similar statement after candidate Trump at a June 15, 2016 campaign rally — days after the Orlando shooting — bemoaned that there were "no guns on the other side." Several days later Trump took to Twitter to clarify his statement after backlash from gun safety advocates and even the National Rifle Association, who said alcohol and guns don't mix. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees," Trump tweeted June 20, 2016. Trump’s latest statement on the Pulse shooting gives the impression clubgoers were defenseless, which was not the case. (The White House did not respond to our request for comment.) The Justice Department in 2017 released a nearly 200-page report detailing the Orlando police response to the shooting. Here’s the report’s account of Gruler’s initial confrontation with Mateen: "Outside, in the Pulse parking lot, (Gruler), who was working extra duty at the club — to provide outside security and to provide assistance to security personnel inside the club if needed — heard the shots that were being fired; at 2:02:17 a.m., he broadcast over the radio, 'Shots fired, shots fired, shots fired,' and requested additional officers to respond. "The detective told the assessment team that he immediately recognized that his Sig Sauer P226 9mm handgun was no match for the .223 caliber rifle being fired inside the club and moved to a position that afforded him more cover in the parking lot. Two patrons attempted to flee through an emergency exit on the south side of the club. When the detective saw the suspect shoot them, he fired at the suspect." According to an Orlando Police Department report, additional officers arrived on the scene about a minute after Gruler’s call for backup was broadcast. A second backup officer arrived about a minute after that. At 2:05 a.m., Gruler advised that the suspect had an assault rifle (the gunman also carried a Glock 17 9mm handgun). Gruler again shot at Mateen, this time "firing three shots at the suspect as the sound of rapid fire gunshots were heard inside the club." Mateen was ultimately shot and killed in a shootout after law enforcement, including SWAT team members, breached the building's wall. Some 300 local law enforcement officers responded to the scene during the three-hour standoff, according to the Orlando police report. Gruler would later attend Trump’s State of the Union address on Jan. 30 as a guest of Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla. Our ruling Talking about the Pulse nightclub shooting, Trump said, "If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did." An armed, off-duty police officer in uniform was at the club during the shooting, and exchanged gunfire with the shooter, who managed to kill 49 people. We rate this False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com What do you think? PolitiFact Republican guest columnist former U.S. Rep. David Jolly says how politicians use and interpret true facts to influence their policy decisions is rightly a matter of their own personal judgment, for which they are ultimately held accountable by voters. But whether those politicians are actually offering facts or mere falsehoods in justifying their proposals is increasingly a matter for which fact-checking organizations are necessary to provide accountability in our political debates.

pomt-02359	The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate approved a bill "denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/20/chris-larson/wisconsin-democratic-leader-chris-larson-says-gop-/	On March 12, 2014, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin state Senate approved several pieces of legislation that dismayed Democrats. The same day, Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson of Milwaukee pounced on three of the bills, citing them in a fund-raising email he sent on behalf of a committee that works to elect Democrats to the Senate. One of the bills, Larson wrote, is "denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country." Fund-raising letters often make startling claims, like "denying" rights. Let’s see how this one does on the Truth-O-Meter. The bill The bill Larson cites is due for a vote in the state Assembly on March 20, 2014. Gov. Scott Walker has not said whether he would sign it. The bill would change requirements for anyone who files a lawsuit claiming they contracted an illness, often cancer, as a result of exposure to asbestos. So, despite Larson’s claim, the bill does not target veterans. That being said, veterans, particularly those who served in the Navy, make up a large percentage of people with mesothelioma, one type of cancer caused by asbestos exposure. Some studies show that as many as 30 percent of all Americans with mesothelioma cancer are veterans who were exposed while on active duty, according to Mesothelioma.com. There are two ways that a person with asbestos-related cancer can seek to recover money for their medical costs and other damages: 1. File a lawsuit against a company that manufactured or used asbestos. 2. File a claim with one or more trusts that were set up by now-bankrupt companies to pay victims of asbestos-related illnesses. Under the bill, cancer victims suing an existing company would have to disclose whether they have also filed a claim with any of the asbestos trusts. And if they haven’t already done so, the judge handling the lawsuit could order them to file a claim with one or more of the trusts. Under that scenario, if the lawsuit is resolved in a settlement or at trial and it is determined that the cancer victim be paid damages, the parties or the jury could determine how much should be paid by the existing business being sued and how much, if any, should be paid by trusts. Opponents of the bill worry that a veteran could end up collecting less money, because the funds in some trusts have been depleted, while supporters see the possible apportionment of blame as a matter of fairness. Before we close, a little more from each side: -- Opponents of the bill include the American Legion, Wisconsin Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. They say the the bill could delay a trial for six months or more -- and given that Mesothelioma victims typically die within about a year or less of being diagnosed, a veteran could become incapacitated or die before the trial, hurting the chances of the veteran or the veteran’s family to collect damages. Moreover, if a jury decides an existing business is responsible for damages, the veteran stands a strong chance of collecting a full amount. But if the jury decides that a trust is responsible for some of the damages, it’s possible the veteran wouldn’t collect that entire amount because some trusts are depleted. -- Supporters of the bill include the National Federation of Independent Business, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and the AMVETS veterans group. They say there wouldn’t be any significant delays in asbestos trials because attorneys representing cancer victims would know before filing any lawsuit that they also have to file a claim with an asbestos trust. And even now, it can take up to a year before an asbestos lawsuit goes to trial, so many veterans videotape their testimony in case they die before the trial begins. The supporters also say the bill would stop so-called double dipping: a cancer victim collecting damages from the company they sue and then filing claims for more money with one or more of the trusts. Double dipping arguably depletes funds available for other cancer victims who have legitimate claims. Our rating Larson said the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate approved a bill "denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country." The bill does not target veterans and does not deny their right to seek compensation, both from existing and now-bankrupt asbestos-related companies, for cancer they contracted as a result of serving in the military. But Larson’s claim contains an element of truth, in that the bill could result in some veterans collecting less money from legal actions than they could under the current system for seeking compensation. We rate Larson’s statement Mostly False.	None	Chris Larson	None	None	None	2014-03-20T05:00:00	2014-03-12	['Wisconsin_State_Senate']
pomt-08964	Opponent Holly Benson said that "Just because you're poor doesn't mean you're unhealthy, it just means you have a lot more time to go running."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/20/pam-bondi/holly-benson-once-said-poor-people-have-time-run-o/	Pam Bondi, a former Hillsborough County Assistant State Attorney now running for attorney general, is playing up her courtroom experience and life outside of politics in a new mailer hitting doorsteps of potential Republican voters. The mailer is heavy on self-praise, calling Bondi a "proven conservative," a "hands-on prosecutor" and a "legal expert." Those aren't claims PolitiFact Florida can objectively analyze, but we found something else that caught our eye. In a section of the mailer called "Who's cut out for the job?", Bondi creates a chart that reports to measure the three GOP candidates -- herself, Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp and former Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Holly Benson. One of the categories is: "In their own words." Bondi's answer, since she got to choose it, says that she won't be outworked or outlawyered. Kottkamp's answer comes from a newspaper interview related to the Republican Party of Florida credit card mess that besieged the state GOP in 2009 and early 2010. Then there's Benson's line. According to Bondi, Benson once said that "just because you're poor doesn't mean you're unhealthy, it just means you have a lot more time to go running." The line includes a footnote referencing a Tallahassee radio interview from July 9, 2008, when Benson would have been serving as Gov. Charlie Crist's health care secretary. But would she have said something like that? We found a digital recording of the interview with WFSU's Margie Menzel. Benson and Menzel were having an extended discussion about health and poverty, a serious topic. During the interview, Benson talked about trying to get people to eat more fruits and vegetables, the push for more nutrition in school lunches and the encouragement to take the stairs instead of the elevators. Then, Menzel suggested the economic downtown would continue to create a "downward spiral" in people's health. "It may not create a downward spiral in their health, maybe in their ability to find affordable health insurance," Benson responded. "But just because you're poor doesn't mean you have to be unhealthy. It means you have a lot more time to go running." The answer prompted a devilish laugh from Menzel, and from the sound of it, immediate regret from Benson. (You can listen to the interview yourself here, the exchange starts around the 12 minute mark). Benson almost instantaneously tried to correct her statement. "OK, that's not... that's not really," Benson says over the laughing. Then, she tried to clarify her point. "I don't think just because you don't make a lot of money doesn't mean you can't go exercise." Later in the same program, a caller who identified himself as "Michael from Alabama" criticized Benson's remark, calling it inappropriate and low class. "Thank you sir, I apologize for that. As soon as I said it, I regretted it," Benson says according to the audio recording. "I mistook something that Ms. Menzel said and meant that there's no reason that anybody couldn't be healthy at any time." Bondi quotes Benson accurately in the campaign mailer, but Benson tried to walk back her comment right away and apologized for it later in the same radio interview. We rate Bondi's statement Mostly True.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2010-07-20T18:03:42	2010-07-15	['None']
pomt-06237	Newt Gingrich’s immigration plan offers "a new doorway to amnesty."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/02/mitt-romney/does-newt-gingrich-support-amnesty-mitt-romney-say/	There’s an "A" word in the Republican primary for president -- "amnesty." When Newt Gingrich outlined a more flexible immigration policy at a CNN debate on Nov. 22, 2011, his opponents seized the chance to brand him an amnesty supporter. Mitt Romney said the next day that Gingrich "offered a new doorway to amnesty last night, which as I said last night in my view is the wrong course for a Republican debate." About a week later, Romney repeated his criticism of Gingrich in an interview with Brett Baier of Fox News. "If he's going to do what I believe he said he was going to do for those people who would be allowed to stay permanently and become citizens, that would be providing for them a form of amnesty," Romney said. We decided to investigate the amnesty charge, to see if it was an accurate way to describe Gingrich’s policies. Before we go any further, we need to take a stab at defining amnesty. Merriam Webster defines amnesty as "the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals." In recent American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an "amnesty" program, both then and now. Gingrich’s vision for immigration policy is that it takes place in steps, with the first step of securing the border between the U.S. and Mexico. He also supports a program for guest workers, to allow foreign nationals into the United States to work. Finally, some illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay. "Once you've put every piece in place, which includes the guest worker program, you need something like a World War II Selective Service Board that, frankly, reviews the people who are here," Gingrich said at the debate. "If you've come here recently, you have no ties to this country, you ought to go home, period. If you've been here 25 years and you got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, (and) you belong to a local church, I don't think we're going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out. "The Krieble Foundation has a very good red card program that says you get to be legal, but you don't get a pass to citizenship. And so there's a way to ultimately end up with a country where there's no more illegality, but you haven't automatically given amnesty to anyone." Gringrich’s sets a higher bar for allowing people to stay than the law under Reagan. Based on his comments at the debate and a detailed 10-point plan on his website, Gingrich says his proposal isn’t amnesty for several reasons: It is not citizenship but legal residency; immigrants would have to prove "deep ties to America, including family, church and community ties;" and they would pay a fine of at least $5,000. In the course of our research, we noticed that advocates for more legal immigration often used this distinction. In their view, amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria. Romney, on the other hand, has defined amnesty as giving any kind of special preference to people who are now in the country illegally. "My view is that those people who have waited in line patiently to come to this country legally should be ahead in line, and those who’ve come here illegally should not be given a special deal or a special accelerated right to become a permanent resident or citizen," Romney said the day after the debate. Those who oppose more immigration tend to agree with Romney. "Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, when we asked him about this. After the debate, Krikorian scolded Gingrich in a blog post on the National Review Online for claiming his plan wasn’t amnesty: "If you want to make a case for amnestying long-established illegal aliens, that can be an honorable position, but call it for what it is. Don’t lie to voters, imagining they’re too stupid to see through your deceit." On the other side of the issue is Tamar Jacoby of ImmigrationWorks USA, which represents businesses who favor more immigration. She said Gingrich’s avoidance of the loaded term amnesty was understandable, since his plan is limited and requires illegal immigrants to meet various requirements. She praised Gingrich for his honesty. "He’s getting pilloried for saying we can’t deport 11 million people," she said. "At least Newt is saying, ‘There’s a problem here, let’s come to grips with it.’ " During Romney’s recent interview with Fox News, Baier pressed Romney about what he would do with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants who are already in the country, noting that Romney has stopped short of urging mass deportation in past interviews. "You know, there's great interest on the part of some to talk about what we do with the 11 million. My interest is saying, let's make sure that we secure the border, and we don't do anything that talks about bringing in a new wave of those or attracting a new wave of people into the country illegally," Romney said. Our ruling "Amnesty" has become a radioactive term in American politics, and Republicans in particular do not want their immigration policies described that way. Gingrich supports allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for many years to apply for legal status. He’s said that process should look at each individual and whether they have "family, church and community ties." They would also have to pay a fine. What he describes sounds like a more restrictive process than the 1986 law supported by Reagan that allowed for widespread amnesty. Still, the word amnesty means simply forgiving groups of people who have broken the law. Most legal amnesties include some sort of process. Words matter, and under a more straightforward definition, Gingrich’s plan is clearly amnesty, though it may be limited in scope. Romney said that Gingrich's plan offers "a new doorway to amnesty," which suggests that Gingrich's plan allows for legalization without being the same as the older amnesty law. We rate Romney’s statement Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-12-02T12:20:56	2011-11-23	['None']
pomt-05819	Says he was "exonerated in every single case" in 1990s ethics violations charges.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/20/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-he-was-exonerated-ethics-probe/	Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich faced some of his harshest attacks on ethics violations during the Florida GOP primary last month. On Feb. 10, Gingrich appeared on Neal Boortz’s radio talk show on AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB to make his case. With the Georgia primary just weeks away, Boortz told Gingrich that he should have fought harder in Florida against the attacks. "Well, look," Gingrich replied. "The Wall Street Journal said the ads were false and that in fact I was exonerated in every single case. National Review said the ads were false, I was exonerated in every single case." "Exonerated in every single case?" This was a surprise to us. A U.S. House of Representatives committee looked into whether Gingrich broke ethics rules in the 1990s. All but one of the charges were dropped, and he was reprimanded by the House in 1997. In what amounted to a plea deal, Gingrich agreed to pay $300,000 and admit he had "engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives." So how could Gingrich have been exonerated? He even admitted to poor conduct. We contacted the Gingrich campaign but received no response. We therefore switched gears and took a closer look at the National Review and The Wall Street Journal, the two publications he cited. But first, here’s a review of the ethics controversy, as provided by PolitiFact National: The case primarily involved a course at Kennesaw State College (now Kennesaw State University) that Gingrich taught while in Congress. Its organizers solicited financial support from "individuals, corporations and foundations," promising that the project qualified for tax-exempt status. But the ethics committee concluded that the course aimed to "help in achieving a partisan, political goal" -- something that would run afoul of its tax-exempt status. A further problem for Gingrich was that during the investigation, he submitted letters from his lawyers for which "the subcommittee was unable to find any factual basis." Gingrich "should have known" that the information in the letters "was inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable." The Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation, Gingrich-related groups backed with tax-deductible donations, helped fund the course. Obviously, Gingrich wasn’t exonerated by the House of Representatives. The ethics committee, which has an even number of Republicans and Democrats, voted 7 to 1 to pass a report that recommended a reprimand and $300,000 penalty. The full House passed the ethics report 395 to 28, with 196 Republicans supporting it. Now on to the articles Gingrich cited. Neither publication said he was cleared on all ethics counts. However, an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal said that a formal IRS investigation in 1999 "exonerated Mr. Gingrich." We found a similar claim in the National Review. News accounts tell a different story. The House ethics committee left it to the IRS to determine whether there were violations of tax laws. It cleared the Progress and Freedom Foundation of accusations that it violated its tax-exempt status in 1999. The IRS described its decision as a "close case," according to news accounts. It accused the ethics committee of failing to turn over crucial transcripts. "It is possible that if the ethics committee had rendered full cooperation with our examination, the transcripts might have affected our conclusion," the decision said. News accounts from the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times said that the IRS did not directly exonerate Gingrich. The IRS did find the Lincoln foundation was involved in partisan efforts to train Republican political activists. It lost its tax-exempt status in December 1998, and the decision was upheld in federal court, according to an article in Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. But the IRS restored its tax-exempt status in 2003 through a little-known review process, according to Roll Call. Critics said the move opened the IRS to accusations that it was swayed by political influence, and the process was soon abolished, according to Roll Call. The IRS did not say at the time whether the Lincoln foundation controversy was a factor. An IRS letter restoring the Lincoln foundation’s tax-exempt status does not say whether the group was cleared of engaging in partisan activity. No, Gingrich was not "exonerated in every single case," as he said during the Boortz show. There is no doubt that the full House of Representatives voted to formally reprimand him for his conduct, and he was required to pay a $300,000 penalty. Furthermore, the IRS’ treatment of the Progress and Freedom Foundation and the Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation don’t clear him, either. One was cleared -- with a caveat the IRS was unable to obtain important evidence. Even if both groups were cleared, that would not blot out or negate the House of Representatives’ historic decision to reprimand him. Trying to claim that it does is ridiculous.

pomt-01047	The merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make GSU one of the largest universities in the nation, with more than 54,000 students.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/23/gsu-alumni-association/merger-will-produce-one-nations-largest-universiti/	Since 2011, the University System of Georgia has been consolidating some of its 35 colleges and universities. The biggest of these mergers -- combining four-year Georgia State University in downtown Atlanta and largely two-year Georgia Perimeter College anchored in the suburbs -- is slated to be final in 2016. When this merger was approved earlier this month by the university system’s Board of Regents, officials said the university that emerges would retain the Georgia State name. They said it also would become the largest university in Georgia. But in a mass email to former students, the school’s alumni association suggested the merger will put GSU in an even more exclusive class. With a student enrollment of more than 54,000, the consolidated university also will be one of the largest in the nation, the email said. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts and the numbers. We looked first at the claim that a merged Georgia State and Georgia Perimeter College would be No. 1 among the state’s colleges and universities, based on enrollment. The University of Georgia currently holds that rank, with 35,197 students enrolled last fall, followed closely by GSU with 32,556 students. But a consolidated school would have 53,927 students, if the 21,371 students who attended Georgia Perimeter last fall were put on GSU’s rolls. That would put GSU’s enrollment well above UGA’s and No. 1 in the state by more than 20,000 students, based on current data. Enrollment is forecast to exceed 54,000 by 2016, assuming normal growth.. Now, what about that national claim? We found a couple of organizations that rank colleges and universities by enrollment. But for our purposes we had to discount the most widely known of those, U.S. News & World Report. The magazine, which grades colleges and universities on several standards, bases the ranking we saw on undergraduate enrollment. Georgia State’s claim is based on total enrollment. The website Matchcollege.com identified the largest 300 colleges and universities in the U.S, -- and only 17 of them had 50,000-plus students. Several of the highest-ranking schools were largely on-line, although Ohio State University and the University of Central Florida were high on the list with 56,387 students and 59,601 students, respectively. We discounted the schools that are largely online, including Phoenix University, with its 300,000-plus students. We did not see how to make apples-to-apples comparisons between the largely online and traditional brick and mortar colleges and universities, and a data expert we consulted agreed. Bragging rights are also hard to determine since a lot depends on how the numbers are counted, and who is counted? We found where Central Florida calls itself the second-largest university in the U.S. In Indiana, we found that Ivy Tech College, which is the state's system of community colleges at multiple locations, is considered one college. It calls itself the nation’s largest single accredited statewide community college. We looked at federal government data and went to websites to get more recent enrollment numbers. From that we found: Arizona State University with a first-day 2014 fall enrollment topping 82,000; Lone Star College hitting an all-time high enrollment last fall of 82,818; University of Minnesota reported system-wide enrollment this fall of 67,477; The University of Texas at Austin in fall 2013 had 52,076 students enrolled; and Tarrant County College (another community college in Texas) with a fall 2014 enrollment of 50,628. Richard Vedder, director of the not-for-profit Center for College Affordability and Productivity in Washington D.C., said he was confident that Georgia State will qualify as one of the nation’s largest universities, once the merger is complete. He said it was "a little unusual to have a two-year merge into a four-year" university. "Schools like Georgia State take on thousands of marginally qualified students who don’t go on to graduate and tend to hurt their rankings. Now, they’re going to add Georgia Perimeter students," he said. "It might be good to save an institution. It might be a way to improve access. But I can’t see any reputation gains from it," he said. Vedder also cautioned that "getting big doesn’t necessarily mean getting better." Hank Huckaby, chancellor of the University System, has never said the goal was to boost Georgia State’s size. He has said the merger will play to GSU’s strength as "a recognized national leader in improving student retention and graduation rates." "Combining these attributes with Georgia Perimeter College’s leadership in providing access to students across the metro area presents a major opportunity to improve student success," Huckaby said after the merger was approved. GSU officials also have stressed that the university’s rankings as a top-tier public research university will not be impuned and that Georgia Perimeter’s academic enterprise will be evaluated and measured separately from Georgia State’s bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degree programs by organizations that rank institutions. Students and faculty at GSU and Georgia Perimeter have been voicing concern about how the schools’ two missions will be blended and about staff layoffs forecast for Georgia Perimeter A student earning a 4-year degree from Georgia State can expect to earn $44,200 starting out and $72,900 at mid-career, according to payscale.com. By comparison, a student with two-year degree from Georgia Perimeter can expect to make $37,200 starting out and $48,200 at mid-career. Georgia Perimeter has been without a permanent president since 2012 when President Anthony Tricoli resigned after an audit revealed a budget shortfall at the college of about $25 million. Tricoli has since filed suit, alleging he was made the fall guy and misled about the finances. Revelations about the shortfall initially hurt the college’s credit rating. But it has since bounced back and recently been upgraded. Our conclusion: The merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make the state’s largest university, as plans exist now. It also would make the combined university one of the largest in the nation. We rate the alumni association’s statement True.

pomt-01524	Says Scott Walker's jobs agency gives financial incentives that lead "Wisconsin companies to look at shipping jobs elsewhere. ... A company got $4.6 million in taxpayer money and actually reduced its jobs by 300 people."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/19/mary-burke/scott-walkers-jobs-agency-gives-incentives-lead-lo/	The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., a jobs agency created by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and a GOP-controlled Legislature, has been beset by enough operational problems that it has become something of a political punching bag. But Democrat Mary Burke took the criticism to a new level when she raised questions about whether the agency is actually costing the state jobs. The former state Department of Commerce secretary and Trek Bicycle executive was asked in a Sept. 10, 2014 interview on La Crosse television what she would do to keep Wisconsin from losing jobs to other countries. "It’s absolutely critical," Burke said. "And, unfortunately, we have a situation not only in the state here but across the country where American manufacturers are finding it hard to compete against lower-wage countries. So, as governor, I want to fight for the interests of Wisconsin manufacturers, to level that playing field. She continued: "But also, we shouldn't have incentives that cause Wisconsin companies to look at actually shipping jobs elsewhere. And there was a company that, just yesterday it was just announced that under WEDC -- the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Gov. Walker's chief jobs agency -- that a company got $4.6 million in taxpayer money and actually reduced its jobs by 300 people. So, we have to make sure we’re not having incentives that actually cause employers to ship jobs elsewhere." So, does the WEDC offer incentives that lead companies to move jobs out of Wisconsin? WEDC’s history WEDC was created in February 2011 to replace the Department of Commerce. Walker argued that the partially privatized agency would be able to respond more quickly to the needs of businesses looking to create jobs in the state. Its short history has included controversy. In November 2012, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that WEDC discovered it had failed to track in one centralized database more than $12 million in past-due loans. In May 2013, a state audit found the agency repeatedly failed to follow basic standards in state law for ensuring the clear and proper use of millions of dollars in taxpayer money. And in September 2014, it was revealed that a top WEDC official quit the previous month over the way the agency is run, saying another leader — and former top aide to Walker — was causing the agency "lasting harm." He revoked his resignation three days later. Burke’s claim As for Burke’s claim, her campaign spokesman insisted that Burke did not mean to say WEDC offers incentives that lead Wisconsin businesses to move jobs out of state. But twice in her remarks Burke referred to incentives that could cause businesses to ship jobs elsewhere. So, we're basing our factcheck on what a TV viewer would have heard Burke say. The day before Burke’s interview, WKOW-TV in Madison did a blog post following up on previous news stories it had aired about WEDC assistance to Plexus Corp., a company based in Neenah in Wisconsin’s Fox Valley that also has operations in Europe and Asia. The piece noted that Plexus had received $4.6 million in tax credits from WEDC despite having cut more than 300 jobs. Those were the two figures Burke cited in the La Crosse interview and her campaign confirmed that she was referring to Plexus. Let’s explain. Plexus builds electronics for other companies., such as ultrasound machines for GE Medical Systems and the "Freestyle" soda-dispensing machine for Coca-Cola. In May 2012, it announced plans to build a $50 million, 410,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Neenah to replace two leased plants. At the time, Plexus and WEDC said the agency was eligible for up to $15 million in tax credits for the plant. Walker said as many as 350 jobs could eventually be created. WEDC provides certain portions of the tax credits based primarily on the amount of money Plexus invests in the now-completed plant, which was dedicated in August 2014, and on the number of jobs added over time. Plexus was to retain 1,792 jobs and create 350 more. According to the latest data on WEDC’s database, as of December 2013 only 1,485 jobs were retained -- 307 fewer than planned -- and no new jobs were created. About $4.6 million of the $15 million in credits that were approved had been issued. The tax credit deal runs through 2019. In July 2014, WKOW reported that Plexus said in July 2012, a month after the $15 million in credits were announced, it was laying off 116 workers from its main facility in Neenah. Plexus later issued a statement saying it did the Wisconsin layoffs after unexpectedly losing its largest global customer. The jobs were simply lost as a result of the lost business and were not moved elsewhere, the company said. The affected Plexus employees received federal benefits for workers harmed by overseas trade because the competitor that picked up the contract ended up performing the work in Mexico. A July 2014 memo from WEDC says Plexus will need to rehire for the positions that were cut before receiving any of the tax credits for adding jobs. Most of the new jobs are expected to be added in 2015 and 2016, according to the memo. Our rating Burke said the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Walker's chief jobs agency, gives financial incentives that lead "Wisconsin companies to look at shipping jobs elsewhere. ... A company got $4.6 million in taxpayer money and actually reduced its jobs by 300 people." There is an element of truth in the statement, in that Plexus Corp.'s Wisconsin employment dropped by 300 after it received about $4.6 million in state tax credits. Burke could criticize WEDC for giving money to a company that soon after laid off Wisconsin employees, but there is no evidence the aid led the company to move jobs elsewhere. Indeed, the aid went toward building a new plant in Wisconsin. Our rating is Mostly False.	None	Mary Burke	None	None	None	2014-09-19T10:00:00	2014-09-10	['Wisconsin']
pomt-03525	Says "With nearly 75 percent of Americans supportive of the construction of the pipeline, Schrader needs to explain to Oregon families why he voted against this needed project."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/did-kurt-schrader-vote-against-widely-supported-ke/	The communications office of the National Republican Congressional Committee isn’t letting up on Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. It’s recently peppered him with criticism over the sequester and President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. This time, the issue is construction of a controversial pipeline that would carry crude oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refinement. A May 23, 2013, press release targeted Schrader for voting against H.R. 3, a bill that would allow TransCanada to start building the Keystone XL Pipeline without approval from President Barack Obama. Specifically, the legislation skips further environmental review and removes barriers to construction. "With nearly 75 percent of Americans supportive of the construction of the pipeline, Schrader needs to explain to Oregon families why he voted against this needed project," the release states. Three-quarters of Americans want this project to happen? We know surveys can sometimes use scurrilous, squirrelly language, so we thought we’d take a look-see. Plus, while Schrader is a veterinarian who loves animals, the man is no tree-hugging environmentalist. Does he oppose construction? Let’s tackle the 75 percent statistic first. The NRCC relies on a survey conducted by Nanos Research that was the subject of an April 2013 news report in the Wall Street Journal. Here’s the survey question: Based on what you have heard about the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline between Canada and the U.S., do you support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose or oppose the US/Canadian government approving the project? Of Americans, 52 percent said they support the project and 22 percent said they somewhat support it. Nanos, a respected independent polling firm, isn’t the only one to find that a majority of respondents in the United States support construction. An April 2013 Pew Research poll found 66 percent in favor with 23 percent opposed. The poll found broader support among Republicans and independents; Democrats are more divided. We checked with Daniel Kessler, a media campaigner with 350.org, which opposes Keystone. The Nanos polling question looked sound to him, although he wanted to remind readers that other surveys show high support for clean energy alternatives and efforts to combat global warming. Now, let’s address the second part of the statement. As we stated earlier, H.R. 3 eliminates the need for White House approval to start the project. It’s undisputed that Schrader voted against the bill. Nineteen House Democrats joined majority Republicans to send the bill to the Senate, where it sits. No House Democrat from Oregon voted for the legislation. In fact, the NRCC targeted a number of Democrats with the same press release, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. A spokesman for Schrader said the congressman supports construction in principle, just not the way Republicans are going about it. "To say that he does not support the construction on the pipeline is false," wrote spokesman Cody Tucker in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. Annie Clark with the NRCC disagrees. She cited four other times where Schrader voted against construction. "Schrader voted against constructing or expediting construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline every chance he had," she wrote to PolitiFact Oregon. We checked his other votes. The legislation sought to force Obama to act or bypassed him altogether in approving Keystone. Loads of House Democrats voted against the bills. Schrader did vote against H.R. 3, which eliminates further regulatory hurdles, eliminates presidential input and essentially gives congressional go-ahead for construction. This statement by itself we would rate Half True. It is partially accurate in that Schrader did vote against the legislation, which authorizes the project. But it is missing significant details in that Schrader supports construction in principle, just not this particular way to get there. Had the NRCC said that Schrader voted against the bill -- as opposed to the project -- the statement would be True. The NRCC is accurate in citing that nearly 75 percent of Americans support construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The Nanos survey is solid, as is a Pew Research poll that showed two-thirds support. With the polling part True and the project part Half True, that brings our ruling to Mostly True for this two-part statement.

pomt-06484	Says Democrats raised taxes over 115 times in the past 10 years, "making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/16/tom-kean-jr/tom-kean-jr-says-democratic-tax-hikes-chased-jobs-/	Property taxes are one of the usual go-to sources to gripe about the high cost of living in New Jersey. But there's dozens of other taxes and fees ripe for the picking. Buying new tires? Working on your tan? Looking to blow something up -- legally? All that will cost a little something extra. And a decade of Democratic control in state government is to blame, according to Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. "Over the past 10 years, Democrats have been in control of the Legislature and have done a disservice to New Jersey workers and their families by raising taxes over 115 times, making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states," Kean said in an Oct. 7 news release. PolitiFact New Jersey has heard the claim that Democrats increased taxes 115 times before -- and we’ll probably hear it again. But is it true? A list of the 115 tax increases that John Gorman, a Senate Republican spokesman, sent us included a mix of tax increases, fee hikes and tax policy changes between fiscal years 2003 and 2010. And though the vast majority of the bills were sponsored by only Democrats, a few had Republican support. Also, some of the increases -- whether they were taxes or fees -- were temporary and have expired. But since they went up, if only for a short period, we think it’s still fair to call that an increase. The state increased the sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent in 2006. The legislation that hiked that tax also extended its reach, applying the tax to investigation and security services, tanning and limousine services, among other items and services. The gross income tax was increased in 2004 for taxpayers with income exceeding $500,000 and in 2009 for taxpayers with income exceeding $400,000. And smokers couldn’t have missed the multiple increases on cigarette taxes between 2002 and 2009. But among the 115 "tax increases" were a number of fee hikes -- measures that cost some residents more money but are arguably not a tax increase. Of those were a bill passed in 2008 that increased the maximum fees for permits to manufacture, store, sell or use explosives and a 2004 law that imposed a $1.50 fee on the sale of a new motor vehicle tires. Overall, Gorman provided a list that showed under Democratic majorities, there were dozens of increases in taxes or fees or other tax policy changes that could result in individuals or businesses paying higher taxes. Kean would be more accurate if he said taxes and fees were increased 115 times, but his number isn’t wildly off. Now let’s assess Kean’s larger point that tax increases drove jobs from New Jersey to neighboring states. Gorman sent a handful of surveys and studies that show New Jersey’s poor standing in the nation for its business and tax climate. A 2009 report by the Pew Center on the States said, "While its proximity to New York City and its educated workforce are appealing to many employers, New Jersey has been ranked the least friendly state for business four years running, largely because of its heavy tax burden." That’s a valid point, but there are a number of factors involved in the creation and destruction of jobs. Nancy Mantell, director of the Rutgers Economic Advisory Service, said "so many different things" are involved that you can’t just point to one factor as the reason for New Jersey’s job losses. Also, we previously researched a similar claim by another Republican state senator that blamed Democratic tax hikes for private-sector jobs losses in the last decade. Considering the impact of the recession on employment, we determined that tax hikes aren’t the only factors involved. Our ruling Kean said Democrats raised taxes over 115 times in the past 10 years, "making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states." Under Democratic control of the state Legislature and governor’s office, the state saw nearly 115 increases in taxes and fees or other tax policy changes. But Kean can’t attribute a loss of jobs in New Jersey solely to those changes. We rate his statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-13494	Says Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Affairs scandal is "over-exaggerated." "She said she was satisfied with what was going on."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/donald-trump/Trump-says-Clinton-satisfied-with-VA/	An Iraq War veteran asked Donald Trump at NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum how the Republican nominee would support veterans, beyond words. Trump referred the speaker to his website, saying one of the big problems veterans face is wait times to see doctors. He said his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has been dismissive of the crisis. "And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, there's no real problem, it's over-exaggerated," Trump said. "She did say that." Host Matt Lauer cut in, saying, "No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA." Trump doubled down: "Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me. I'm telling you, this is -- she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration. We wondered if in fact Clinton had used those words to downplay reports about veterans waiting for months to get medical care. Trump’s campaign issued a news release quoting Clinton at a November 2015 event, where she said, "I think Secretary (Robert A.) McDonald is doing a great job, but there is a lot more that needs to be done." The 16-second clip about McDonald, who took over the job in July 2014 after Eric Shinseki’s resignation, doesn’t provide much context of what she said before that quote. The Washington Post reported that Shinseki, former secretary, resigned May 2014 after reports that the VA hospital system "conspired to hide months-long wait times that veterans faced when seeking care." The event followed multiple media reports on extended wait times veterans face to get medical treatment, including reports of veterans dying waiting for care. Trump’s campaign after the forum also pointed to a Wall Street Journal article on criticism Clinton received after saying "It’s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be," on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show, regarding problems at the Veterans Affairs Department. In that interview, Maddow asked Clinton about talks of privatizing the VA and if she had ideas on how to fix the program. "You know, I don’t understand why we have such a problem, because there have been a number of surveys of veterans, and overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment," Clinton said in the Oct. 23, 2015, interview. "Now, nobody would believe that from the coverage that you see, and the constant berating of the VA that comes from the Republicans, in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda that they have." Maddow interjects: "But in part because there has been real scandal." "There has been. But it’s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be," Clinton responded. "Now, I do think that some of the reforms that were adopted last year should be given a chance to work. If there is a waiting period that is just unacceptable, you should be able to, in a sense, get the opportunity to go out, have a private physician take care of you, but at the cost of the VA." Clinton went on to say the problem went "deeper" than access to health care and also included a backlog of disability determinations. "There’s something not working within the bureaucracy," she said. Clinton spoke before Trump at the NBC forum and said she was "outraged" by the stories about the V.A. and that she has been "very clear" about the necessity to move the department into the 21st century. Clinton has called for addressing the VA’s problems at multiple town halls and campaign events. At a June 2015 roundtable in Nevada, she said transforming the VA across the country should be a priority and "what happened in Phoenix and elsewhere is absolutely unacceptable, period," transcripts show. Later in November 2015, Clinton said at a town hall that the VA "does a lot of good work" but also "has systemic problems." "And those have been revealed, and it's been shameful that people have been mistreated. They've been put on waiting lists and never gotten the treatment that they were looking for. They've been given the wrong treatment. There are serious deficiencies within the VA," Clinton said. Our ruling Trump said Clinton said the Veterans Affairs scandal is "over-exaggerated," and, "She said she was satisfied with what was going on." This reading of Clinton’s comments about the problems facing veterans’ health care is misleading and leaves out the full story. While Clinton has said problems at the VA have "not been as widespread as it has been made out to be," she has also acknowledged systemic problems within the system and repeatedly urged reform so veterans can get care quickly. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a08a6514-ee8c-4e0e-9d1e-036b0d0a7c5d	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-07T22:20:52	2016-09-07	['None']
pomt-11647	"Almost half of all vehicles stolen in Texas each year had keys left inside."	false	/texas/statements/2018/jan/12/robert-chody/nearly-half-texas-vehicle-thefts-keys-left-inside-/	A Central Texas sheriff posted a warning that led us to check--and find faulty--key facts. Republican Robert Chody, elected the sheriff of Williamson County in 2016, said in a Dec. 27, 2017, tweet: "65,000 vehicles stolen in Texas each year. Almost half of all vehicles stolen in Texas each year had keys left inside. That’s a lot of preventable thefts #TakeKeysWithYou #LockDoors," his tweet said. Chody made us wonder about the share of vehicles stolen in Texas that have had keys left inside. Our inquiries didn’t prove out the claim and the responsible state agency removed the "almost half" statement from its website. Sheriff cites state agency For starters, Chody told us in a Twitter message that he drew his claim from a web page overseen by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles. That page, "Auto Burglary and Theft Prevention Authority," said toward the top: "It doesn't matter what kind of car you drive, all vehicles are a potential target of theft. Nearly 65,000 cars and trucks are stolen in the state of Texas each year, and thousands more are burglarized. Almost half of all vehicles stolen had the keys left inside." When we asked TxDMV about the basis of its "almost half" finding, spokesman Adam Shaivitz provided statements by email from the anti-theft authority’s director, Bryan Wilson, who noted first that according to information collected and posted by the Texas Department of Public Safety, more than 65,000 motor vehicle thefts were reported each year from 2013 through 2016, when the agency noted 68,461 such thefts. Wilson also shared a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration publication, "Vehicle Theft Prevention: What Consumers Should Know," attributing 40 percent to 50 percent of vehicle thefts nationally "to driver error, which includes leaving vehicle doors unlocked and leaving keys in the ignition or on the seats," the publication says. Also, Wilson pointed out, the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an Illinois-based nonprofit that says it’s dedicated to fighting insurance fraud and crime, published an October 2016 report stating that over several years, Texas ranked second only to California by having 11,003 vehicle thefts with keys inside--a figure drawn from the bureau’s review of theft reports compiled by the federal National Crime Information Center. The bureau’s report says: "Vehicle thefts with keys were identified by using the NCIC text fields available to NICB. Terms indicating the vehicle was stolen with the keys were used as search criteria." Wilson, asked about relevant statewide data, said there hasn’t been a systemwide "science-based empirical study to measure the sometimes surreptitious activity of leaving keys in the car or doors unlocked." A rough calculation We made our own run at gauging the prevalence of Texans leaving keys in stolen vehicles by dividing the 11,003 Texas vehicle thefts with keys inside as noted by the crime bureau into the 200,503 vehicle thefts in Texas tallied by the DPS through the study period. That comparison suggests that 5.5 percent of vehicle thefts in the state from 2013 through 2015 involved keys left inside. Next, we sought to fine-tune our results by asking the bureau to sort its count of Texas vehicles stolen with keys left inside by each of the years. A spokesman, Frank Scafidi, emailed us a chart indicating 3,079 Texas vehicle thefts with keys left inside in 2013; 3,547 in 2014; and 4,377 in 2015. We compared those counts with total vehicle thefts tallied by the DPS for each of the years--an indication the share of stolen vehicles with keys left inside ranged from 4.7 percent in 2013 to 6.5 percent in 2015. Scafidi also offered a caution by telling us to consider the bureau’s counts of thefts with keys left inside to be on the low end of what likely occurred because "we have to rely on reporting officers indicating keys were a factor in the text field of each NCIC record. They don’t always provide that extra bit of information," he wrote. By phone, meantime, Scafidi expressed skepticism at the idea of nearly half of Texas thefts involving keys left in vehicles. Scafidi further noted by email that the bureau does not make that kind of claim in its handout about auto theft that’s made available to police departments. We also asked NHTSA and the FBI about available national data showing how often victims of vehicle theft leave a key in place. In emails, Jose Ucles of NHTSA and Stephen Fischer of the FBI each told us his agency didn’t have such data. Local police agencies Shaivitz separately told us the authority’s tracking of vehicle thefts with keys left inside came from reports submitted by 24 regional task forces or local police agencies awarded grants by the authority to combat vehicle thefts and burglaries. Shaivitz also provided a December 2017 press release from the Amarillo Police Department stating that 762 of the 922 cars and trucks reported stolen locally from December 2016 through Dec. 21, 2017, had the keys left in them--a figure confirmed by the department’s Cpl. Jeb Hilton, who told us by phone that he couldn’t guess why so many motorists had left keys in their vehicles. Shaivitz also forwarded an email from Austin Police Department Sgt. Chris Vetrano stating that 51 percent of locally reported vehicle thefts in December 2017 involved keys left in vehicles. We asked the Austin department to elaborate. By email, Anna Sabana advised that through 2017, approximately 32 percent of vehicle thefts reported to the department "had keys available" when the thefts occurred--compared with about 41 percent the year before. Broadly, Shaivitz said, more than half the authority’s grantees said a major factor in vehicle burglary and theft cases is "people leaving their vehicles unsecured and leaving keys in the interior, although they don’t all report percentages." He specified that authorities in Paris reported that 80 percent to 90 percent of stolen vehicles were due to keys being left inside or available and Potter County officials said 90 percent of stolen vehicles had the keys left in them and the Victoria Police Department reported that in the last quarter of 2017, 69 percent of local vehicle thefts involved keys left inside. Claim removed While we were researching this fact-check, Shaivitz told us the TxDMV had amended the authority’s anti-theft web page by removing the declaration that almost half of vehicles stolen in Texas had keys left inside. Revised text on the web page says: "Many jurisdictions report that keys left inside and doors unlocked are major factors in stolen and burglarized vehicles." Our ruling Chody said that almost half of all vehicles stolen in Texas each year have the keys left inside. Surely some instances of keys left in stolen vehicles go unreported. Yet we identified no statewide data supporting this "almost half" assessment while our calculations rooted in a national group’s research indicate that less than 1 in 10 reported Texas vehicle thefts from 2013 through 2015 involved keys left in vehicles.

pomt-07981	"Between the year 2000 and 2006, (insurance) premiums in this country doubled."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/19/chris-van-hollen/rep-chris-van-hollen-says-insurance-premiums-doubl/	As the debate over a Republican effort to repeal the health care reform law kicked into high gear on Jan. 18, 2011, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., argued against repeal and began by citing a couple of statistics to set the stakes. "I'm interested to hear my colleagues say that they can identify with all the problems in the health care system," Van Hollen said from the floor of the House. "Between the year 2000 and 2006, premiums in this country doubled, health insurance company profits quadrupled, and this Congress did nothing." This statistic is nothing new in the health care debate. In fact, we first visited a very similar claim when Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., wrote a Sept. 21, 2009, opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in which he said, "Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled." As we did then, we'll break this into two fact-checks. We'll deal with the claim about insurance company profits in a separate item. Here we'll address Van Hollen's first claim that between 2000 and 2006 premiums in this country doubled. The time frame cited by Rockefeller is a little different, but the source for fact-checking it isn't. The Employer Health Benefits Survey, published by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, is considered the definitive source for health benefits cost information, and its most recent data stretch from 1999 to 2010. In 2000, average annual premiums for single people were $2,471, a number that rose to $4,242 by 2006 — a 72 percent increase. The amounts for family coverage rose over the same period from $6,438 to $11,480 — a 78 percent increase. We also looked at just the portion of premiums paid by employees, because that's the number most consumers really care about. For individuals, the average premium paid by the employee went from $334 to $627; and for families, the employee contribution went from $1,619 to $2,973. That's an increase of 87 percent and 83 percent, respectively. Those numbers get pretty close to Van Hollen's claim about doubling, but not quite. And so we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-08945	Marco Rubio's "economic proposals will add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/23/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-and-marco-rubio-come-out-swinging-cl/	Liberal MSNBC television host Rachel Maddow and conservative Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio are engaging in a multimedia tit-for-tat over tax cuts and the federal deficit. All set to a background of peppy elevator music, winks and clever one-liners. We're not kidding. The back and forth started on July 14, 2010, when Maddow decided to poke fun at Rubio's "12 Simple Ways To Grow Our Economy." She noted, correctly, that most of the ideas are ripped straight from the Republican playbook. Extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Repeal the estate tax. Repeal the federal health care legislation. Fight cap and trade. Maddow criticized the ideas as failing to consider the GOP's (and Rubio's) other golden rule -- thou shall not increase the deficit. "Republicans want to be the anti-deficit and anti-debt party right now, but they also want to run on George Bush's tax policies," Maddow said. "And that is the giant awkwardness at the heart of Republicanism right now. Because George W. Bush's tax policies did to the deficit what the 'I only eat fried cheese' diet does to your cholesterol." The Maddow rant got a reaction from the Rubio campaign two days later, in a web ad set to that peppy elevator music we talked about. "On Tuesday, Marco Rubio announced 12 simple ways to grow the economy and create jobs," the ad, called "Maddow" begins. "How can you know the plan is right? Rachel Maddow thinks it's wrong." (You really should watch these ads, by the way. Rubio at one point facetiously plugs Maddow's 9 p.m. show; Maddow, in return, facetiously thanks him, and so on). On July 19, Maddow issued her reply to Rubio's ad -- in her own "ad" that mimics Rubio's. "Marco Rubio has proposals for cutting the deficit and growing the economy. He wants to: Make Bush's '01 and '03 tax cuts permanent, end the estate tax, prevent cap-and-trade energy legislation, repeal health reform," Maddow's ad says. "How does Marco Rubio say you can know his plan is right? 'Rachel Maddow thinks it's wrong.' Seriously. That's his argument. That's it. "Even if everything about me is inherently wrong just by virtue of who I am, this is still true about Marco Rubio: His economic proposals will add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit." The Rubio camp issued their latest response on July 21, highlighting the state's unemployment rate and the number of Floridians facing foreclosure while taking a shot a President Barack Obama and Senate rival independent Gov. Charlie Crist. "Think Obama and Crist's policies are working just fine for Florida?" the ad, called "Again, Rachel" asks. For Rubio, the ads are a chance to take on a liberal media-type like Maddow. And we're pretty sure we haven't seen the last of it. That said, we found it an appropriate time to jump in with a fact check. The question we're after: Will Rubio's economic ideas add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit? Maddow's case We know government spending is a big issue for Rubio. On July 16, 2010, we checked and found True a Rubio claim that $0.40 of every $1 being spent by the federal government is now borrowed. We also know Rubio vigorously opposed the federal stimulus bill because it added substantially to the federal deficit. A spokeswoman for Maddow said the talk show host got her deficit figures from the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' nonpartisan number-crunching arm. The CBO produced a series of revenues estimates in February should Congress enact three Republican-held tax cutting ideas -- extend the set to expire 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, repeal the federal estate tax and continue indexing the Alternative Minimum Tax for inflation (The AMT was enacted in 1969 to make sure wealthy people couldn't avoid taxes altogether, but it wasn't indexed for inflation. Congress manually adjusts the AMT for inflation each year). All three proposals are part of Rubio's 12 ideas -- specifically Ideas 1, 3 and 5. Together, the CBO found that they would increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion from 2011-2020, "mostly from lower revenues but also from increased outlays for refundable tax credits." Preventing cap and trade legislation, Rubio's Idea 9, also would have a negative effect on the federal deficit, according to the CBO. The theory behind cap-and-trade is that the government sets a limit on how much carbon different companies, such as electric utilities or manufacturers, can emit (the cap). The government then issues permits to companies and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed so they can conduct business (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively. In a letter dated July 7, 2010, CBO Director Douglas W. Elmendorf said that opposing cap and trade legislation would have the effect of raising the federal deficit by about $19 billion from 2011-2020. Those are the four major ideas Maddow uses in making her claim. But we wanted to at least consider Rubio's other ideas. Many of them, it turns out, come with deficit impacts that are difficult to measure, or at least appear to have no impact on the deficit. Rubio proposes reducing the corporate tax rate, for instance, but he doesn't say how much -- making it impossible to judge the revenue impact. Another Rubio idea is to repeal the federal health care bill (you can see all 12 here). The federal health care bill enacted is estimated to reduce the deficit slightly -- about $143 billion from 2010-2019 -- according to the CBO. But a substitute health care bill -- something Rubio favors -- could reduce the deficit as much. So we've decided to discount the deficit reduction for the sake of this fact check. Excluding the health care repeal, that's about $3.4 trillion that we can verify that will be added to the federal deficit between now and 2020 if Rubio's economic ideas are put in place. Economic debate We turned to economists and Rubio's campaign to see what we're missing. Karen Campbell, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the CBO deficit projections do not account for a fundamental Republican philosophy -- that lower taxes can bolster economic activity across a broader spectrum. Put simply, the lower tax rates are, or the less taxes people are required to pay, the more opportunities that exist for people to make money. It's a sentiment echoed by the Rubio campaign. "A growing economy means more people are employed and generating revenue, more businesses are being started and expanded, and fewer people are claiming unemployment benefits," Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said. That's not an argument for everyone, however. "If you cut taxes, you borrow money, that's it," said Chuck Marr, the Director of Federal Tax Policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "For a lot of Republicans it's gotten to the point, that deficits only concern spending. A deficit is when you spend more than you tax. But for them, it's become just what the spending is. They seem to think that taxes don't matter. Mathematically it's ridiculous." Added Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution: "I cannot see any way that extending the Bush tax cuts or repealing the estate tax could have any effect other than to produce an increase in the expected size of the future deficit. Period. There is no plausible set of private economic responses that would generate an increase in future total tax revenue if those two policies were adopted. The federal government would simply collect less income tax revenue and less estate tax revenue than it is now expected to do." Greg Mankiw, who was the chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisors from 2003 to 2005, estimated in 2005 that a broad-based income tax cut would recoup "only about a quarter of the lost revenue through supply-side growth effects." Mankiw, who teaches macroeconomics at Harvard, referred to people who believe that broad-based income tax cuts could actually raise tax revenue "charlatans and cranks" in the first edition of his textbook, Principles of Economics. Our ruling We realize we're not going to be able to change people's basic economic philosophies. We're not here today trying to disprove supply-side economics, or boost another economic thought. Based on our analysis, we do think it's a stretch for someone like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to suggest the Bush 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were revenue neutral. And yet we also see the logic in the argument that lower taxes could stimulate investment in the economy, creating an army of new taxpayers. Rubio, himself, realizes spending cuts also will be necessary to offset at least some of the tax cuts he's proposed -- and to shrink the federal deficit. Rubio's campaign announced he would roll out ideas to cut government spending on July 26 in Jacksonville. And we'll be ready to examine them. But in this case, we're sticking to Maddow's claim that Rubio's "economic proposals will add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit." The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that extending the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts, repealing the estate tax and continuing to adjust the Alternative Minimum Tax for inflation will increase the federal deficit $3.4 trillion between now and 2020. That's right about on the mark, and only measures the impact of three of Rubio's tax cutting ideas. But unlike Maddow, we do want to leave some leeway for the economic growth those broad-based tax reforms could generate, as well as Rubio's spending cuts, still to be revealed. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2010-07-23T11:35:03	2010-07-19	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-06816	High-speed rail would have cost Florida taxpayers $1 billion to build.	false	/florida/statements/2011/aug/11/rick-scott/gov-scott-says-rail-would-have-cost-state-taxpayer/	On his second month on the job in February 2011, Florida Gov. Rick Scott wrote a letter to the U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announcing he had decided to reject about $2.4 billion in federal money for a high-speed train line between Tampa and Orlando. Scott said at the time that he was worried Florida would ultimately be on the hook for costs. Democrats and some Republicans criticized Scott's move, which killed a project that had been in the works for decades. Florida's high-speed rail debate kept the Truth-O-Meter running at full speed ahead for some time as members of Florida's congressional delegation, several state lawmakers and local officials scurried to try to circumvent Scott. Supporters pitched a new plan to the governor in which cities would take over the project and a private company would assume the risk of cost overruns -- but Scott remained steadfast in his argument that the state could get stuck with huge costs. Several months after Scott squashed the project, he still faces questions about why he put the brakes on it -- as he did during an interview on Tampa Bay's local CBS affiliate Aug. 5. "Here is the deal. I offered it to everybody and nobody wants to do this and that's why I'm not doing it. They offered, the federal government, here's the deal. ... I'm going to give you $2.4 billion -- that sounds nice right? You've got to put up a billion dollars to finish the project. And you are going to lose money every year. And if you decide, gosh I'm tired of losing that money, you've got to give the $2.4 billion back. It's a bad deal." Scott made a similar claim about the $1 billion cost for Florida in an Aug. 5 meeting with Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Raheem Morris after the coach made a comment about liking rail. Readers picked up on the line and asked us if Scott got Florida's share of the high-speed construction correct. To start, it's worth looking at the chronology of what led up to Scott's rejection of high-speed rail. In 2009, the Florida Legislature under Gov. Charlie Crist laid the groundwork for Florida to provide $280 million for a line between Orlando and Tampa. But after Scott took office it was clear that the project was in jeopardy. A December 2010 fact sheet from the Florida Department of Transportation about high-speed rail stated that the federal government would pay for the bulk of the project -- about $2.392 billion. The state's portion, according to the state DOT, would be $280 million. The fact sheet stated that an industry forum in Orlando in November 2010 drew considerable interest from the private sector. "There will be intense competition to win the first true HSR (high-speed rail) in the U.S. Individual meetings with various teams in November 2010 revealed strong private sector interest and willingness to assume ridership risk and invest in the system. Teams are very interested in right-of-first-refusal for Orlando-Miami leg." (The Orlando-to-Miami leg was to be built after Tampa-to-Orlando. That project was more costly but also considered more lucrative in the long run.) Where Scott got his number So why did the state say the rail line would cost the state $280 million to construct but Scott said $1 billion? The answer is because Scott's source of information isn't state transportation officials. It's the libertarian Reason Foundation. On Jan. 6, 2011, the Reason Foundation released an analysis about Florida's rail project, which concluded that capital costs to build the project would be higher than anticipated and ridership would fall short, leaving the state with operational shortfalls. Scott relied on the Reason analysis in killing the high-speed rail project. While the federal government had committed $2.4 billion and the state $280 million, "This report assumes that any cost above $2.7 billion will be borne by Florida taxpayers." The Reason analysis goes on to cite research by European academics who looked at 258 projects in various countries over 70 years and found that cost overruns occurred in 90 percent of the projects and that the average capital cost overrun for passenger rail was 45 percent. "If the Tampa to Orlando high-speed rail line experiences cost escalation typical of international high-speed rail projects, it will cost between $.54 billion and $2.7 billion more than projected," the Reason analysis states. "Based on averages, most likely the overrun would be about $1.2 billion, all of which would be the responsibility of Florida taxpayers." The analysis is right to point out that many other rail projects experienced cost overruns. But there are reasons to question its methodology and objectiveness are suspect. Consider: • The author of the study, Wendell Cox, is a known rail skeptic, and Robert Poole, a Reason Foundation director whose name was on the report, served on Scott's transition team for transportation issues. • Much of the expectation of cost overruns is based on a list of 258 projects studied by European academics. But those projects are not just rail projects. The study includes bridges, tunnels and highways. In fact, of the 258 projects, only 58 (or 22 percent) are actually rail projects. The projects also are predominantly based in Europe. It's also unclear what projects are included and what projects are not. • The $1.2 billion overrun estimate is created simply by assuming the Florida rail project will cost 45 percent more than anticipated. How is that assumption made? By calculating the average overrun in 258 transportation projects considered. There is no analysis to suggest Florida will experience an "average" cost overrun compared with the other projects. • The study also fails to account for the current low price of construction and materials given the problems in Florida's economy. As Scott's own DOT secretary Ananth Prasad said on Aug. 8, 2011, in advocating for more road-building projects: "This is kind of like a buyer's market." • And, most importantly, the study assumed Florida taxpayers would assume the cost of all construction overruns, when that likely wasn't true. In an interview, Cox said that he has supported rail programs when they make sense. We asked for an example and Cox said he supported an expansion of a rail project in Hong Kong in 2000. But generally, Cox said that rail projects have not been profitable. "Every single dollar put into high-speed rail has been lost. The record couldn't be more clear." He said his report takes into account some more recent projects within the past decade including one in London. The rail project in London was taken over by the government in 2009 after the consortium faced financial difficulties. The report also considered a current project in California. A report by California's legislative analyst in May cited problems with the rail plans in that state. The Associated Press reported in May 2011 that while the cost for the first phase was estimated at $43 billion in 2009, estimates have grown by as much as 57 percent. Cox sent us this Aug. 9, 2011, news report about California's skyrocketing rail costs. Cox said his study didn't guarantee cost overruns for Florida. But, he said, history shows that overruns were likely. "We didn't say this will be the case -- what we did say was taxpayers in Florida need to be aware of the risks," Cox said. State officials said private companies would pay for construction overruns To satisfy state legislators, who were unwilling to spend any additional state taxpayer dollars on the high-speed project, Florida transportation officials promised in early 2011 that any contract to build the rail line would include a guarantee that Florida wouldn't pay for any construction overruns. Kevin Thibault, the Florida Rail Enterprise's executive director, said in a Jan. 11, 2011, Senate committee meeting that a private consortium -- not state taxpayers -- would be responsible for cost overruns or revenue shortfalls. We listened to a recording of Thibault from the meeting where he stated that a private company would design and build the project and maintain and operate it for 30 years. "The public sector would help fund the major investments of it -- the infrastructure -- and then the private sector role is to assume the ridership risk. Where we've been very clear upfront is the operation and maintenence cost is going to be borne by the private sector. There is no state funds associated with that phase of it. The only funds that's going to be available would be toward the capital end." And the private sector would take on the costs of any construction cost overruns, longterm operations and maintenance, Thibault said. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood also said that private companies, not the state, would be required to pay for cost overruns in a Feb. 16 statement: "We worked with the governor to make sure we eliminated all financial risk for the state, instead requiring private businesses competing for the project to assume cost overruns and operating expenses." Brie Sachse, a spokeswoman for the Federal Railroad Administration, provided the same information in an Aug. 9 e-mail interview. "Federal officials repeatedly assured Gov. Scott that Florida would not be on the hook for either cost overruns during construction or any operating cost deficits. These risks were to be 100 percent assumed by bidders of the project for design, construction, operations and maintenance responsibility, in order to insulate Florida taxpayers. Eight private teams comprised of domestic and international companies were ready to bid on this project and several of these groups said they would be willing to assume any risk associated." Ultimately bids were never sent out to private companies, so we can't for certain say DOT officials would have included the overrun guarantee. And we don't know if private companies would have agreed to the deal. But we do know legislators made it clear they would need a guarantee to move forward with the project. Legislators, we should note, also wanted private companies to pony up the $280 million or so the state had committed to the project, to lighten the state's burden even more. The prospects of that, however, were never completely vetted because Scott pre-emptively killed the project. Our ruling If high-speed rail had moved ahead in Florida, Scott said the state would have had to pay $1 billion to build it. Scott bases his claims on hypothetical cost overruns from a suspect study written by a libertarian think tank. While the study correctly points out that other transportation projects have experienced cost overruns, there are several flaws with the study. Most importantly, the study assumes that the state would pay for cost overruns. But that ignores that both the state official in charge of the rail project and the U.S. Department of Transportation secretary said that the state wouldn't be liable for overruns. And legislators were keen on having it happen that way before fully embracing the high-speed rail line. In the end, the state's share to build the line would have been capped at around $280 million (and legislators hoped the final number would be even less). You can't rewrite history to fit your narrative. We rate Scott's claim False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-08-11T11:40:47	2011-08-05	['None']

GOP Gov. Rick Perry, running for re-election, depicts White as a man running from his record. "The city of Houston now has more debt per capita than California," the narrator says in a May 3 Web advertisement posted by Perry's campaign. White has touted his financial prowess; we recently noted his claim to cutting city property tax rates five times. In contrast, California in 2009 issued 450,000 IOUs for personal income tax refunds. Does Houston have more debt per resident than the Golden State? Believe it. Perry's campaign pointed to fiscal 2009 financial reports for Houston and California. Houston's outstanding debt that year was $5,720 per person. California's debt per person was $2,808 — less than half of Houston's. Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White's campaign, balked. Comparing state and city debt is "ridiculous," she said, arguing that Texas lets local governments, like counties and cities, borrow money to build most of their infrastructure. Next, we asked Perry's campaign why he compared Houston's debt to California's debt as opposed to, say, Los Angeles. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said California was singled out because its economy isn't flourishing "and that sets a pretty powerful comparison looking at the debt between Houston and the debt of the state." Powerful, yes. But reasonable? We asked financial experts all along the political spectrum about that. Like White's campaign, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, said comparing cities' and states' long-term debt can be misleading. "The state will typically have responsibility for public infrastructure, such as highways," Craymer said. "Cities — they're in charge of infrastructure for not just roads, but water, wastewater, solid waste, landfills. They're really very different operations." Talmadge Helfin, director of the Center for Fiscal Policy at the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation, said California's debt load is beyond his expertise. Yet Heflin, former Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that generally, "when you look at cities and states, the cities within a state tend to have a higher debt load than the state does." Heflin echoed the infrastructure Craymer pointed to, that he said cities tend to use bonds to fund. Robert Kline, executive director of the Texas Bond Review Board, said he's never heard of comparing city debt to state debt. In the end, none of the experts we spoke with had either. They included Steve Murray, regional director of Austin-based Fitch Ratings, one of three major national credit rating agencies. "Typically we do not compare city debt and state debt levels primarily because (city and state governments) issue (debt) for very different purposes," Murray said. "The repayment streams can vary greatly, so really, a more appropriate comparison, and what we do, is city to city and state to state." We took his suggestion and compared Texas' debt to California's debt and Houston's debt to that of other big cities. In fiscal 2009, Texas had $1,368 in debt per capita, according to the state's financial reports. That was less than half of California's per-capita debt that year, whose population of 36.9 million people (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) is about 1.5 times the population of Texas. According to Los Angeles' financial reports, the city (the nation's second largest, with 3.8 million residents in 2008, the Census Bureau's most recent data) in 2009 had $3,995 in per-capita debt, or about two-thirds of the per-capita debt of Houston, which with 2.2 million residents in 2008 ranked as the nation's fourth-largest city. Other cities' debt per capita in 2009: the nation's largest city New York ($7,760), third-largest Chicago ($5,274), fifth-largest Phoenix ($3,757), sixth-largest Philadelphia ($4,684) and seventh-largest San Antonio ($1,808). Punch line: Houston's per-capita debt of $5,720 doesn't stand out in this sampling, except that only New York among the three bigger cities had more debt per resident. Meanwhile, Craymer cautioned against comparing per-capita debt loads of cities without taking into account what those debts are paying for. In Texas, for instance, Austin operates its electric utility, while the electric utilities in Houston are privately held. "So you couldn't reasonably compare Houston debt to Austin because they include different things," Craymer said. More on point to how Murray compares cities, we looked at Fitch's most recent credit ratings, which are often used to assess the economic health of everything from corporations to governments. AAA is Fitch's best rating, while D, the worst, means the entity has defaulted. Of late, Houston, New York and San Francisco have received AA ratings from Fitch. Los Angeles was most recently rated AA-. How have state governments fared by the Fitch ratings? Texas most recently got the AAA rating, California landed with an A-. And where does all this debt noodling leave us? Perry accurately says Houston's debt per capita is more than California's debt per capita, a charge that seemingly packs a punch. However, Perry's claim leaves a misleading impression because Houston's and California's budgets are different beasts. Experts concur, moreover, that it's unheard of to compare a city's debts to the debts of a state. We rate Perry's statement as Half True.

pomt-04122	Says in fiscal year 2011, the state had "a projected $11 billion deficit."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/09/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-new-jersey-faced-11-billion-de/	Hurricane Sandy held much of the focus of Gov. Chris Christie’s State of the State address Tuesday, but New Jersey’s economic woes weren’t totally forgotten. Christie talked repeatedly of Garden State resilience and making the tough choices, from tenure reform to hardline collective bargaining to dealing with huge amounts of debt. "In fiscal year 2011, the picture was even worse: a projected $11 billion deficit – on a budget of $29 billion – in percentage terms, the worst in America," Christie told a packed statehouse in Trenton as he reviewed the state’s economic landscape. He also noted that as in previous years, the state budget was balanced without raising taxes. Tuesday’s address marks the fourth time since 2011 that PolitiFact New Jersey has heard that $11 billion figure from Christie. The third time was during Christie’s keynote address in August at the Republican National Convention in Florida. As we did in August, we’re looking only at the claim of an $11 billion budget deficit for fiscal year 2011 and the budget being balanced. First, Christie has balanced the budget every budget year, as required by the state Constitution. So, that claim is accurate. But there’s a problem with his claim about a projected $11 billion deficit for fiscal year 2011. Let’s explain. The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal year 2011 budget, when Christie proposed his first spending plan. A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all spending obligations required by statute were fully funded. But the state does not have to meet all of its obligations because the budget supersedes statute. So although a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise. That’s basically what Christie did in his first budget. He skipped a $3 billion pension payment, didn’t fully fund the school aid formula, and didn’t fully fund the state’s property tax rebate program. When the fiscal 2012 budget year came around, New Jersey still had a projected structural deficit, of about $10.5 billion. But Christie dismissed that calculation, calling it the "old way of budgeting." In a 2011 budget speech, Christie said the projected deficit "assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday’s New Jersey." The next year Christie said, "the baseline is zero" for budgeting. That’s one way of making an $11 billion deficit ‘disappear.’ Our ruling Christie said in his State of the State address that New Jersey in fiscal budget year 2011 faced a projected $11 billion budget. The governor also said that he, with the Legislature’s help, was able to balance the budget. The state Constitution requires a balanced budget every year and Christie met that obligation. But the deficit figure Christie cites refers to a $10.7 billion projected structural deficit, a calculation Christie used to his advantage in his first budget year but has since dismissed as the old way of budgeting. Now, "the baseline is zero" for budgeting, the governor has said. That’s important context Christie’s statement lacks. As it did in previous fact-checks, this statement rates Half True.

pomt-05153	"The Koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/20/debbie-wasserman-schultz/billionaire-koch-brothers-gave-8-million-wisconsin/	As Wisconsin’s historic recall election approached, Democrats lamented the record-setting amount of money raised by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. The complaints continued at the state party’s annual convention on June 8, 2012, three days after Walker defeated Democrat Tom Barrett in the recall. The keynote speaker, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, attacked billionaire brothers and conservative activists David and Charles Koch. "Democrats were up against nothing short of an avalanche of secret, out-of-state and corporate special interest money amounting to a massive $31 million war chest for Governor Walker compared to just $4 million on our side," the south Florida congresswoman charged. "In fact, the Koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett." Roughly speaking, the total figures Wasserman Schultz cited have been widely reported: Walker raised $30.5 million and Barrett, the Milwaukee mayor, $3.94 million. That’s as of reports filed by May 21, 2012, more than two weeks before the election; final reports won't be filed until July 5, 2012. If the congresswoman is correct, David and Charles Koch gave Walker’s campaign $8 million -- more than one-quarter of the governor's total haul. It’s possible, given that Wisconsin law allowed unlimited contributions to Walker during part of the recall campaign. But is Wasserman Schultz on the money? The Koch brothers Before they became front-page news in Wisconsin in early 2011, many residents had never heard of the Koch brothers. Charles Koch, of Wichita, Kan., is chief executive officer of Wichita-based Koch Industries, which owns companies involved in oil and other industries. David Koch, of New York City, is the company’s executive vice president. The brothers, both in their 70s, are each worth $25 billion, making them tied for 12th on Forbes’ March 2012 list of billionaires. In February 2011, a Buffalo, N.Y., blogger posing as David Koch made a prank call to Walker. Walker discussed ways Koch could help Republican legislators, presumably with TV and radio ads. He also said he considered -- but rejected -- planting troublemakers amid demonstrators who had been protesting his policies at the Wisconsin Capitol for a week. We asked Koch companies spokeswoman Melissa Cohlmia to respond to Wasserman Schultz's claim. She said neither brother personally contributed any money to Walker. Indeed, neither brother shows up as a donor to Walker’s campaign in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel searchable database of recall contributors. Case closed? Let’s dig a little deeper. Wasserman Schultz's evidence To back up Wasserman Schultz’s statement, Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Ellen Canale cited parts of a June 2012 CBS News article on contributions benefiting Walker that were linked to the brothers. She cited two figures in the article that add up to a total of $10 million, well above Wasserman Schultz’s claim of $8 million. CBS indicated it got at least some of its data from the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks money in politics, but it didn’t attribute specific figures to the Madison-based nonprofit or to any other source. The article said $3 million was spent on Walker’s behalf by the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, which was founded by the Koch brothers. How or when the money was spent isn’t stated. The article also said Americans for Prosperity spent $7 million in 2011 to promote Walker's agenda, "launching an ad campaign just two days after the governor introduced legislation ending collective bargaining for public unions." So, Wasserman Schultz is backing down from her original claim -- that the Koch brothers gave Walker $8 million -- and is now saying the money came from the group the brothers founded. Canale also provided a second article, from Florida’s Palm Beach Post in February 2012, in which David Koch said of Walker: "We're helping him, as we should. We've gotten pretty good at this over the years. We've spent a lot of money in Wisconsin. We're going to spend more." In saying "we," Koch was referring to Americans for Prosperity, the article said. So, clearly there’s a close connection between the Koch brothers and the group they created. Examining the evidence Two questions arise: 1. Are the $3 million and $7 million figures Wasserman Schultz cites in the CBS article accurate? In examining campaign money in the gubernatorial recall campaign, we reported in late May 2012 that the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign estimated that Americans for Prosperity had spent $2.7 million on Walker’s behalf. The group said it based its estimate primarily on AFP television advertising. We followed up with executive director Mike McCabe about a week after the recall election. He said it's safe to say that Americans for Prosperity in late 2011 and early 2012 spent at least $3 million on Walker's behalf, but that it would be difficult to say how much more. McCabe said he sees no evidence the total would be $10 million, as the CBS article indicated. 2. Is it fair to say those amounts were spent by the brothers when the money, as Wasserman Schultz now admits, came from Americans for Prosperity? David Koch himself refers to Americans for Prosperity as "we." But as a tax-exempt "social welfare" organization, AFP does not have to disclose its donors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C. that tracks money in politics on the national level. So, the sources of Americans for Prosperity’s money, including how much has been contributed by the Koch brothers, aren't readily available -- although the center noted in a March 2012 report that AFP's donations included $1.6 million from the John William Pope Foundation in North Carolina and $520,000 from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee. That makes it clear the group gets money from more than just the Kochs. For its part, Americans for Prosperity says on its website that more than 90,000 Americans in all 50 states have given money to AFP or its sister organization, AFP Foundation. AFP Wisconsin director Luke Hilgemann reiterated to us that AFP doesn't disclose its donors and he noted that the group's ads supported the 2011 state budget reforms, as opposed to a particular candidate or party. The reforms are among Walker's signature accomplishments, although they needed approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature. Our rating Wasserman Schultz said "the Koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett," which would amount to about $8 million. She later said she meant it was through the conservative organization they founded, Americans for Prosperity, although that qualifier certainly was not part of her original statement. The Koch brothers didn’t personally give any money to Walker’s campaign. There is no proof of how much Americans for Prosperity, which gets money from the Kochs but also other sources, spent on Walker's behalf. And the leading campaign money tracker in Wisconsin estimates the AFP total as being in the $3 million range. We rate Wasserman Schultz's claim False. Update: After this item was published, Brendan Fischer of the Center for Media and Democracy pointed out that a June 2012 CNN article said Americans for Prosperity had spent $10 million. We contacted AFP president Tim Phillips, who told us AFP had spent $10 million in 2011 and 2012 on TV ads, direct mail, staff and other expenses to support reforms made by Walker and the Legislature. We also contacted the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which reiterated that it saw evidence of only about $3 million in AFP spending, but that it could not be sure because AFP is not required to report its spending. The original claim cited money directly from the Koch Brothers, not AFP which has numerous other donors. As such, we don't feel a change in rating is warranted.

pomt-00518	After a federal inquiry corroborated Hillary Clinton on Whitewater, "the next day, there was nothing in the media about it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/23/bill-clinton/no-media-coverage-hillary-clintons-exoneration-whi/	Former President Bill Clinton said in a recent interview that questions over his wife’s trustworthiness have been put to rest in the past and will be again. Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, Clinton compared the media frenzy over leaked emails, speaking fees, and Clinton Foundation donations with a 1995 Whitewater report that he said "completely exonerated" Hillary Clinton. Back then, the alleged exoneration didn’t get much traction in the news, he said. "The next day, there was nothing in the media about it. There was stunning nondisclosure," he said on June 14. "So, now we have got social media, and we can have disclosure. And we can all live under the same rules. And it's going to be fine." His claim about missing coverage of Whitewater was as surprising to us as it was to the incredulous Clinton, so we decided to delve into the archives and see if we could confirm his claim. In a separate fact-check, we looked at the claim that the report "completely exonerated" her. That earned a rating of MostlyTrue. Investigating Whitewater The long, long Whitewater saga first came to public attention during Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, when the New York Times published an article detailing the Clintons’ involvement in the late 1970s with Whitewater Development, a real estate corporation. Together with a longtime friend, James B. McDougal, the Clintons formed the company in order to buy and sell vacation property in the Ozark Mountains. McDougal, however, was also the president of Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan association. Over the following decade, the company became engaged in a number of risky real estate ventures and lending deals, including a number of political donations to Bill Clinton’s Arkansas gubernatorial campaign. When Madison Guaranty finally collapsed in 1989, McDougal was indicted on federal fraud charges; though he was later acquitted, a separate investigation ensued, one that eventually implicated the Clintons as potential beneficiaries of illegal activity. To further complicate matters, Hillary Clinton’s law firm had also represented Madison Guaranty as it fought unsuccessfully to prevent insolvency. After Clinton won the presidency, a confused mass of probes, committees, hearings, and special investigations ensued, proceedings that dogged Clinton through most of his tenure in the Oval Office. Questions were raised, as Republicans in Congress searched for a smoking gun: The only problem, to stretch a metaphor, was that nobody knew the make, the model, or even the existential status of the alleged firearm. The investigation was rife with leaks of undisclosed documents that dripped out slowly, and as we’ll see, that contributed a good bit to why the media covered the scandal the way they did. The 1995 Pillsbury Report The Pillsbury Report sat squarely in the midst of this bureaucratic tangle. Commissioned in order to investigate the Clintons’ involvement in the Whitewater venture, it concluded that no civil action should be taken against anyone involved in the real estate deals. This is not the first time Clinton has expressed his disapproval over the media’s coverage of the 1995 report in question, which was authored by independent law firm Pillsbury, Madison, & Sutro and commissioned by the Resolution Trust Corporation, a now-defunct federal agency involved in the Whitewater investigation. In his autobiography, My Life, Clinton writes that he "eagerly awaited" the coverage of the New York Times and Washington Post on the report’s findings, but was disappointed by the results: "Immediately after the RTC report was released, the Post mentioned it in passing, in the 11th paragraph of a front-page story...and the New York Times didn’t run a word. The Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and Washington Times ran an Associated Press story of about four hundred words on the inside pages of their papers." In acknowledging that there was any press coverage at all, Clinton contradicts his recent statement that there was "nothing in the media" the day after the report was released. Nevertheless, his larger point seems to be that the press coverage of the event was severely lacking. So, is Clinton’s claim of "stunning nondisclosure" factual? The answer is slightly murky, since it’s unclear when the report’s findings came to light, and therefore how quickly news organizations responded to it. There exists a preliminary report dated to April 24, 1995, but it does not appear to have been released to the media at the time (more on this below). It seems more likely that Clinton is referring to the Dec. 13, 1995, report to the RTC, which concluded, "It is recommended that no further resources be expended on the Whitewater part of the investigation." The earliest media mention we could find of the December report is from the Dec. 16, 1995, Washington Post story that Clinton mentions in his book. The story focused on the White House easing conditions for the release of certain documents, noting that the report was sent to congressional committees two days earlier. Over the next week, articles about the Pillsbury report trickled out. On Dec. 18, both the Wall Street Journal and the San Jose Mercury News ran short stories, less than 150 words, giving succinct summaries of the report. The next day, ABC’s evening news program Nightline briefly discussed the findings, while the New York Times, like the Washington Post, mentioned the report within a larger story on missing Whitewater files. Later that week, the New York Times’ Sunday edition contained a story focused solely on the Pillsbury report. On Dec. 20, the New York Daily News ran two editorials on the Pillsbury report, one giving a nod and the other exploring the findings at length. So there was some press coverage, even if it wasn’t sufficiently exculpatory for Clinton’s taste. In fact, Howard Kurtz, in an editorial for the Washington Post on Dec. 22 (one praised by Clinton in his autobiography) discussed why there was scant media attention. Kurtz quoted several reporters from major newspapers as saying that the report was old news — a draft had been leaked that June — and beside the point: Attention to the Clintons’ participation in the land venture itself had dissipated, replaced instead by questions surrounding Hillary Clinton’s role as legal adviser to Madison Guaranty, the firm embroiled in the real estate deals surrounding the scandal. That particular issue would not be resolved until the Dec. 28 report on Clinton’s Rose Law Firm was released, which concluded on a similar note to the other report: "It is recommended that no further resources be expended on this investigation." We looked back to see if it was true that the December report’s findings had already been covered in the summer, and discovered that it was: Seven different newspapers wrote about the April 24 Pillsbury report on June 26 or 27, with the Washington Post devoting two separate stories to the issue. Kurtz’s article also supplies another reason why media outlets might have been reluctant to devote too much coverage to the Pillsbury report, even after its findings were made public in December: It wasn’t available to them in its entirety. "As soon as we can get ahold of the report, it's our intention to write an article about it," a New York Times editor told Kurtz, "There's a lot of spin that goes along with these reports. That's why you have to look at them." The New York Daily News, in its article from Dec. 20, gives the reason for this, writing that the report "was shown to the Daily News by congressional Democrats," but "the not-guilty verdict cannot be made public. It contains advice on how to prosecute other Arkansas figures, including their business partner James McDougal, and the government does not want that information to fall into the hands of defense attorneys." Our ruling Bill Clinton said that after a federal inquiry substantially cleared Hillary Clinton on the Whitewater scandal, "The next day, there was nothing in the media about it. There was stunning nondisclosure." While the former president might technically be correct — after the Dec. 13 report was sent to Congress, nothing appeared in the papers the following day — there was some amount of press coverage over the following week and a half, including a discussion of why that press coverage was not more amplified, a discussion that Clinton himself acknowledges in his autobiography. Additionally, there had been substantial press coverage of the findings of a preliminary report once the media managed to obtain information from it. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.

pomt-02185	"95 percent of the income gains in the last few years have gone to the top 1 percent."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/27/neera-tanden/tanden-95-percent-income-gains-last-few-years-have/	With most political handicappers giving Republicans the edge in the 2014 midterm elections, the pundits get to debate whether Democrats can rally their base and beat the odds. A primary question is whether the country’s struggle with income inequality offers the Democratic party the toe hold with voters that it needs. Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s new book A Fighting Chance gave the panelists on NBC’s Meet the Press an opening to bat this about. Neera Tanden, head of the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning group, argued that the issue not only would work well among the party faithful but beyond. "95 percent of the income gains in the last few years have gone to the top 1 percent, That's a fact in the country," Tanden said. "I think this is going to be an issue on both the right and the left." The claim that the top earners have done extremely well coming out of the Great Recession has come up before. While there is some debate over the details, in large measure, Tanden is on solid ground. The statement goes back to a study from University of California-Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez. In the years from 2009 to 2012, Saez found that the income flowing to families in the top 1 percent of families went up by over 30 percent, while for the rest, income grew by less than half a percent. "Hence, the top 1 percent captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery," Saez wrote. The main caveat with Saez’s work is that he used preliminary data for 2012 and didn’t include two significant kinds of income -- money from the government (Social Security, welfare, food stamps, etc.) or the value of health insurance benefits. Saez focused on employment wages, capital gains, dividends and interest. So Tanden has her numbers right by Saez’s figuring, but what you count as income makes a difference. We’ll now walk you through some other ways of looking at this question. Other interpretations, analysis We came across a study that measured income differently than Saez -- by measuring capital gains regardless of whether the owner cashed out and including government assistance programs. That study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found a wide income disparity as well, but noted that the gap actually narrowed between 1989 and 2007. There’s another argument that it makes more sense to calculate consumption rather than income. Economist Aparna Marthur with the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market oriented think-tank in Washington, believes what people spend shows you how well people are actually living, and it doesn’t matter if they pay for it using credit cards, their weekly paycheck or their savings. Viewed this way, the situation is not as bad. "We find that consumption inequality is much narrower than income inequality," Marthur said. "And has shown no trend towards widening over the last few decades." Marthur’s perspective is fuel for a policy debate that goes far beyond what we are writing about here, but there is one other criticism of Saez’s analysis. Eugene Steurele, a fellow at the Urban Institute, a D.C-based academic center, warned about using 2009, the very bottom of the recession, as the starting point. "The economic cycle messes up this comparison," Steurele told PunditFact in January. "In recovering from a recession, if an unemployed person stays with the same unemployment benefits, and a wage earner doesn’t increase her wages, but the stock market recovers enough so there are more capital gains, then one might get these types of results." Steurele said Saez’s findings are useful but his approach simplifies a complex situation. Work by the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy analysis arm of Congress, goes at least part way toward addressing Steurele’s concern. A 2011 report chose two points at the same place in the economic cycle, 1996 and 2006. It also factored in taxes and if its results are not exactly comparable to the Saez article, they point in the same direction. "The poorest tax filers (the bottom fifth) saw average after-tax income fall by 6 percent between 1996 and 2006," the report said. While "the richest 1 percent of tax filers experienced a 74 percent increase in after-tax income." The main reason for the widening gap was the rapid growth in capital gains and dividends income among the wealthy, the Congressional Research Service concluded. The latest annual review of data by the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality found that "after the Great Recession ended in mid-2009, income and consumption inequality increased." The report noted that households in the bottom fifth of the income ladder received 3.4 percent of all income in 2012. However, going back to the pundits' debate over how this will play out in the voting booth, one statistic might give the Democrats some concern. The Pew Research Center, an independent study group, found that Americans are not too worried about income inequality. In the center’s 2013 survey of global attitudes, barely half of Americans said the rich-poor gap is a very big problem. Our ruling Tanden said that 95 percent of the income gains have gone to the top 1 percent of earners. Tanden accurately reflected the findings of a much publicized report. Other studies confirm the overall trend in that report, although the disparities in gains between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else are not always as large as Tanden said and depend on how you define income. Tanden’s statement is accurate but in need of clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Neera Tanden	None	None	None	2014-04-27T15:55:37	2014-04-27	['None']
pomt-08923	Says Bill White's program to bring dropouts back to school was "so successful that almost every city in our state has replicated" it.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/27/leticia-van-de-putte/leticia-van-de-putte-says-bill-whites-efforts-cut-/	State Sen. Leticia Van de Putte praised gubernatorial candidate Bill White, a fellow Democrat, for his efforts to get dropouts back into classrooms during a speech last month to her party's convention in Corpus Christi. He "went door to door in Houston luring and asking those dropouts to come back to school," she said June 25. "Those programs were so successful that almost every city in our state has replicated what Bill White started." We wondered whether the former mayor of Houston's education initiative had really become so widespread. In response to our inquiry, Van de Putte's office pointed us to the website for Expectation Graduation, a program that White and his wife, Andrea, helped create in 2004 -- his first year as Houston mayor -- to reduce dropout rates. Part of the program's strategy is an annual Reach Out to Dropouts walk during which volunteers visit the homes of students who have not come back to school and encourage them to return. Linda Clarke, who served as White's director of education and special projects when he was mayor, said one goal of the walk is to help kids deal with the issues that keep them out of school, such as finding child care for teen mothers. The first walk was held in the Houston school district in 2004, and Clarke said Bill White has participated in each one. Mark Cueva, assistant to the deputy chief of staff in the office of Houston Mayor Annise Parker, said the walks first went statewide in 2008, when other major cities in Texas -- excluding Austin -- and their respective school districts held their own versions: Corpus Christi, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth and San Antonio. Five small cities in the Houston area also participated: Baytown, Galena Park, Richmond, Rosenberg, and Stafford. Last year, Midland joined the group, as did eight additional small cities near Houston. That brings the total number of Texas cities to 20. According to the Texas Almanac online, which is maintained by the Texas State Historical Association, the state has about 1,200 incorporated cities. So, less than 2 percent of the state's cities are replicators of the White-founded outreach program. On Tuesday, the White campaign released a Web video highlighting White's involvement with the Reach Out to Dropouts walk and its spread to big cities across the state. The campaign video also says that the Reach Out to Dropouts walk has brought more than 8,000 students back to school in Houston. Clarke said that number is a cumulative total based on reports by participating Houston-area school districts. When we asked Clarke, who is on the board of the nonprofit group that runs Expectation Graduation, about Van de Putte's statement that "almost every city in our state" has replicated the Reach Out program, she questioned the broad sweep of that assertion, and said her organization has always been clear about the number of cities participating. Van de Putte's press secretary, Kathryn Freeman, told us that the senator had gone off her prepared remarks during that part of the speech, which "simply stated that the program was so successful it was replicated across Texas." However, based on the expansion of the walk in the past two years, Freeman argued that the senator's "larger point is true, that Bill White began a program to try and address the dropout crisis in Houston that was successful and therefore replicated." We agree. Although Van de Putte clearly overstated the expansion of the Reach Out to Dropouts walk, it has been duplicated in most of the biggest cities in the state. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-00747	The Hyde Amendment "language was in the (human trafficking) bill. The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-and-juan-williams-argue-over-loretta-lyn/	This past week, President Barack Obama pressured Senate Republicans to schedule a vote to confirm his nominee for attorney general, Loretta Lynch. But the confirmation is stuck behind a stalled anti-human trafficking bill. The bipartisan bill hit an unexpected road bump in March when Senate Democrats accused Republicans of sneaking in a provision that restricts federal spending on abortions, while Republicans accused them of not reading the bill thoroughly. The issue resurfaced on the Sunday talk shows April 19, since Republicans have said they would not confirm Lynch until the human trafficking bill passes. By and large, the Republicans want the abortion spending restrictions, and Democrats don't. "The Republicans hid this language," said Fox News Sunday pundit Juan Williams of the abortion provision. "The language was in the bill," responded Republican strategist Karl Rove, after some crosstalk. "The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it." Because the question about the origins of the anti-abortion provision have re-emerged, we wanted to take a look into Rove’s statement that the language was in there, and that a Democratic sponsor knew about it. The Hyde Amendment So what is an anti-abortion rule doing in a bill designed to increase compensation for human trafficking victims and to raise consequences for the traffickers? The provision is called the Hyde Amendment, which first passed about 40 years ago and is named after the original sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. The amendment bars federal funding for most abortions. Lawmakers have worked it into many pieces of legislation, including every appropriations bill since 1976, to explicitly prevent those funds from going toward abortions. So the trafficking bill’s Republican authors worked in a reference to the Hyde Amendment into the bill. The bill doesn’t plainly say anything about abortion or the Hyde Amendment. Rather it says, "Amounts in the Fund, or otherwise transferred from the Fund, shall be subject to the limitations on the use or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014." (Those sections of the appropriations act are Hyde limitations.) But Senate Democrats didn’t notice that this was in the bill until after the Senate Judiciary Committee passed it unanimously in late February. The Democrats accused the Republicans of hoodwinking them. The Senate debated a version of the bill last year, and that version did not include Hyde Amendment language, and they said Republicans didn’t let them know about the change. In January, a Republican Judiciary Committee staffer emailed the Democratic counterpart a summary of changes, but the list did not mention the addition of the abortion language, according to the Washington Post. So who was Rove referring to when he said, "The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it"? A spokesperson for Rove told us he was referring to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a member of the Judiciary Committee and one of the original cosponsors of the bill. Klobuchar’s office released a statement on March 18 saying that a staffer in Klobuchar’s office had known about the insertion of the Hyde Amendment before the Senate Judiciary Committee vote but "did not inform the senator." "The senator was not aware that the provision was included" when she voted for the bill in committee, the statement said. So, yes, Klobuchar’s office says a staffer knew the measure was in the bill. And Klobuchar did vote for it. But Rove is pushing things by linking the two events so closely together. There is no evidence Klobuchar knew the measure was in the bill and voted for it anyway -- which is what you might interpret Rove’s statement to mean. And Klobuchar has voted to block a final vote on the bill since the provision became widely known. We asked a couple legislative experts if the Democrats’ claim that they were hoodwinked passed muster, and they said both parties are to blame. The Democrats didn’t do their due diligence in thoroughly reading the bill, but the Republicans weren’t as upfront as they could have been in regards to adding in the Hyde language, said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Really, this is bad staff work all around," said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. Our ruling Rove said the Hyde Amendment "language was in the bill. The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it." The abortion language was indeed in the human trafficking bill considered this year, though it was not in a similar bill considered last year. A Democratic staffer was aware it was in the bill, but that message wasn’t conveyed up the food chain. The only flaw in Rove’s statement is the suggestion that the Democratic sponsor, Klobuchar knew about the language and voted for it anyway. There is no evidence of that. Rove’s statement needs that clarifying detail. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2015-04-19T18:53:42	2015-04-19	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Hyde_Amendment']
pomt-12334	"Obamacare premiums have doubled" in Wisconsin.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/15/donald-trump/donald-trumps-claim-about-obamacare-premiums-doubl/	On his second visit to Wisconsin since entering the Oval Office, President Donald Trump stepped off Air Force One on June 13, 2017, and tore into Obamacare. Joined by two Wisconsin families whom he described as victims of the Affordable Care Act, Trump said in Milwaukee: "These are sad but familiar stories in Wisconsin, where Obamacare premiums have doubled. Obamacare is one of the greatest catastrophes that our country has signed into law." By not stating a time frame with his claim, the president left it to his audience to determine how alarmed to be; premiums doubling in one year, of course, is much different than over a span of years. And premium increases can’t be considered in isolation. So, let’s sort this out. Obamacare vs. GOP plan Three days before Trump’s trip, Vice President Mike Pence visited Milwaukee, saying that under the Republican replacement for Obamacare everyone with preexisting medical conditions will "have access to the coverage and the care that they need -- no exceptions." We found the pledge misleading. Based on the GOP plan passed by the House of Representatives, people with preexisting conditions could potentially face huge increases in premiums, though changes in the bill could still be made by the Senate. Around the country, there have been huge premium increases for people who buy health insurance on their own through Obamacare. We rated Mostly True a January 2017 claim by House Speaker Paul Ryan that Obamacare premiums had gone up as much as 116 percent (in Arizona) from 2016 to 2017 -- though it’s important to note that before Obamacare, millions had no coverage at all. But there are multiple problems with the president’s claim. Trump’s evidence The vast majority of Americans get health insurance through their employer or through a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare. So, Trump’s claim refers to the relatively few people who buy health insurance coverage on their own. The White House pointed us to a May 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that compared premiums in the individual market in 2013 to 2017. The report says 2013 was chosen because that’s when key regulations that are part of Obamacare took effect. The average premium in Wisconsin nearly doubled, based on the analysis: Obamacare individual market 2013 average monthly premium 2017 average monthly premium Increase Wisconsin $266 $514 93% United States $232 $476 105% But Cynthia Cox, a health reform and private insurance expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care, told us the analysis is skewed in a way that inflates the average premium for 2017 because it includes only policies that are sold in the Obamacare marketplace. The average 2017 premium would have been lower had the analysis also included individual policies that are not sold on the marketplace. That's because people who buy individual policies off the marketplace tend to buy less expensive plans because they aren't receiving Obamacare subsidies, she said. Other factors There are two other key factors to consider. 1. Obamacare subsidies offset much of the impact of premium hikes. In a news article on premium increases for 2017, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that tens of thousands of Wisconsinites who buy individual health plans, but earn too much income to qualify for Obamacare subsidies, would have to absorb double-digit increases. But the story also said that because of the subsidies, most people buying those policies would see little, if any, change in their monthly costs. Economist Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under Republican President George H.W. Bush, told us the same is true nationally: People buying individual policies on the exchange are mostly protected from premium increases, though the subsidies that rise along with premium increases are a hit to other taxpayers. 2. Coverage: Premiums are up, but benefits are better. Before Obamacare, millions of Americans had no health insurance and policies on the individual market offered "very limited benefits," University of North Carolina social medicine professor Jonathan Oberlander told us. For example, most of those policies didn’t cover maternity, mental health and substance abuse services. But now insurers are required to cover those services. The federal government estimates that 83 percent of Wisconsin marketplace participants receive premium tax credit subsidies and 51 percent receive cost-sharing subsidies. "For these residents, nongroup insurance today provides more protection for less money than in 2013," said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at Kaiser. Our rating Trump says "Obamacare premiums have doubled" in Wisconsin. The average premium for individuals who buy their own health insurance in the Obamacare marketplace nearly doubled from 2013 to 2017. But the vast majority of Wisconsin residents buying those plans get Obamacare subsidies that protect them from the premium increases. Moreover, insurance coverage on individual plans is generally more comprehensive than before Obamacare. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

pomt-05120	The DREAM Act "was written by members of both parties. When it came up for a vote a year and a half ago, Republicans in Congress blocked it. The bill hadn’t changed. ... The only thing that had changed was politics."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/26/barack-obama/obama-says-dream-act-hasnt-changed-republicans-sup/	The debate over immigration was revived by President Barack Obama’s announcement of a reprieve for the children of illegal immigrants. So, too, was talk of the DREAM Act. In a speech to Hispanic elected officials in Orlando on June 22, 2012, Obama criticized Congress’ inaction on the bill. "We should have passed the DREAM Act a long time ago," he said. "It was written by members of both parties. When it came up for a vote a year and a half ago, Republicans in Congress blocked it. The bill hadn’t changed. The need hadn’t changed. The only thing that had changed was politics." We decided to check Obama’s history on the DREAM Act. The federal Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act pertains to children brought to the U.S. illegally by parents or relatives. If the young people have stayed out of trouble and were in school or the military, the legislation would allow them to move to legal status and not be deported. It has been proposed every year for more than a decade but never passed Congress. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, introduced the original bill in 2001, along with Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. It drew 18 co-sponsors, Democrats and Republicans. Obama was correct that the legislation was written by both parties. The more recent vote he referred to took place in December 2010. The House passed the DREAM Act by 216-198. Only eight Republicans voted for it; 160 voted against. In the Senate, it could not garner the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster and died 55-41 on Dec. 18, 2010, largely along party lines. The Republicans who voted for it were Richard Lugar, R-Indiana; Bob Bennett of Utah, who had already lost his Senate seat; and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, who kept hers by running as a write-in candidate after losing in the primary. But we should also note that five Democrats voted against it. Those five votes could have gotten the DREAM Act to a floor vote. So how much has it changed in all this time? Durbin’s office provided us with a list of revisions, which were made at the request of Republicans. They included: • Lowering the age cap from 35 to 30 on who could be eligible. • Specifically excluding anyone who has committed one felony or three misdemeanors; has engaged in voter fraud or marriage fraud; or has abused a student visa. • Requiring a medical exam and background check. • Requiring applicants to speak, read and write English. In other words, the changes tightened eligibility standards and made the law stricter overall, which would support Obama’s point. Roy Beck, president and founder of Numbers USA, which advocates for the interests of American workers in immigration legislation, acknowledged that changes to the law over time addressed "loopholes." "I think it’s correct there were some improvements in that area," he said. But Beck also noted that the original version of the bill set the age cap at 21. It was raised to 35 in subsequent years, then lowered back to 30. "The age limit has varied quite a bit, and that’s not small," Beck said. "How many people are you going to be adding to the workforce to compete with Americans?" Frank Sharry of America’s Voice, a group that favors comprehensive immigration reform and passage of the DREAM Act, agreed that there were "small changes" to the bill. Sharry pointed out that the age limit has been raised to accommodate immigrants who were 21 when the bill was first introduced, so they would still be eligible. He said Durbin then lowered the cap to try to attract more votes in Congress. As for the politics surrounding the bill, that has certainly changed. Some Republicans who supported the DREAM Act are no longer in the Senate or have lost primaries, including Indiana’s Richard Lugar and Bob Bennett of Utah, swept out by the tea party movement, which generally shows little tolerance for any form of amnesty and advocates deporting illegal immigrants and building a border fence. Others who supported the bill early on have now backed away, including Hatch, the original sponsor. When the Senate bill was introduced in 2011, not a single Republican signed on. Depending on your point of view, that could be good or bad. Said Beck: "They have changed their mind on some of these things, but good for them." He argues that the economic downturn was the driving force for many Republicans’ change of heart. In 2001, "we we didn’t have 20 million Americans who were unemployed or forced into part-time work," Beck said. "I think through the years as the numbers got larger, they became aware of how out of sync an amnesty like this is with high unemployment." Our ruling Obama said the DREAM Act was written by members of both parties and since then has been blocked by Republicans, even though "the bill hadn’t changed, the need hadn’t changed. The only thing that had changed was politics." The president is correct that Democrats and Republicans worked on the original bill and it had bipartisan support in Congress for several years, though never enough to pass. In 2010, most of the opposition was on the Republican side, but five Democrats helped sustain the filibuster in the Senate. And there have been minor changes to the legislation, most importantly an increase in the age cap from 21 to 30. Other revisions made the bill more restrictive, and thus in theory more appealing to conservatives. Finally, there’s no question that the political debate about immigration has evolved, with the tea party surge crowding out more moderate viewpoints and even pushing some Republicans out of office. Obama’s comment glosses over some of the details, but his statement is largely correct. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-10828	"Each year, 18,000 people die in America because they don't have health care."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/18/hillary-clinton/indeed-uninsured-people-have-higher-mortality-rate/	The full quote from Sen. Hillary Clinton's speech on her health care plan: "Each year, 18,000 people die in America because they don't have health care. Let me repeat that. Here in America, people are dying because they couldn't get the care they needed when they were sick." Clinton used the number to dramatize the need for universal coverage. The number comes from a report called "Care Without Coverage: Too Little, Too Late," produced in 2002 by the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine. The National Academy of Science is a private, nonprofit society of scholars. It was granted a charter by Congress in 1863 and has a mandate to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. The report found that people without health care coverage: • received less frequent or no use of cancer screening tests; • received inconsistent care for the management of chronic disease; • received fewer diagnostic and treatment services for trauma or heart attacks, and had an increased risk of death when in the hospital. The report concluded that "excess deaths among uninsured adults ages 25–64, based on a 25 percent higher mortality risk, can be estimated to be in the range of 18,000 each year." The report was independently reviewed. Its findings controlled for an individual's health insurance status as an independent variable, ruling out issues of income, for instance.

pomt-08308	"Congressman Perriello voted in lock step with Nancy Pelosi 90 percent of the time."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/30/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-tom-perriello-voted-lock-step-nan/	In congressional races across the country, Republicans are trying to link Democratswith House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been demonized by GOP leaders. One example can be found in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, where the Republican challenger, state Sen. Robert Hurt, has repeatedly lashed out at Democratic incumbent Rep. Tom Perriello for his alleged loyalty to the House speaker, particularly on high-profile issues. In a recent posting on Hurt’s website, his campaign lays out a "Breakdown of Congressman Perriello’s actions while in Congress." Second on the list: "Congressman Perriello voted in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi 90 percent of the time, 100 percent of the time on the signature issues that kill jobs, increase Washington’s reckless spending spree, and vastly expand the size and scope of the federal government." Having found that similar claims in other states were exaggerated, PolitiFact Virginia decided to check the assertion that Perriello voted with Pelosi 90 percent of the time. Asked for the source of the claim, Hurt’s campaign pointed to the same Washington Post congressional voting database that has been cited as the foundation for similar claims in other races. But that’s where the claim begins to stray from the truth. While that database measures the the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members, it does not measure how often they agree with a particular party leader. A look at the database reveals that Perriello voted with his party 90.4 percent of the time, so we set about the task of finding out how often he voted in with Pelosi specifically. Because House Speakers rarely vote, Pelosi has only cast 94 votes since the start of 2009, while Perriello has cast 1,502. So we measured the number of times Perriello has agreed with Pelosi on matters where both recorded votes. Of the 88 times, excluding procedural roll calls, where both have voted, Perriello went against Pelosi 19 times, making his true record of following the House Speaker’s lead 78.4 percent. That’s significantly lower than 90 percent. Hurt’s campaign is correct that the two voted together on some major Democratic initiatives -- the stimulus package, health care and cap and trade. But Perriello did notably dissent from Pelosi and his party on the Wall Street bailout. In fact, of Virginia’s 11 members of Congress, Perriello breaks rank more than anyone else other than Rep. Glenn Nye, a Democrat from Hampton Roads. The average party loyalty of all 444 House members on votes over the past two years is 90.6 percent, so by that measure, Perriello is typical. But he’s less faithful than the average Democrat, who votes with the party 92.2 percent of the time. Amanda Henneberg, Hurt’s spokeswoman, said voting with the Democratic Party is the equivalent of voting with Pelosi since she is the party’s House leader and has voted with her party 100 percent of the time. Furthermore, Henneberg notes that Pelosi has not missed any votes, but has chosen not to participate in the traditional sense when it didn’t matter. University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said that if the House Speaker did vote on every issue, the claim would have more truth. "A good case can be made that the recorded number is only part of the real, larger story," he said. "Our Congress today is so partisan that almost all Democrats vote together on anything important, and almost all Republicans vote the other way. The Speaker would side with her party every time ... So you don't get the full picture with the 94 recorded votes." So let’s recap. First, the Hurt campaign says Perriello voted with Pelosi 90 percent of the time, which is incorrect. He voted with his party 90 percent, but voted with Pelosi only 78.4 percent, which is significantly lower. Still, there is support for Hurt’s underlying point that Perriello votes with his party much of the time. So we find the claim Half True.

pomt-10745	"I've got the most international experience here."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/04/bill-richardson/yes-hes-got-experience-but-the-most-/	At a Democratic debate in Philadelphia on Oct. 30, Gov. Bill Richardson tried some global one-upsmanship. "I've got the most international experience here," he said. That message is a central plank in his campaign. He not only has executive experience running the state of New Mexico and 15 years in Congress, he's got foreign policy experience. (Our in-depth look at the candidates' experience can be found in our story here.) Indeed, in 1997, President Clinton appointed Richardson ambassador to the United Nations, where he stayed for 1 1/2 years. He has also, on several occasions, gone overseas to negotiate the release of American political prisoners and servicemen in North Korea, Iraq and Cuba. In 1995, he negotiated with Saddam Hussein for the release of two American hostages. And he negotiated a cease-fire, later breached, among several factions in the Darfur region of Sudan. This year, Richardson led a delegation to North Korea that included President Bush's main policy adviser on North Korea. Afterward, North Korea said it would shut its main nuclear reactor once it received $25-million frozen in a bank by sanctions. A few deadlines lapsed, but the United States is working with North Korea to remove it from Washington's list of states sponsoring terrorism as American experts prepare to disable the nation's nuclear reactor. Whether this stage of negotiations is a result of Richardson's skills as a diplomat, or if officials like U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill are more responsible, goes beyond the scope of our question. But this experience definitely gives him some foreign policy cred. Compare his resume against the records of most of the other Democratic candidates and he definitely has more international experience. But what about Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware? He's spent 35 years in the Senate. He's chairman of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee, a post he held following the 9/11 attacks. His proposal to divide Iraq has considerable support from people in both parties. So it's a stretch for Richardson to claim he's No. 1. We recognize he has lots of foreign policy experience, but given his brief time as U.N. ambassador and Biden's significant experience, we find Richardson's statement to be Half True.

pomt-15052	"Six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/29/mike-huckabee/huckabee-says-six-10-wealthiest-us-counties-surrou/	Mike Huckabee says he’s found the road to riches, and it’s called the Capital Beltway. "Six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C.," the GOP presidential candidate said during a Sept. 24 interview on "The John Fredericks Show," a Hampton Roads-based radio program. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, cited the statistic while contending that federal power brokers have set up a system that shields them from economic hard times. We emailed Huckabee’s campaign asking for the source of his numbers and didn’t hear back. But PolitiFact has examined variations of his statement that have been uttered by three other Republicans: Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and, most recently, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. The six-of-10 figure is a reference to the counties with the highest median household income, a widely used measure of county-wide wealth. The U.S. Census Bureau compiles the income data each year. Here are the 10 counties with the highest median income in 2013, the latest year for which figures are available: Loudoun County, Va. -- $117,680 Falls Church, Va. -- $117,452 Los Alamos County, N.M. -- $110,930 Fairfax County, Va. -- $110,658 Howard County, Md. -- $108,503 Hunterdon County, N.J -- $107,203 Douglas County, Colo. -- $105,192 Arlington County, Va. -- $101,533 Morris County, N.J. -- $99,950 Montgomery County, Md. -- $97,873 That list includes six counties -- four in Virginia and two in Maryland -- that are located outside Washington. Although Falls Church is a city, it’s treated as a county by the Census Bureau. We looked at the annual Census Bureau figures going back to 2009. In each of those years, there also were a half-dozen D.C. suburban counties that made the top 10 list of the highest median household income. It’s no secret that the federal government is the major seed of affluence in the D.C. area, sprouting high-paying government and contracting jobs. The suburbs have some of the highest education levels in the nation, according to Terry Rephann, a regional economist at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. We should make a statistical note here. Median household income is the midrange point where half of the county’s households make more than the median and the other half makes less. For example, if only five families lived in a county, the median income would be that of the third highest-earning household. Not all measures rank the D.C. suburbs among the 10 richest counties. Money magazine, for example, looked at average income -- the total income in a county divided by its residents. Based on that data from 2012, none of the counties near Washington made a Money list of the 10 richest counties published last year. If you’re wondering, No. 1 in was Teton County in Wyoming. Rephann, however, told us that average income can easily be thrown off by a few extremely wealthy people living in a less populous rural county. Median income is a better way to measure the richest counties, he said. We’ll also note that while median incomes are high around Washington, that doesn’t mean everything is rosy there. Economists told us for a recent fact-check that the Virginia economy has taken a hit in recent years amid federal budget-cutting in D.C. Our ruling Huckabee said six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C. Judged by median household income -- a standard way for tracking a county’s wealth -- his statement is correct. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06372	Proposition 2 on November’s Texas ballot "does not cost state taxpayers any money."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/nov/03/H204TEXAS-PAC/Group-says-proposed-constitutional-amendment-costs/	An email blast advocating for a proposed constitutional amendment on the Nov. 8, 2011, Texas ballot says Proposition 2 will help "build critical local water supply projects that create jobs and protect us from drought and wildfire." The email from Texans 4 Prop 2, funded by the H2O4TEXAS political action committee, goes on: "This does not cost state taxpayers any money. Yes, that’s right, Prop 2 advances critical, job-creating local water projects at no cost to state taxpayers." Residents of communities benefiting from the requested $6 billion boost in bonding authority would pay such debt costs. We wondered if state taxpayers would be scot-free. The proposition, among 10 changes to the constitution placed before voters by state lawmakers, would authorize the Texas Water Development Board to issue additional general obligation bonds on a continuing basis for one or more accounts of the Texas Water Development Fund II, according to an explanatory statement from the state. According to a July 2011 House Research Organization background paper on the proposition, the bonds are "self-supporting.They require no draw on (state) general revenue," meaning revenue ponied up from state taxpayers, "but use the state’s superior credit rating to finance water and wastewater projects for public entities — including cities, districts, and nonprofit water supply corporations — at a lower interest rate than the entities could receive with other financing." To date, non-self-supporting bonds approved by lawmakers have required state revenue to cover a portion of the interest on the bonds. After asking the pro-proposition group for backup information, we interviewed Melanie Callahan, the board’s interim executive administrator, who said the reason there’s no state cost for such self-supporting bonds is that debt on the bonds is repaid by the benefiting entities. To date, she said, no jurisdictions have defaulted on such payments. Case closed? Not quite, we realized. Two analyses of the proposal -- a fiscal note written by the Legislative Budget Board when lawmakers were acting last spring and a description of the ballot proposal by the Texas Legislative Council, which helps legislators draft proposals -- state that Proposition 2 allows legislators to appropriate money to pay debt service on the bonds. If so, we surmised, any such appropriation would pose a cost to state taxpayers. Generally, the fiscal note says, the proposed amendment has no "significant fiscal implication to the state... other than the cost of publication" on the ballot, $105,495. However, the note says, the proposal "includes bond authority that would comprise a mixture of self-supporting debt and non-self-supporting debt," meaning debt not covered by the benefiting jurisdictions repaying the state. "Any non-self-supporting debt that receives a General Revenue appropriation for debt service," the note says, "would impact the state's constitutional debt limit," meaning it would be a cost to the state and its taxpayers. The note continues by saying the water-development board can only issue such non-self-supporting debt with legislative authorization. The council’s analysis includes similar language. In interviews, a board staff spokesman, John Barton, and the council’s chief legislative counsel, Jeff Archer, each said the reference to legislators subsidizing debt payments reflects the established constitutional authority of Texas legislatures to appropriate money. Archer said the ballot proposition might pose "little to no risk to the state revenue. That doesn’t mean there’s no risk," meaning a future Legislature could supplement related debt payments by tapping state revenue. We checked back with the water development board. General Counsel Ken Petersen said that under the constitution, lawmakers have full power to manage the board’s financing activities by changing state law and appropriating state revenue for any purpose, including debt payments. Proposition 2 alone "does not cost state taxpayer money at all," Petersen said. "What could cost (taxpayer) money is what the people who get elected to the Legislature (in the future) choose to do... That is a choice the Legislature makes." Callahan told us lawmakers have done so before in situations when debt payments by benefiting communities would not flow quickly enough to the state to satisfy terms. More than $1.7 billion in board-overseen general-obligation bonds outstanding as of Aug. 31, 2011 consisted of $1.2 billion in self-supporting bonds, with debt not paid by state taxpayers, and nearly $528 million in non-self-supporting bonds for which legislators voted to pick up a portion of debt service, at a cost to state taxpayers, she said by email. Most recently, Callahan said, the water board got legislative permission this spring to convert $24.5 million in self-supporting bonds for the San Antonio Water System to build a brackish water desalination project into non-self-supporting bonds, with a portion of interest on the bonds consequently being paid from state revenue. "The Legislature's direction to issue non-self-supporting debt has been more prevalent in the last few years in order to help fund state water plan projects, in the absence of a dedicated funding source" for such projects, Callahan said. Of about $512 million in debt service paid by the water development board from 2008 through August 2011, about $101 million, or 20 percent, came from legislative appropriations, Callahan said, with benefiting jurisdictions covering the rest. The treasurer of the H2O4TEXAS PAC, Heather Harward, agreed that future Legislatures could spend general revenue to cover the debt service on the non-self-supporting bonds envisioned in the ballot proposal. "But as of today, based on the will of the (2011) Legislature and the direction provided to lawmakers by Texans, the bonds are completely self-supporting," Harward said by email. She added that the proposal "does not encumber any state funds." We’re ready to cash out: The group's claim sidesteps the fact that taxpayers of jurisdictions benefiting from the bonds will face bond-related costs. And while the additional bond authority sought in the proposition would not cost state taxpayers--up front--state lawmakers could still exploit their standing authority, as before, to spend state revenue on related debt. This possibility is unacknowledged in the group’s claim, which we rate Half True.	None	H204TEXAS PAC	None	None	None	2011-11-03T06:00:00	2011-10-24	['Texas']
pomt-04041	"When George Bush became president of the United States, 17 million people were in poverty. When he left, 30 million people were in poverty."	false	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/30/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-says-30-million-people-were-pover/	As a member of Congress who represents an urban area with many low-income residents, Warrensville Heights Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge has made fighting poverty one of her legislative priorities in Congress, as well as a priority of the Congressional Black Caucus she recently began to chair. On Jan. 17. Fudge joined a George Washington University panel discussion on poverty that was hosted by PBS’ Tavis Smiley. Other panelists included outspoken Union Theological Seminary professor Cornel West and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a recent Republican candidate for president. During the discussion, Fudge decried efforts to balance the federal budget by cutting aid to the poor. She argued that many of the nation’s fiscal problems were caused by two wars in the Middle East, the creation of the Medicare Part D program, and tax cuts implemented by President George W. Bush. In an effort to point out that increased needs for social service programs did not begin under President Barack Obama, Fudge said that "When George Bush became president of the United States, 17 million people were in poverty. When he left, 30 million people were in poverty." When Smiley pointed out that poverty continued to worsen during Obama’s presidency, Fudge agreed. She said neither party has done enough to fight poverty, but health care reform legislation Obama passed "significantly" helped poor people, as did money in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for programs like Head Start, Pell Grants, food stamps, and unemployment insurance. She argued problems would be worse if Obama hadn’t taken those steps. PolitiFact has periodically examined claims about poverty in the United States. The poverty numbers that Fudge cited for the Bush presidency actually sounded low to us, so we asked her office where she got them. Fudge spokeswoman Belinda Prinz replied that Fudge - the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Subcommittee that oversees the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (also known as food stamps) used statistics on the number of people using SNAP benefits during Bush’s presidency instead of numbers that described those living in poverty. She said poverty and SNAP numbers both rose during Bush’s presidency, though they didn’t increase at identical rates. SNAP benefits, with some exceptions, are available to people with incomes up to 130% of the poverty line and thus can be used to aid the near poor, including the working poor, as well as anyone classified below the poverty line, said Prinz. "It was unintentional to describe SNAP data as poverty data," Prinz’s email said. Prinz forwarded material from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that indicated 17.3 million people used food stamps when Bush took office in 2001 and that 28.2 million used them during 2008, his last year in office. By 2012, USDA figures show the number of people using the SNAP program rose to 46.6 million people. Prinz also sent a report from the Food Research and Action Center that said food stamp participation topped 31.7 million people during Bush’s last month in office, December 2008. A Congressional Budget Office report on the food stamp program attributes the dramatic rise in the program’s use to "the deep recession from December 2007 to June 2009 and the subsequent slow recovery." As Fudge’s office said, poverty rates and food stamp usage both rose during the terms of Presidents Bush and Obama. Census data shows that in 2001, the year President Bush took office, 32.9 million people - or 11.7 percent of the U.S. population - lived below the poverty level. During Bush’s last year in office, 2008, 39.8 million people or 13.2 percent of the population lived below the poverty line. By 2011 - well into Obama’s term - there were 46.2 million impoverished people, a 15 percent rate of poverty. The point that Fudge was trying to make - that poverty rose under the presidency of George Bush - is correct. But singling out Bush is misleading because poverty also has gone up under Obama. And her numbers were incorrect. Her substitution of SNAP numbers for poverty data led her to significantly understate the number of people living in poverty. We rule her statement False.

pomt-08439	Says Texas has so few gas-pump inspectors in the field, "the HEBs of this state, the Brookshires of this state, they're calibrating their own gas pumps. The (Texas Department of Agriculture) just sends them the stickers and they calibrate them."	false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/18/hank-gilbert/hank-gilbert-pitching-reorganization-state-agency-/	Hank Gilbert, the Democratic nominee for state agriculture commissioner, has hammered incumbent Todd Staples, a Republican, on many fronts, including his agency's performance inspecting gas pumps to make sure they work right. PolitiFact Texas just checked his September claim that pumps in each of the state's five Texas Department of Agriculture regions lack required state stickers or have stickers that are out of date. We rated that statement Half True. But today's venture into the state's vast span o' pumps was touched off by an Aug. 20 press release from Staples' campaign bringing to light a video of Gilbert at the Central Texas Democratic Forum on Jan. 11--yes, January. That's when he told the Dems that he'd fire about half the agriculture department's employees at headquarters in order to hire "people to put in the field because that's where we need it. Because right now we have so little people in the field, the HEBs of this state, the Brookshires of this state, they're calibrating their own gas pumps. The TDA just sends them the stickers and they calibrate them. So we literally do have the fox guarding the hen house. That's got to stop." We wondered how such a dramatic statement had slipped past us. Has anyone else noticed that the state sends stickers to stores that calibrate their own pumps? Are things that cozy? Responding to our query, Gilbert's campaign manager, Vince Leibowitz, said in an e-mail that both HEB and Brookshire independently have their gas pumps certified between state inspections. Per Gilbert's statement that the agriculture department "sends them the stickers," Leibowitz said Gilbert wasn't referring to the state inspection seals, which he said can only be affixed by agency employees. Leibowitz said Gilbert meant "independent inspector" stickers--again, not the same as state stickers--which he said Gilbert has seen on Brookshire pumps in East Texas. However, Leibowitz said, "to our knowledge, TDA does not send out those stickers. Hank misspoke." Asked if Gilbert subsequently issued a correction or retraction, Leibowitz replied by e-mail that "someone approached him after this to talk to him about it, and he clarified what he intended to say. He has since not similarly misspoken and has talked about gas pumps dozens and dozens of times on the stump." Hot on this sticker trail, we checked with the Texas Department of Agriculture whose spokesman, Bryan Black, said its inspectors are the only personnel authorized to inspect a fuel pump and apply its "weights and measure seal. That is the law and that is our policy." Stores of all sizes must calibrate their pumps by using registered service technicians, licensed by the TDA, Black said. State law requires each pump to be inspected every four years, he said, though since 2007, the average time between inspections has been 2.6 years. A TDA Web page says the department has 72 weights and measures inspectors throughout the state checking more than 65,000 fuel pumps a year. Leibowitz said Gilbert foresees eliminating various agency positions and using the savings to hire more field inspectors, but that it's "inappropriate and premature" to detail those plans. Next, we queried HEB and Brookshire about their gas pumps. Both told us they contract the calibration of their pumps to outside vendors. Explained Sam Anderson, spokesman for the Tyler-based Brookshire Grocery Company: "If they pass (state) inspection, the Department of Agriculture provides their stickers. If we are not compliant, we have to have our service provider come back out to fix them. Then the department comes back out." In a follow-up e-mail, Anderson said the grocery store does not have its own certification stickers on its approximately 400 dispensers. So, how does the meter swing on Gilbert's statement? Stores do indeed calibrate their gas pumps--by using state-certified technicians. But Gilbert leaves the impression this practice is new and nefarious -- and a substitute for state inspections. It's not. Also, as Gilbert's campaign acknowledged to us, his statement that the state sends stickers to stores simply isn't so. Gilbert may have only said this to a single audience. Regardless, his claim--which was never corrected publicly--incorrectly suggests wrongdoing, and state complicity in that wrongdoing. On the Truth-O-Meter, that's fuel enough to rate False.

pomt-14082	Says Patrick Murphy "switched his vote on All Aboard Florida ... because his father tried to get in a bid to build it and was unsuccessful."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/may/18/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-lacks-evidence-accusation-about-patri/	U.S. Senate candidate Alan Grayson dismissed a New York Times story about his hedge fund as "full of s---" in a sit-down with CBS4’s Jim Defede, a reaction so wrong his own campaign corrected him on the facts. But that wasn’t the only attack in the interview that ran off the rails. Grayson called rival Patrick Murphy a "walking, talking crook" and zeroed in on Murphy’s wealthy businessman father, another focal point in the race between the two Democratic congressmen running for Sen. Marco Rubio’s seat. Grayson accused Murphy of flip-flopping on the passenger rail project when it snubbed a bid from builder Thomas P. Murphy Jr., owner of Coastal Construction Group. Murphy "switched his vote on All Aboard Florida and tried to destroy the program -- the only Democrat in the entire country who voted to destroy the All Aboard Florida program -- because his father tried to get in a bid to build it and was unsuccessful," Grayson said May 15. "So he went from being in favor of the program to being against the program. That’s certainly using your congressional influence. He tried to kill the entire program -- the only Democrat to do so -- because his father didn't get a contract out of it." Did Murphy really flip-flop on votes for All Aboard Florida after his father’s company lost its bid? There is no dispute that Murphy initially supported the rail project and later opposed it. There is dispute, however, over why he did it. Murphy’s campaign argues that he came out against the project as he learned more about it and heard community opposition. Grayson, who supports All Aboard Florida, points to more nefarious reasons, but he doesn’t prove his charge that it was connected to Murphy’s dad’s business. There’s also an issue with Grayson’s wording about flip-flopped "votes." There were two votes in Congress related to the financing, but Murphy consistently voted no on those votes. The Grayson campaign acknowledged to PolitiFact Florida that Murphy changed his "support" for the project, but not his votes. Coastal Construction’s role All Aboard Florida is a $3 billion passenger rail line that will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in 2017, with plans to extend it to Orlando. The owners applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan to supplement private financing but later put that request on hold. All Aboard Florida’s federal application for $1.75 billion in tax-exempt bonding authority was approved. (The state is also kicking in some money connected to the project.) An All Aboard Florida spokeswoman declined to comment about Coastal Construction’s interest. Coastal Construction along with a joint venture partner, Tishman Construction, had preliminary conversations with All Aboard Florida from October 2012 until the fall of 2013 but never submitted a bid, said Dan Whiteman, Coastal Construction vice chairman. "In early December of 2013, it was decided to no longer pursue the project," Whiteman wrote. "All Aboard Florida was advised in mid-December 2013 that we were not going to proceed any further in discussions, and we never submitted a response to their request for proposals to build the project." Asked why Coastal declined to bid on the project, Whiteman said: "Other projects came available and were starting more quickly." Whiteman said that Coastal Construction had no conversations with Rep. Murphy about the project. A spokesman for Murphy's campaign, Joshua Karp, agreed with that point. Murphy changed his stance Murphy supported All Aboard Florida in the fall of 2013 when it benefited from a $13.75 million federal grant. The state applied for the grant to improve connectivity between multiple rail operators including All Aboard Florida. "I'm a proud supporter of infrastructure projects that generate jobs and stimulate long-term economic growth just as this rail project will," Murphy said in a Sept. 13, 2013, news release. In October 2013, Murphy was one of 16 Florida members to sign a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx praising the project. They wrote it had "potential to modernize and upgrade a busy transportation corridor" and provide an economic boost. But by the spring of 2014, local opposition had grown due to fears about noise and other impacts. Resolutions from local governments and groups, such as Indian River County, the city of Port St. Lucie and the village of Tequesta, started to pile up. Ultimately, 60,000 people signed a petition against it. Murphy, who faced re-election, hopped on board the opposition train. He won his race. In March 2014, Murphy sought a meeting with Foxx to discuss constituent concerns. By April, he was an adamant opponent. In a letter to Foxx, Murphy wrote that the rail line would likely "delay emergency vehicles, create traffic jams, raise noise pollution and block waterways." Over the next several months, Murphy contacted federal and state officials, sought public hearings as well as a federal study in an effort to quash the rail line. Murphy’s changed stance drew media attention. Murphy’s chief of staff, Eric Johnson, told the TC Palm that initially the project drew local support because of the economic benefits. "But since then," Johnson is quoted as saying, "with everything (Murphy) learns, the more information he gets, the less he likes it. The more he learns, he sours on this project more." (Murphy campaign spokeswoman Galia Slayen provided a similar explanation for this fact-check.) K.C. Ingram Traylor, leader of the opposition group Florida Not All Aboard, told PolitiFact Florida, "As the facts about All Aboard Florida came to light, Rep. Murphy intelligently took another look at the project and strongly opposed it." Murphy’s votes A spokesman for Grayson, David Damron, initially argued that Grayson had specified Murphy switched his "support" and not his vote. But after PolitiFact Florida sent Damron the transcript and CBS4 video, Damron acknowledged that Grayson errantly mentioned votes. Congress didn’t get an up-or-down vote on the project. However, there were two votes on amendments offered by U.S. Rep. Bill Posey, R-Rockledge, to an appropriations bill about financing. Murphy was the lone Democrat to vote in favor of the two amendments to ban funds for the project. One amendment banned funds in general, and the other banned tax-exempt bonds. Both amendments failed by wide margins on June 9, 2015. Our ruling Grayson says Murphy "switched his vote on All Aboard Florida ... because his father tried to get in a bid to build it and was unsuccessful." There is one kernel of truth here: Murphy did switch his position on the rail project. But he did not switch his votes, which were consistently against funding for it. Murphy said he switched his vote because of community blowback to the rail project, and not as a result of his father’s business dealings. The onus is on Grayson to prove that Murphy flip-flopped because his father didn’t get a contract out of it, and he did not prove his case. The entities involved are private, which makes primary documents hard to obtain. Coastal Construction’s vice chairman said the company had preliminary talks with the private rail project but did not file a bid. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e0b39840-e841-43a1-b34d-fc6014b44a18	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2016-05-18T12:00:00	2016-05-15	['None']
pomt-07408	"90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted."	true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/28/richard-corcoran/rep-richard-corcoran-says-90-percent-prenatal-down/	Editor's note: On Feb. 27, 2012, we rated a similar claim -- phrased slightly differently -- by presidential candidate Rick Santorum and ruled it Half True. To see that ruling, click here. The use of statistics dominated a daylong debate over six abortion bills in the Florida House of Representatives on April 27, 2011. The bills, which passed the House and are being heard in the Senate, include a broader ban on third-term abortions, tighter requirements for notifying parents when a minor seeks an abortion, and a mandate that women be offered an opportunity to view and hear a description of ultrasound images before receiving an abortion. Another bill seeks to amend the state Constitution to prevent possible state funding of most abortion procedures. Among all the stats used in nearly six hours of floor speeches, one stood out. It came from Republican Rep. Richard Corcoran of New Port Richey and caught the attention of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates on Twitter. The group posted a message that said Corcoran claimed that "90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted." "PolitiFact anyone?" the group asked. We heard it, too, and spoke with Corcoran after the House adjourned. He said he found it in a couple of different places, including in a New York Times story. Corcoran's point was that we, as Americans, have to do more to try to prevent abortion. But is he right about the high percentage of abortion in these cases? Sure enough, we found the Times article Corcoran was referencing. The article from 2007 discussed how effective prenatal testing to detect Down syndrome could reduce the number of children born with the genetic condition, and how parents of children with Down syndrome were trying to convince others not to abort fetuses that tested positive for the condition. The story included almost the same line that Corcoran used -- that "about 90 percent of pregnant women who are given a Down syndrome diagnosis have chosen to have an abortion." The line was not sourced, meaning the story did not say specifically where it came from. However, the online version did include a link to an abstract of a medical study discussing abortion rates after a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The study is from 1999 by the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at King's College in London. It compiled 20 other studies measuring abortion rates and concluded that, following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, 92 percent of women chose to have an abortion. We searched and found other studies that show similar percentages. A study from researchers at Wayne State University in Michigan examined the cases of 145 pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome from 1988-97. The study found that 19 (13.1 percent) women chose continuation of the pregnancy, while 126 (86.9 percent) chose termination. Another study examined 131 prenatally diagnosed cases of Down syndrome in Hawaii from 1987-96. The study found that women in 110 of those cases (84 percent) chose to have their pregnancies terminated. That's three different medical studies, all reaching similar conclusions. Similar statistics were referenced in two books we found about prenatal testing (here and here). We asked the Guttmacher Institute, an independent research organization that analyzes data on population growth and reproductive health, if we should be aware of any other data. Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said she didn't know of anything else. That leaves us to rely on these studies, which have been cited by subsequent researchers. Corcoran said that "90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted." Though the exact numbers vary slightly, the studies back him up. We rate this statement True.

pomt-13925	"The LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group."	true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/23/loretta-lynch/loretta-lynch-says-gays-and-lesbians-are-most-freq/	The Orlando shooting massacre at the Pulse gay nightclub that led to the deaths of 49 victims has led to more national attention about hate crimes targeting the gay community. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch spoke about the attack hours later on Fox News Sunday. "I think we have to keep our eye on a larger picture here, which is the victims of this crime were from a community that is often marginalized and that, frankly, the LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group," she said. Lynch is correct if we examine per capita rates for hate crimes, although there are some caveats about the data -- mainly that there are gaps in how law enforcement reports hate crimes. The FBI defines hate crimes as "criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against" a particular group such as a religion, race or sexual orientation. Data on hate crimes A spokesman for Lynch said she was referring to an analysis by the New York Times published days after the Orlando shooting. Using data from the FBI and the U.S. Census, the newspaper compared hate crimes per capita in two years: 2005 and 2014. The newspaper found "L.G.B.T. people are twice as likely to be targeted as African-Americans, and the rate of hate crimes against them has surpassed that of crimes against Jews." Mark Potok, an expert on extremism at the Southern Poverty Law Center, did a similar analysis of 14 years of hate crime data in 2011. He found that LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people are far more likely than other minority groups to be victimized by violent hate crimes. Potok examined the percentage of the population represented by these groups: LGBT, Jews, blacks, Muslims, Latinos and whites. Then he compiled the total number of hate crimes against persons (excluding crimes against property) between 1995 and 2008. Then he compared the level of hate crime aimed at each group to the group’s percentage in the population to determine the rate of victimization. He found that LGBT people were victimized at 8.3 times the expected rate. Jews were victimized at 3.5 times the expected rate, blacks at 3.2 times, Muslims at 1.9 times, Latinos at 0.6 times, and whites at 0.2 times. An important caveat: There are several holes in the reporting of hate crimes to the FBI. Local law enforcement agencies voluntarily report their data to a state agency that compiles the information for the FBI. Some local agencies report no hate crimes or don’t submit a report. A study by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 60 percent of violent hate crime victimizations were not reported to police in 2012. A 2016 Associated Press investigation found that more than 2,700 city police and county sheriff's departments have not submitted a single hate crime report to the FBI during the past six years — about 17 percent of all city and county law enforcement agencies nationwide. Among the agencies that reported zero hate crimes in 2014 were several major cities, including Jacksonville, Miami and Tampa. Another way to look at the data about hate crimes rather than per capita is the sheer number of crimes. By that measure, there were more hate crimes against African-Americans than LGBT residents. But that’s not surprising since African-Americans represent about 13.2 percent of the population according to the U.S. Census, while the LGBT community represents about 2.3 percent of the population, according to a survey done by the Centers for Disease Control (other surveys found a slightly higher rate.) Why would LGBT be victimized at a higher rate Answering the question as to why the LGBT community would be victimized at a higher rate is more complex. Some of the crime, paradoxically, may be motivated by more widespread acceptance of gay rights. "We are seeing lots more gay people getting married," said Jack Levin, a sociologist at Northeastern University and expert on hate crimes. "I think what hate crimes represent is a reaction to that." Some are motivated by fear. "There is a visceral hatred against LGBT people in large part connected to fears about sexuality," Potok said. "Sexuality is an incredibly fraught topic for some people and especially those people who fear they might have same-sex attraction themselves." Law enforcement is still investigating the Orlando shooting, but based on information so far, experts said that the shooter appeared to be motivated in part by bigotry and self-loathing. Omar Mateen, who was married to a woman, regularly visited the gay nightclub and used gay dating apps, according to reports by patrons at the club. Our ruling Lynch said, "The LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group." It’s worth noting that there may be widespread underreporting of hate crime incidents in general. However, the best available research shows that the LGBT community is victimized at a higher rate than other minority groups, according to FBI data.

pomt-01802	"We are 49th in the nation for our graduation rate"	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/23/dennis-richardson/does-oregon-rank-49th-nation-its-high-school-gradu/	Oregon Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, hopes to unseat Democratic incumbent Gov. John Kitzhaber in November’s general election. The two met in their first debate July 18, during which Kitzhaber portrayed himself as a problem-solver who works effectively across the aisle. Richardson pointed to problems with the doomed Columbia River Crossing bridge project and the disastrous rollout of Cover Oregon, the state’s health insurance exchange. The claim: Richardson, in assessing Kitzhaber’s record in office, singled out failures of the state’s educational system. "We are 49th in the nation for our graduation rate," he said. Is Oregon nearly at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to U.S. high school graduation rates? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We emailed the Richardson campaign, which sent us a link to a Feb. 7, 2014, article by Betsy Hammond, the state education reporter for The Oregonian. The article’s headline: "Oregon’s high school graduation rate second-worst in nation." The results, from the high school class of 2012, taken from the 2011-12 school year, showed Oregon’s rate above only Nevada’s when it came to our "regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate"; that is, the percentage of students who entered the ninth grade in 2008-09 and graduated on time four years later in June 2012. The numbers came from the U.S. Department of Education’s second-ever compilation of comparable state-by-state graduation rates. For 2012, the numbers show, Nevada ranked dead last, at 63 percent, with Oregon next-worst, at 68 percent. Iowa topped the list, with an 89 percent four-year graduation rate.But three states, Idaho, Kentucky and Oklahoma, did not submit their rates, saying they lacked the ability to track all students. So Oregon was actually No. 46 out of 47 states, not No. 49. If the three other states had submitted their rates, it’s conceivable that Oregon could have climbed anywhere from one to three spots higher. For the class of 2011, Oregon’s graduation was fourth-worst among the same 47 states, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics. By in 2011-12, New Mexico and Georgia surged ahead, leaving the Beaver State a step from the basement. We called Crystal Greene, communications director for the Oregon Department of Education, who said that while the four-year rate is the gold standard, other measures exist. Those include five-year programs that allow students to remain enrolled in high school while attending community colleges, "modified" diplomas for special education students, diplomas awarded to adults, and GEDs. Including students who received modified diplomas and GEDs, she said, takes Oregon’s "completer rate" to 80 percent. But, she said, official state reports on graduation rates don’t include those numbers. The Oregonian has also found that outcomes for students who earn GEDs, in particular, are far worse than those for high school graduates, meaning the credentials are far from equivalent. Still, she acknowledged that the four-year rate -- considered by both state and federal education officials as the correct way to measure graduation rates nationally -- places Oregon near the bottom. The ruling: State Rep. Dennis Richardson, in taking on Gov. John Kitzhaber, stated during a recent debate that Oregon ranks 49th in high school graduation rates. He based the number on a news story that looked at state-by-state numbers for the 2011-12 school year from the U.S. Department of Education. The story’s headline said Oregon had the nation’s "second-worst" rate. That’s correct. But because only 47 states submitted data, it’s incorrect to say Oregon came in 49th. Richardson’s claim is close but needs clarification. We rate the claim Mostly True. Thoughts on this PolitiFact Oregon piece? Go to OregonLive.com/politics to leave your comments.

pomt-14635	"I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/27/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrong-say-shes-only-candidate-lay-/	National security has been something of a double-edged sword for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Clinton amassed extensive international experience during four years as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, but because of this, opponents can charge that she shoulders some of the blame for ongoing difficulties overseas. During a speech in Burlington, Iowa, on Jan. 20, 2016, Clinton argued that on foreign policy, she was the only candidate to offer a thorough, detailed vision for the future. "We know one threat we have to face right now, and that's from ISIS," Clinton said, referring to the group also known as the Islamic State. "And I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS." Hillary Clinton addressing a crowd in Burlington, Iowa, on Jan. 20, 2016. Clinton’s claim didn’t sound right to us because we’ve heard many candidates describe how they would take on the terrorist group. In fact-checking her statement, we aren’t taking a stance on the quality of her plan, or the other candidates’ plans, only the degree to which a candidate has laid one out. Our research found that Clinton’s plan is a bit lengthier and more detailed than the other ones we were able to locate. But she is hardly the only one to lay out a specific plan. The following table provides a rundown of the Democratic and Republican campaigns for which we found either a candidate’s speech addressing how to combat ISIS or an "issues" section of their campaign website that summarizes their views. If we found that the candidate offered both a speech and an issues Web page, we have analyzed the longer of the two. We were unable to find a written proposal for every candidate, so the list does not cover the entire field. But putting Clinton’s statement to the Truth-O-Meter only requires us to determine whether any candidate has laid out a "specific plan." The table shows the number of words in each candidate’s ISIS proposal and our count of how many individual agenda items were included in each proposal. Candidate Party Source Words in ISIS proposal Individual agenda items Hillary Clinton Democrat Speech 3,816 24 Jeb Bush Republican Speech 3,195 9 Bernie Sanders Democrat Speech 1,204 7 Marco Rubio Republican Web page 718 18 John Kasich Republican Speech 705 11 Martin O’Malley Democrat Speech 522 6 Ben Carson Republican Web page 429 7 Carly Fiorina Republican Speech 373 5 The table indicates that at least seven other candidates, Republicans and Democrats alike, have offered plans, ranging from five to 18 agenda items in length. (You can scroll through them all here.) Notably, many of the points in Clinton’s plan appear in at least one other candidate’s plan, and often in several other candidates’ plans. They include stronger intelligence, more intensive airstrikes, the use of ground forces, improved cooperation with allies, more effective restrictions on terrorist financing, and better efforts to counter ISIS recruiting on the Internet. For instance, increased intelligence-sharing appears in plans not only from Clinton but also from Sanders, Rubio, Kasich and Fiorina. A greater role for Middle East allies was mentioned not just by Clinton but in one form or another by Bush, Sanders, Rubio, Kasich, O'Malley, Carson and Fiorina. Indeed, of the 24 agenda points we isolated from Clinton’s plan, we found just five that appeared to be only in her plan. They were passage of an updated authorization to use military force; curbing corruption among Middle East governments; securing loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons; improvements in airline-security techniques; and greater effort to ease the humanitarian crisis of refugees from the region. Meanwhile, elements of Rubio’s plans were at least somewhat unique: "engage in global ideological pushback by exposing ISIS’s war crimes and sex trafficking and recruiting disaffected former members to tell their stories," and "counter ISIS recruitment and propaganda by broadcasting U.S. victories, showing the world that ISIS is not invincible." Bush, for his part, was the only candidate to specifically cite Canada’s practice of embedding in Iraqi units as a model, since it is being done "to a very good effect," Bush said. When we contacted Clinton’s campaign for evidence, they pointed to several plaudits in the media for the comprehensiveness of her anti-ISIS plan. For instance, CNN reported that "Michael Desch, an expert in international security at Notre Dame University, said that Clinton's speech was polished and showed her to be ‘head and shoulders’ above Republican candidates on framing an anti-ISIS strategy." And the New York Times’ David Brooks wrote, "While other candidates are content to issue vague calls to get tough on terror, Clinton offered a multilayered but coherent framework, not only dealing with ISIS but also putting that threat within the crosscutting conflicts that are inflaming the Middle East." However, Clinton’s statement in Iowa wasn’t about whether her plan was an effective one; it was that it was the only "specific plan" in the entire field of candidates. And that’s clearly not the case. Our ruling Clinton said, "I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS." While Clinton’s plan is more detailed, by some measurements, than those of other candidates, at least seven other candidates in both parties have released multi-point plans for taking on ISIS. Some plans -- such as those from Bush and Rubio -- approach Clinton’s in either length or degree of detail. In fact, there’s a significant degree of overlap between the agenda items in Clinton’s plan and in plans released by other candidates. We don’t see strong evidence for Clinton’s claim that she’s the only member of the 2016 field with a "specific plan." We rate the claim False.

pomt-01575	Says Democratic Senate candidate "Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/09/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-ad-says-bruce-braley-voted-cut-700-billion-med/	Some political talking points just never die. Like this one, used in a recent ad aired by the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the hotly contested Iowa Senate race between Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst. "Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare," the ad says. "That’s just not fair. We paid in. We paid for it. That should be there for us." Here, we’re going to look at the claim that Braley "voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare." (In a separate item, we’ll look at the second half of the claim.) It’s correct that Braley, as a House member, voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2010. However, PolitiFact has been skeptical of numerous previous claims that Obamacare cuts Medicare, rating them either Half True or Mostly False, depending on how they are worded. Other fact-checkers have concluded similarly. The claim is too sweeping and doesn’t convey fully what the law is doing. Here’s the gist. As Congress was debating President Barack Obama’s health care law in 2010, its backers acted to fend off one line of criticism -- that the bill was a budget-buster -- by making sure the bill didn’t add to the deficit. To do this, they wrote into the law both new taxes and new savings. Among the spending cuts were measures aimed at reducing the increase in future Medicare costs. When the law was passed, the reductions amounted to $500 billion over the following 10 years; eventually, as the 10-year budget window shifted a year or two into the future, the cost of these reductions rose to more than $700 billion. Over 10 years, the combined reductions are estimated to be $415 billion for traditional Medicare, $156 billion for the managed-care option known as Medicare Advantage, $56 billion in payments to teaching hospitals that serve large low-income populations, and $114 billion in other categories, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate. But it’s important to note a few caveats. First, while the ad implies that the law is slicing Medicare benefits, these are not cuts to current services. Rather, as Medicare spending continues to rise over the next 10 years, it will do so at a slower pace would have occurred without the law. So claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. Second, the savings are focused on lowering payments to hospitals and insurance companies. They are not aimed at beneficiaries. For instance, the law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers that serves roughly 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to participating health plans. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Does this mean that no senior citizen today would be harmed by the law’s passage? No. It’s possible that some beneficiaries, including Medicare Advantage participants, could see additional costs passed along to them, experience reductions in services, or find fewer doctors willing to treat them under Medicare. For instance, Brook Hougesen, the NRSC’s press secretary, pointed to news coverage in Iowa about how 9,200 state residents, "many of them in rural areas of the state," had to choose a new Medicare Advantage plan to avoid losing coverage on Jan. 1, 2014. The shifts were prompted by some Medicare Advantage plans’ determination that they could not provide the minimum number of health care providers in thinly populated areas to satisfy Medicare Advantage rules. Still, there’s a lot of uncertainty about the extent and scope of these cutbacks -- more than the ad lets on. Also, the ad ignores some of the benefits seniors will get from the law -- for instance, $48 billion over 10 years for Medicare Part D prescription coverage from the ACA’s provisions that targeted the so-called "donut hole." It also funds illness prevention benefits and expands preventive care benefits. We asked Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid for President George H.W. Bush, whether subsequent changes in the law’s implementation would undercut our previous skepticism about claims like those made against Braley, and she said they did not. The prior critiques of the claim "remain relevant," she said. Our ruling The ad says, "Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare." The law does include cost savings that could impact some beneficiaries, such as Medicare Advantage participants. But the ad overlooks some key nuances. The statement that suggests that the law is reducing benefits now, across the board, but it’s actually reducing the future growth of Medicare spending. The law also targets these reductions at health-care providers, not beneficiaries. And the ad ignores new spending from the law that would benefit Medicare beneficiaries, such as expanded coverage for prescriptions. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate the NRSC’s statement Half True.

pomt-03159	Says Gov. Scott Walker "hasn't done a public event this entire year."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/08/chris-larson/scott-walker-hasnt-done-any-public-events-2013-dem/	Gov. Scott Walker has so cocooned himself from regular folks, state Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson contends, that he "hasn't done a public event in this entire year." Wait, what? Larson made the statement Aug. 27, 2013, on Madison-area radio station WEKZ-FM (93.7), then quickly told liberal talk show host John Sylvester what he meant. "Just to be clear, Sly. His events, they're open to press, donors and for invited guests. I wouldn't consider that a public event," Larson said. "A public event, I would consider something where folks, the working class, can actually make it, where it's not working hours and it's something where it's not invite-only." So, the Milwaukee Democrat has his own idea of what constitutes a public event, although we’re not bound by that definition in rating his claim. Narrow definition When we asked Larson to back his statement, he elaborated by saying that, besides being open without invitation and held outside of regular working hours, a public event should allow ordinary citizens to express opinions to or ask questions of the governor, he said. But that’s not evidence of what Larson said in the interview and it’s an even more narrow definition of public event. By that definition, most meetings of legislative committees -- typically scheduled during business hours -- are not "public events." And it suggests that when the governor visits a factory or business and talks to workers, it shouldn’t count simply because someone off the street couldn’t walk in and participate. So, Larson doesn’t exactly back off his claim. He just aims to shift it to more favorable terms for himself. Larson also pointed to a series of public hearings he held on evenings and weekends on the 2013-’15 state budget, saying Walker has appeared at no such events this year. There's no question that access to the governor -- really, any governor -- is limited. Walker typically gives a day’s notice to news media of what some of his appearances will be the following day. Indeed, he doesn't release detailed daily itineraries until weeks after the fact, a practice followed by Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, for most of his time as governor. Yet, just a few weeks before Larson made his claim, there was Walker addressing folks along with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, to open the Wisconsin State Fair, and attending the Governor’s Red, White and Blue Ribbon Livestock Auction. The fair, obviously, is about an accessible public an event as there is. So, let's take a closer look at where Walker has been. Events in 2013 Walker spokesman Tom Evenson sent us a list of more than 100 Walker events in 2013 that Evenson described as public. Some were easily accessible to the general public; others, because of cost, membership requirements or other reasons, weren't. Here's a sampling: The World Championship Snowmobile Derby in Eagle River, an event that attracted thousands. Television news coverage showed Walker delivering opening remarks and shaking hands with folks wearing snowmobile suits. A Martin Luther King Jr. ceremony in the Capitol rotunda in Madison. Hundreds of people attended the 33rd annual event, including a few who booed during Walker’s remarks, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. The annual State Education Convention at a Milwaukee hotel. Hundreds of school district officials and school board members heard Walker speak, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The three-day Governor’s Conference on Economic Development in Madison. Registration cost a minimum of $250 for Wisconsin Economic Development Association members and up to $340 for non-members. The National Rifle Association state convention in Wausau, where Walker gave a speech. A South Suburban Chamber of Commerce awards dinner in Oak Creek. More than 220 people attended, according to the chamber. The dinner cost $50. Military-related ceremonies in Pewaukee, at Camp Douglas and elsewhere. TV coverage of one event, at the Experimental Aircraft Association in Oshkosh, showed Walker speaking to a large gathering of Army National Guard members and their families. Independence Day parades in Menomonee Falls and Wauwatosa. A number of government meetings in Madison, including Walker presenting his state budget proposal and giving his "state of the state" address. In criticizing Walker’s availability to the general public, a progressive blogger pointed out that an upcoming meeting of the state Building Commission, which the governor is a member of, would be open to the public. An open house held by Pierce Manufacturing near Appleton to mark the firetruck maker’s 100th anniversary. Hundreds heard Walker speak, according to one account. Walker spoke to an audience of predominantly students in a speech at St. Norbert College in De Pere, the student newspaper reported. He also mingled with students and posed for pictures with them, according to images from a local TV station. The governor’s annual prayer breakfast. Tickets were priced at $30 and up. The annual Greater Milwaukee Law Enforcement Memorial Ceremony. Walker was among the speakers at the outdoor event, near the Milwaukee County Courthouse. News conferences, including one at the University of Wisconsin-Superior. TV news coverage showed an opponent of Walker’s state budget plan talking with the governor at the event. So, attendance is limited at some public events Walker attended, but not at others. In any case, Larson’s claim was absolute. Our rating Larson said Walker "hasn't done a public event this entire year." Larson may believe Walker needs to be more open, but it’s ridiculous to say Walker hasn’t done even one public event in 2013. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-15227	"As governor of Florida I defunded Planned Parenthood."	true	/florida/statements/2015/aug/07/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-he-cut-funding-planned-parenthood-go/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush is using the recent release of activist videos criticizing Planned Parenthood as a chance to advertise his own record on restricting abortion. During the first Republican primary presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015, Bush sidestepped a question from Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly about his time on the board of the Bloomberg Family Foundation, which has donated millions to Planned Parenthood. Instead, Bush reiterated he had a long history of opposing abortion. "Here’s my record: As governor of Florida I defunded Planned Parenthood. I created a culture of life in our state," he said. (Watch the exchange in the video here.) Bush earlier this week said the federal government should do the same. We’ve documented Bush’s opposition to abortion before, as well as his preference for abstinence-only education. But we wanted to check if he cut off state assistance for Planned Parenthood while governor, well before the current controversy. It turns out he did, long prior to recent calls to end federal funding for the group. Targeted cuts Planned Parenthood is a network of affiliated nonprofit organizations that cooperate with each other, led by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Funding comes from a wide range of sources, including private donations, grants, health center revenue and Medicaid. In Florida, there are currently two affiliates accredited with the national organization after several mergers, so the group is not organized quite the same as it was in 2001. There are now 23 health centers in the state, 16 of which provide abortion services. (Three of these were recently cited by the state Agency for Health Care Administration for allegedly providing second-trimester abortions without a license, violations Planned Parenthood has denied. A fourth was cited for improper recordkeeping.) Both Bush’s campaign and the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates pointed to the same thing: Two line-item vetoes Bush made to the state budget in 2001. According to a 2001 state fiscal analysis, Bush vetoed $115,759 in funding for Northeast Florida Planned Parenthood in Duval County and $187,084 for Department of Health contracts with Planned Parenthood in Collier and Sarasota counties. As governor, Bush was well-known for his frequent use of his veto power. That money was not for abortions, but was being used to provide family planning services to poor women, and had been available for more than a decade. To give you an idea of the scale of the state assistance, one of the affiliates confirmed in 2001 the payments made up about a quarter of their budget. It used the money to help pay for pap smears and sexually transmitted disease screening and treatment, among other services. The other affiliate noted the money went to treat patients who had no health insurance or access to Medicaid. Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida alliance, confirmed the group did not get any state funding after Bush’s 2001 veto. It still does not receive assistance from the state now. Our ruling Bush said, "As governor of Florida I defunded Planned Parenthood." In 2001, he used his line-item veto power to end funding for Planned Parenthood affiliates, and that funding never returned. We must note that the money was for family planning and health care services, not abortions, but he did cut off state money for the group. We rate the statement True.

pomt-02904	"The Legislature passed Gov. Walker’s so-called property tax relief bill," but the Republicans "are still raising your property taxes."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/06/janet-bewley/despite-100-million-property-tax-relief-wisconsin-/	Soon it will be December and time for presents -- including your annual property tax bill. Oh, the suspense in opening the envelope: Will this year’s bill be lower or higher? But wait. On Oct. 24, 2013, Republican Gov. Scott Walker used his weekly radio address to herald a $100 million property tax relief bill he signed into law four days earlier. Relief means lower taxes, right? After we heard the opening lines of the Democratic response, put out the same day, we weren’t sure what to think. "Last week, the Legislature passed Gov. Walker’s so-called property tax relief bill," Ashland state Rep. Janet Bewley said in her address. "Lost in all the hype is the fact that the governor and Republican-controlled Legislature are still raising your property taxes." So, is the property tax relief real? Is it somehow superseded by property tax increases? And don’t school districts and other local governments help determine how big your property tax bill is? Property tax primer We’ll start by reviewing how a property tax bill comes to be. Every fall, each local unit of government -- cities, villages, towns, counties, school districts, and technical college districts -- adopts a budget for the following year. They subtract what they expect to receive in revenue, such as state aid, license fees, tuition, etc. The remainder has to come from property taxes, which happens to be the largest source of tax revenue in Wisconsin. In total, local governments levy more than 99% of all property taxes; the state claims the last sliver, for forestry programs. Nevertheless, state government plays an important role in how much your property tax bill turns out to be. First of all, the local governments’ levies get reduced by three state tax credits, including the state lottery credit. Second, the state has imposed a variety of caps on how much money local governments can raise or spend. So, even though the locals are the ones levying property taxes, the state puts strict limits on how much they can levy. For example, school districts are limited in the amount of money they can raise in total from property taxes and state aid. On the other hand, school districts can exceed their limits if voters approve a referendum. For municipalities and counties, their levy growth, if any, is limited to the amount of property taxes generated by new construction in their communities. The new law Reining in property taxes has been one of Walker’s priorities as governor. On Oct. 10, 2013, citing growth in state tax revenue, he called a special session of the Legislature to take up property tax relief -- specifically by increasing state aid to school districts. So, the approach was not a simple across-the-board tax reduction. The property tax relief measure was approved overwhelmingly on bipartisan votes -- 82-12 in the Assembly, with Bewley among the Democrats voting for it, and 28-5 in the Senate. The law raises state aid payments to school districts by $40 million (0.92%) in 2013-’14 and $60 million (1.36%) in 2014-’15. But, as we discussed earlier, school districts are under revenue limits. So, while individual levies for school districts will vary, statewide the additional $100 million in state aid to school districts triggers a corresponding $100 million decrease in property taxes. State schools Superintendent Tony Evers pointed out that while the new law "provides property tax relief for some school districts, it does not increase spending for public schools." Now, to Bewley’s claim that Walker and the GOP-run Legislature are "still raising your property taxes." The state budget In her radio remarks, Bewley argued that despite the property tax relief, the average person’s property taxes will rise. When we asked for evidence, her office cited an October 2013 memo from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It takes into account not only the property tax relief, but also the 2013-’15 state budget that Walker signed into law several months earlier. In contrast to the property tax relief bill, the state budget was adopted without a single Democratic vote. It passed 55-42 in the Assembly, with three Republicans voting no; then it passed 17-16 in the Senate, with one Republican voting no. According to the fiscal bureau, the property tax for a median-valued home -- $151,148 -- was $2,943. Under the biennial state budget, the tax was to drop by $5 in the first year, then increase by $36 in the second. That put the tax bill on the typical home at $2,974 -- a net increase of $31 over the two years. But with the property tax relief law, the tax on the typical home is now estimated to go down by $18 in the first year and increase $29 in the second. That would put the tax bill at $2,954 -- a net increase of $11. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson agreed with the figures, but noted that property tax increases have been held down under during Walker's first two years in office. He cited an August 2013 Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance report that said total property taxes, not just the portion levied by school districts, rose by 0.2% in 2011-’12 and 0.8% in 2012-’13. That was the first time since at least 1946 that the total levy rose by less than 1% in two consecutive years, the report said. Our rating Bewley said "the Legislature passed Gov. Walker’s so-called property tax relief bill," but the Republicans "are still raising your property taxes." Bewley’s right that under the Republicans’ 2013-’15 state budget, it’s estimated that property tax bills will rise, by an estimated $11 over two years for a typical home. But the increase would have been larger without the property tax relief, and property tax bills are affected by actions taken by local governments, not just the GOP-controlled state government. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Bewley a Half True. If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-05409	Since 2009, the Ohio Republican Party has made more contacts with voters — nearly 6.6 million — than any other GOP state organization in the nation.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/may/03/kevin-dewine/ex-gop-chair-kevin-dewine-says-his-watch-ohio-part/	Kevin DeWine in April lost a bitter, high-profile power struggle for control of the Ohio Republican Party to Gov. John Kasich even though DeWine was the party’s chairman. The feud between these GOP titans grew so personal that even time may not be enough to heal these battle scars, especially for DeWine. We won’t rehash all the nastiness but in a nutshell Kasich wanted DeWine booted for his perceived lack of support when Kasich successfully ran for office in 2010 against Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. But DeWine did not go quietly, penning a resignation letter in which he declared himself the better man making the sake of the party his foremost concern and noting that Republicans may have just lost the best chairman they had ever had. DeWine, who took office in January 2009, noted that he had promised to re-engage the state party’s conservative base and establish improved voter contact programs. In his letter he deemed himself a success by using the 2010 elections as a barometer when Republicans swept the statewide elected offices and more. He then took his boasting a step further, claiming at least by one measure to be the best run state-level Republican party in the country during his tenure. "Since 2009, the Ohio Republican Party has collected more data points — nearly 6.6 million — than any other state in the nation," DeWine wrote. Data points? PolitiFact Ohio decided to learn more. Party spokesman Chris Maloney later explained that ‘data points’ represent actual contacts with voters, whether it be by phone, door-to-door knocking, email, snail mail or through social media outlets. Maloney would not share the party’s data for proprietary reasons, he said, but insisted the "nearly 6.6 million" figure that DeWine touts is accurate. As for how that ranks against other states, Maloney referred us to the state-level’s parent organization, the Republican National Committee. RNC spokesman Ryan Mahoney sent us a statement: The Ohio GOP’s "strong performance in 2010 combined with their efforts in 2011 give them the most voter contacts/data points since 2009. We monitor and coordinate with all of the states across the country so we can compare how all of the state parties perform." The RNC, however, declined to show us actual state-by-state figures, leaving us to essentially take them at their word. Reviewing the political activity of 2010 and 2011 would lend itself to support DeWine’s assertion. In 2010, all five of Ohio’s statewide elected offices were up for grabs: governor, attorney general, auditor, treasurer and secretary of state. And leading into the election, four of those five offices were held by Democrats. But with the state, much like the rest of the country, reeling from the effects of a recession, Republicans figured to have a strong shot at winning several of those seats and they did — winning all of them. The GOP also held onto a U.S. Senate seat that year. Then came 2011, an off-year for elections that turned out to be anything but. There were two major referendums on the ballot last year that helped mobilize both Republicans and Democrats and drove an unusually high number of voters to the voting booths for a year when no major state or federal political races are anchoring the ballot. Democrats worked their base to come out in overwhelming support of a referendum to overturn Senate Bill 5, a controversial collective bargaining bill. And Republicans reached into their deeply conservative roots to block provisions of the federal healthcare law they dubbed Obamacare from being implemented in Ohio. That turned out to be more a symbolic vote than anything since the U.S. Supreme Court had already decided that it would hear a case to determine if the healthcare law was constitutional. The bottomline is that it figures to reason that Republicans — and Democrats, too, for that matter should they make a similar claim — likely had strong success in reaching out and making contact with their base of voters. So where does that leave us with DeWine’s statement? DeWine’s claim was that since 2009, the Ohio party has collected more contact points than any other state in the nation. He presented that point as part of a greater discussion of his successes as party leader. While the organization is quick to boast about a claim of being the best among 50 state GOP operations, it would not offer up definitive proof to support their point. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee didn’t offer statistics, either, but did support DeWine’s claim that Ohio’s performance for building contacts was tops since 2009. We see no reason for the national organization to label Ohio’s operation as tops compared to the other states unless that is true. Based on that, we find DeWine’s claim is accurate.

pomt-12070	In addition to his compensation as a judge, "Roy Moore and his wife (paid themselves) over $1 million from a charity they ran."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/05/senate-leadership-fund/did-roy-moore-take-1-million-charity-he-ran/	Correction: When we originally reported this fact-check on Sept. 1, we were unable to determine how the Senate Leadership Fund arrived at its figure of "over $1 million," and the group didn’t respond to our query. The evidence seemed to show a total of under $1 million for salary and other benefits. After publication, a spokesman for the group provided additional evidence showing Moore received compensation as a consultant and through an amended filing, bringing the total to more than $1 million. We have corrected our report, and we have changed the rating from Mostly False to Mostly True. An attack ad targeting Roy Moore, a Republican candidate in the Alabama Senate special election, claims that he and his wife Kayla Moore paid themselves $1 million from a nonprofit organization they ran. The ad, funded by the Senate Leadership Fund, also creates the impression Moore drew compensation from the organization, The Foundation for Moral Law, while sitting on the Alabama Supreme Court. "Despite being one of the highest paid judges in the nation (...) Roy Moore wanted more," the advertisement said. "So Roy Moore and his wife (paid themselves) over $1 million from a charity they ran." Moore will face Sen. Luther Strange in a Sept. 26 runoff vote for the Republican nomination to fill the senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. Strange, who’s backed by the Senate Leadership Fund, was tapped to fill Sessions’ seat ahead of the Dec. 12 general election. The Senate Leadership Fund is aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. We decided to investigate the Senate Leadership Fund’s claim that the Moore family drew over $1 million from The Foundation for Moral Law. Did the Moore family draw a $1 million from a non-profit they ran? The stated mission of The Foundation for Moral Law, founded in 2002, is to "educate the public and promote current litigation aimed at moral and religious issues," according to its website. In practice, the group writes friend-of-the-court briefs that advocate a Christian point of view in legal cases involving abortion, gay marriage, public prayer and other litigation with potential to "restore the knowledge of God in law." The group’s ethos aligns with Moore’s controversial judicial career, which includes being forced out as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003 for defying a federal court order to remove the Ten Commandments from the courthouse grounds. Moore was elected again to the Alabama Supreme Court in 2013 and was suspended in 2016 after he directed Alabama’s probate judges to defy federal court orders on same-sex marriage. He resigned the following year. The IRS granted The Foundation for Moral Law tax-exempt status in 2005, and that same year Moore was listed in IRS filings as the foundation’s chairman. Moore served as either chairman or president from 2005 through 2012, and his wife Kayla Moore took over as president in 2013. The attack ad claims it was during this 9-year period — from 2005 through 2013 — that the Moore family drew $1,030,875 in compensation (but as the screengrab shows, this time frame appears inconspicuously and in very fine print, perhaps to create the impression the Moores were paid in a single lump sum, when in fact their compensation was spread over nearly a decade). As the breakdown below shows, the Moore family did in fact receive $1,030,875 from The Foundation for Moral Law over this period, according to IRS filings: Form 990 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 ‘13 Roy Moore 9,983 0 105,500 (Legal consulting) 55,392 72,000 (Amended filing) 90,000 60,000 (Salary) 393,000 (Retirement and other deferred compensation) 138,000 42,000 N/A Kayla Moore N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 65,000 Was Moore paid by the foundation while serving on the Alabama Supreme Court? The ad also creates the impression Moore drew compensation from The Foundation for Moral Law while serving as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, a position he began in 2001. Moore was kicked off the bench in 2003 for refusing to comply with a federal court order to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the rotunda of the state Supreme Court building. He began to draw a salary from the foundation in 2005, two years after his dismissal from the bench, according to the foundation’s IRS filings. So the suggestion he drew the two salaries concurrently is wrong. Our ruling Senate Leadership Fund attack ad said, "Roy Moore and his wife (paid themselves) over $1 million from a charity they ran." From 2005 through 2013, the Moore family drew $1,030,875 from The Foundation for Moral Law. But the ad gave the wrong impression that Moore took a salary from the nonprofit while serving as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-07696	The health care bill has "six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/07/ken-cuccinelli/ken-cuccinelli-says-health-care-law-has-six-years-/	No one has fought President Barack Obama’s health care reform law more effectively than Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. The Republican is spearheading the legal challenges against the bill, especially the "individual mandate" provision that would require most Americans to buy health insurance. Cuccinelli won a major victory in December 2010 when a federal judge found that provision of the law to be unconstitutional, and the case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court. During a March 1 appearance on Fox News, Cuccinelli was asked about Obama’s recent statement that he would support legislation that would allow states opt out of the mandate if they can find another way to expand coverage without driving up health care costs. Cuccinelli said he doesn’t expect much to come from the president’s comments. "They put four enormous conditions on what they call the opting out or providing some flexibility, and one of them that I would point to first is that it has to be deficit-neutral, which for a president who's counting six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue to call his [proposal] balanced, you think he's going to let the states do that?" Cuccinelli asked. "I doubt it." The claim that the health care bill charges 10 years of taxes and for only six years of services is widely used by Republicans. We have checked it before, as has PolitiFact’s national staff. Brian Gottstein, director of communications for Cuccinelli, said the attorney general "was referring to how the taxes begin four years before the services do." Two of the highest-profile elements of the bill start in 2014, roughly four years after the law took effect. The virtual marketplaces known as health care exchanges would start that year, enabling those who are uninsured or who do not have access to coverage through an employer to buy insurance. Also starting that year would be subsidies to help people buy coverage on the exchange. In addition, that's the year for a major expansion in eligibility for Medicaid. And a 10-year phase out of the "doughnut hole" -- the gap in Medicare drug coverage -- began last year. The Republican argument that benefits don’t kick in until 2014 is true if you’re looking at those big provisions. But many smaller provisions have already taken effect. As PolitiFact has previously reported, there are plenty of examples: • Small business tax credits. From 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost. • Coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Soon after enactment, people with pre-existing conditions who haven't had coverage for at least six months could obtain coverage through a "high-risk pool" with subsidized premiums. This would be a temporary solution until the exchanges begin in 2014. • Assistance for early retirees. Starting last year, a temporary reinsurance program will help cut the cost of health coverage for retirees not old enough to be eligible for Medicare. • Dependent coverage to age 26. Shortly after enactment, all insurers were forced to offer dependent coverage for children up to age 26. • No more recisions. Existing plans can no longer terminate beneficiaries when they get sick. • Enhanced preventive care. Soon after enactment, qualified health plans were forced to provide certain preventive services without cost-sharing. Starting this year, patient cost-sharing for preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid are eliminated. The other half of this claim is that taxes kicked in immediately. Some of the tax provisions that help pay for the plan are already in effect. A 10 percent levy on indoor tanning began last year, and an escalating annual fee on drugmakers begins this year. Individuals with flexible spending plans and health savings accounts -- tax-advantaged accounts linked to health care expenses -- have already been hit with certain exclusions and limits. But many of the major tax changes will be delayed by a few years. • Medical device taxes. A new levy on medical device makers worth about $20 billion over 10 years kicks in 2013. • Taxes to benefit Medicare Part A. The bill's hike of payroll taxes for individuals earning $200,000 or couples earning $250,000 and a new tax on unearned income for higher earners will start in 2013. • Insurance sector fees. Fees on health insurers totaling $67 billion over 10 years become effective in 2014. • Mandated coverage. Two of the bill's provisions most controversial to Republicans -- the requirement that individuals buy health insurance and that employers of a certain size offer affordable health insurance, under penalty of a fine -- would not begin until 2014. The individual mandate would start low that year and then phase in through 2016. • "Cadillac tax." The most recent version of the bill pushes back the tax on higher-cost health plans until 2018. Now, let’s look at numbers to get a sense of proportion. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress' bipartisan judge of revenue impacts from proposed laws -- the tax provisions collect minimal revenue for 2010, $2.9 billion for 2011 and $5.5 billion for 2012. They start getting enormous 2013, when revenues increase to $31.9 billion, eventually peaking at $86.9 billion in 2019. Indeed, of the total $409.2 billion in increased taxes over the 10-year window, only 10 percent of that amount is raised in the first four years -- the period when, according to Cuccinelli and other Republicans, the government is collecting taxes without providing care. Meanwhile, on the benefits side, it's true that the cost increases significantly four years after enactment. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's Office of the Actuary, the first four years account for about 1 percent of the 10-year cost of increased coverage. The "statement that you have 10 years of taxes and six years of benefits is obviously an oversimplification," said Paul N. Van de Water, Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "But overall, it is generally true that more taxes kick in a little bit earlier than the benefits do." Van de Water said the larger question is whether this is a gimmick and a long-term problem. The answer to that, he said, is no. "Despite the fact that it’s true that some of the taxes kick in on average a bit earlier, by the end of the 10-year period the health reform bill still produces a modest reduction of the deficit, according to the CBO estimate," he said, "and in the subsequent 10-year period the reduction of the deficit gets even larger." Let’s review. Cuccinelli says the health care reform law charges 10 years of taxes for six years of benefits. It suggests we're paying all of the taxes now and getting none of the benefits. Cuccinelli and other Republicans are correct that the bill's biggest expansions in coverage do not happen until 2014, including the exchanges, the subsidies and the Medicaid expansion. He's also right that some taxation has already begun, albeit it minor. The bill is is a bit front-loaded. About 10 percent of the taxes for health care reform will be levied in the first four years to pay for an estimated 1 percent of cost. But Cuccinelli is flat wrong to say health care reform offers no benefits before 2014. Some of the bill’s most popular provisions -- including no cancelation of health insurance for pre-existing conditions, guaranteed coverage of dependents to age 26, and tax credits for small businesses -- have taken effect and other components will be implemented before 2014. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Ken Cuccinelli	None	None	None	2011-03-07T15:37:01	2011-03-01	['None']
pomt-01979	More than 1.5 million people moved into Georgia between the past two Census counts, and a majority consider themselves, African-American, Latino or Asian-American.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/17/stacey-abrams/most-georgias-population-growth-minorities/	Georgia’s changing demographics has become fodder in political circles about what those numbers could mean come November. The talk focuses broadly on the population growth in the state and just who has been moving in. The Democrats’ idea: follow the Obama administration’s successful playbook and win over those folks with voter registration and turnout efforts to capture their party’s bid for U.S. Senate and governor. We decided to check claims by House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, an Atlanta Democrat who also heads a nonprofit focusing on voter registration, on the numbers involved. "In Georgia, during the previous decade between Census counts, more than 1.5 million new neighbors set up homes in the state," Abrams wrote in the Huffington Post. The majority of those arrivals were minorities, she said. In Georgia, race is often a good predictor of political affiliation. Racial minorities in the state tend to vote Democratic, according to experts. With polls showing both the Senate and governor’s race as competitive, those numbers could matter, so we decided to take a look at how they stack up. Abrams told us she got the numbers from the U.S. Census, the actual count of people living in the United States that the government takes every 10 years. The primary focus of that numerical snapshot is to decide the number of seats each state will get in the U.S. House of Representatives. For that reason, the total count is quite reliable. In 2000, Georgia had 8,186,453 people. A decade later, the count was 9,687,653. That’s almost exactly the 1.5 million Abrams cites to HuffPost. More complicated is the question of minorities. The Census form specifically states that Hispanic origin is not race. For that reason, most recent Census form asked two questions about race – identifiers such as white or black – and ethnicity, which includes the question about Latino or Hispanic origin. Yet a growing share of Americans don’t pick a race category on the form, according to Census news releases. That results in figures that aren’t quite as refined, especially over time when the questions regarding race and ethnicity have changed somewhat. Robert Bernstein, a Census spokesman in Washington, D.C., walked us through the numbers as the agency sees it. Tucked into one table in both Census sets were population counts by race, and a separate breakout of those not considered Hispanic or Latino. "That is effectively the minority population," Bernstein said. For Georgia, there were 3,057,772 non-white people in the state in 2000. By 2010, that number increased to 4,273,733. That means 1.2 million of the 1.5 million new people in Georgia between Census counts were non-white – or 81 percent. Abrams said her focus was meant to be the substantial numbers involved in the population and how that matches up with voter registration. "The conversation is about engagement," Abrams aid. "There is an important philosophy of having all citizens engaged in the process." Citizen is the key word. The Census counts all people – regardless of age, legal status or citizenship – living in the state. Voting, of course, is open only to citizens who are at least 18 years old. That explains, in part, the other demographic reality: the majority of Georgia’s active voters, generally defined as someone who has voted in the past three years, are white. Data from the Secretary of State’s office shows that, in May 2002, 72 percent of the state’s active voters were white. That number plunged to about 59 percent as of November, data shows. But the 2013 figures also show more than 323,000 new white voters. That means the percentage of non-Hispanic whites is smaller than it had been, but even there, Georgia is seeing more voters, said Alan I. Abramowitz, an expert on American political demographics at Emory University. "There is a lag between the changing demographic of the population and the changing of your electorate," Abramowitz said. "Both are definitely changing, that is true, but not at the same rate." To wrap it up, Stacey Abrams hit the mark with her numbers. The significance of those changes, though, don’t immediately translate into similar shifts in the makeup of the state’s voters. If the point is to identify and register more would-be voters, more refined numbers about citizenship and age would be needed. For that reason, we rate Abrams’ statement as Mostly True.

pomt-03307	Says HJM 20 "was the only bill not assigned to a House committee."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/jul/29/oregon-catalyst/was-bill-condeming-irs-scandal-only-one-not-referr/	Remember that IRS scandal a few months back? An investigation found that the Internal Revenue Service had been closely scrutinizing the tax status of several conservative groups. Naturally, Republicans were not happy with this news. Some tried to tie the scandal directly to the Obama Administration, though no such link has been found. The issue has mostly faded from the headlines, but it still continues to bubble up from time to time. It did so recently in a piece on the conservative blog Oregon Catalyst. The article, which has no listed author, notes that "people all over Oregon and the United States have been deeply troubled by the growing scandal involving the Obama administration’s use of the Internal Revenue Service for political purposes. The notion that the IRS would be used to harass and intimidate conservative grassroots organizations is one that many find very offensive." Now, whether the Obama administration specifically used the IRS for anything is still open to debate. More recently it has come out that groups with words like "progressive" in their names were also scrutinized. However, we’re not fact checking that this time around. What we’re looking at is something else altogether. During the 2013 legislative session, Oregon Republicans introduced a House Joint Memorial that asked Congress to "take all appropriate action, including but not limited to further investigation of Internal Revenue Service actions and the drafting of any appropriate legislation, to rein in the powers of, and increase congressional oversight over" the IRS. But HJM 20 -- which we’ll note is a non-binding, symbolic piece of legislation -- didn’t go anywhere. Oregon Catalyst was not happy about that: "Unfortunately, HJM 20 was referred to the Speaker’s desk and stayed there until the session ended. It was never even assigned to a committee for consideration. In fact, it was the ONLY (emphasis theirs) bill not assigned to a House committee. "Maybe (Speaker of the House) Tina Kotek should stop covering for the Obama administration’s rampant abuses of power and stand up for our constitutional rights. And House Republicans should absolutely re-introduce a similar piece of legislation in next February’s month-long session." At PolitiFact Oregon, we love words like "only" "most" "first" -- superlatives in general. They’re typically easy to check. So leaving aside the motives of Kotek, a Democrat, we wondered if this really was the only bill not assigned to a House committee. The statement was easy enough to check. We went to the Oregon Legislature’s website and looked at a list of all the measures and bills and resolutions in the House and their histories. As it happens HJM 20 did have some company. Both House Bills 2010 and 2011 also died on the speaker’s desk. Both pieces of legislation were proposed by Republicans. House Bill 2010 concerned the Water Resources Department and House Bill 2011 addressed having public employees return wages from an administrative leave if the leave is determined to be the result of criminal conduct. We’re always curious at PolitiFact Oregon and flipped back a couple sessions to see if this has happened before. It turns out it’s exceedingly rare. In fact we could find no other such instance. One other fact worth noting: HJM 20 had its first reading to the full House on July 1, well after deadlines had passed to get legislation through a complicated committee and two-chamber process. In fact, at that point, most of the committees had likely stopped meeting altogether. Certainly it could have been given priority, but given that the Legislature adjourned a week later, it would have been a stretch. The other two bills mentioned above similarly did not get their first reading until July 1 or later. We asked Dan Lucas, the man behind Oregon Catalyst, to weigh in but he declined to comment. In an online post, Oregon Catalyst lambasted Kotek for not advancing HJM 20, saying it was the only bill not assigned to a committee. In fact, it was one of the three; rare but not unique. We rate this claim False.	None	Oregon Catalyst	None	None	None	2013-07-29T16:53:28	2013-07-17	['None']
pomt-07109	"Who are the most consistently misinformed media viewers? … Fox viewers, consistently, every poll."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/20/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-says-those-who-watch-fox-news-are-most/	EDITOR'S NOTE: On the June 21, 2011, edition of The Daily Show, Jon Stewart accepted our False verdict and apologized, saying, "I defer to (PolitiFact's) judgment and apologize for my mistake. To not do so would be irresponsible." On the June 19, 2011, edition of Fox News Sunday, comedian Jon Stewart -- host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central -- sat down for an interview with Chris Wallace. Many readers asked us to review one of his claims. "Who are the most consistently misinformed media viewers?" Stewart asked Wallace. "The most consistently misinformed? Fox, Fox viewers, consistently, every poll." Wallace didn’t challenge Stewart’s assertion that Fox -- widely perceived as a conservative-leaning network -- produced more misinformed viewers. But we thought it was an assessment worth checking. We found two polling organizations that have produced periodic "knowledge" surveys differentiated by the respondent’s frequent news sources. One is the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, and the other is worldpublicopinion.org, a project managed by the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland. Let’s start with Pew’s findings. Pew periodically studies media usage and public knowledge. They ask whether a respondent is a "regular" reader, viewer or listener of major print, television, radio and Internet news sources, and they ask a series of basic factual questions about news and public affairs to gauge how well-informed the respondent is. After conferring with Pew researchers, we found three surveys since 2007 that shed some light on how informed Fox viewers are compared to consumers of other media. Here they are: • February 2007 Political Knowledge Survey. Pew asked respondents 23 questions, such as who the vice president is, who the president of Russia is, whether the Chief Justice is conservative, which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives and whether the U.S. has a trade deficit. The ability to answer 15 of these questions correctly earned the respondent a place in the "high knowledge" category. Pew then categorized various media sources by the percentage of their followers who earned a high knowledge rating. The media outlets fell into three categories -- those that had 50 to 54 percent in the high knowledge group, those that had 40 to 49 percent in the high knowledge group, and those that had 34 to 39 percent in the high knowledge group. In descending order, the 50-to-54 percent group included The Daily Show and its Comedy Central cousin, The Colbert Report; major newspaper websites; the PBS News Hour with Jim Lehrer; Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor; National Public Radio; and Rush Limbaugh’s syndicated radio talk show. The 40-to-49 percent category included national newsmagazines; television news websites; local daily newspapers; Internet news sources like Yahoo and Google; and CNN. Finally, the 34-to-39 percent group included the network evening news shows; online news discussion blogs; Fox News Channel; local television news; and the network morning shows. Now, let’s analyze the data. Fox isn’t last on the list, although it’s close -- 35 percent of Fox viewers earned a high knowledge rating, which was tied with local television news and was one point ahead of the network morning shows. However, Fox’s 35 percent score places it exactly at the national average. This seems paradoxical -- Fox ranks near the bottom of a long list of media outlets, yet it sits right at the national average. But there’s an explanation. Lots of respondents reported following none of the media outlets they were asked about, and those respondents did quite poorly on the knowledge quiz -- not surprisingly. That meant that the non-media-using respondents brought down the national average, but they didn’t constitute a separate category that ranked lower than Fox on Pew’s chart. Since Stewart was referring to "media viewers," this doesn’t undercut his point. However, the data includes an important counterpoint to Stewart’s claim: Viewers of at least one show on Fox scored quite well -- The O’Reilly Factor, of whom 51 percent made it into the high knowledge group. That made it equal to National Public Radio -- a longtime target of conservative complaints about liberal media bias -- and only three percentage points behind Stewart’s own show, at 54 percent. • April 2008 Media Survey. Compared to the 2007 survey, the 2008 survey looked at a wider variety of media outlets but used a narrower selection of questions designed to test the respondent’s current-affairs knowledge. The pollsters asked three questions: "Do you happen to know which political party has a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives?" "Can you tell me the name of the current U.S. Secretary of State?" And "who is the current prime minister of Great Britain?" Anyone who went three-for-three earned the high knowledge designation. Here, the range of results was much wider. Once again, Fox News was just about at the national average -- 19 percent of Fox viewers scored in the high knowledge category, compared to 18 percent of all respondents -- but this time a handful of news outlets scored lower than Fox did. With scores ranging from 17 percent all the way down to 9 percent, they were CNBC, local television news, network news, morning news shows, television newsmagazines, personality magazines, religious radio, the Weather Channel, CBS News, Access Hollywood and similar shows, and in last place, the National Enquirer. And once again, particular Fox shows scored well above the average. Hannity & Colmes was one of only four choices to exceed 40 percent -- the others were the New Yorker/the Atlantic, NPR and MSNBC’s Hardball -- while The O’Reilly Factor scored 28 percent, or 10 points above the national average. (Hannity & Colmes even exceeded Stewart’s Daily Show in this poll, 42 percent to 30 percent.) In all, this poll undercuts Stewart’s position even more than the 2007 poll did. • June 2010 Media Consumption Survey. For 2010, respondents were asked four questions -- which party controlled the House of Representatives, what post was held by Eric Holder, which company was run by Steve Jobs and which country has an active volcano that had recently disrupted international air travel. This time, Pew didn’t specifically use a "high knowledge" measurement but rather broke down responses by how many were answered correctly by each media outlet’s followers. Once again, Fox News as a whole ranked fairly low among regularly used media outlets -- 20 percent answered all four correctly and 18 percent answered three correctly. Still, those numbers beat the national average of 14 percent and 20 percent, respectively. (The best-scoring outlet, the Wall Street Journal, posted scores of 51 percent and 23 percent, respectively.) Fox actually scored better than its two direct cable-news rivals -- MSNBC, which is a liberal counterpoint to Fox, and CNN, which is considered more middle-of-the-road. Also scoring lower than Fox were local television news, the evening network news shows and the network morning shows. And for the third time, particular Fox shows scored well. Hannity ranked fifth (just ahead of MSNBC’s liberal shows hosted by Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow) and O’Reilly ranked ninth. For the first time, Pew included Glenn Beck in its rankings, and the Fox host finished 12th -- slightly ahead of Stewart’s own Daily Show. We asked Michael Dimock, Pew’s associate director for research, what he thought Pew’s data meant for Stewart’s claim. He said it’s crucial to understand that different news sources appeal to different types of people -- and that highly political programming of any type attracts regular readers and viewers "who are, most likely, already highly knowledgeable prior to their exposure to those particular sources. Separating what knowledge they bring with them from what they learn while reading or watching is virtually impossible." By contrast, Dimock said, for media outlets with a much broader reach -- including Fox -- "the average regular consumer of these sources is less informed than the more niche audiences, because these sources, by design, reach and appeal to a broader cross-section of the public. In most of our studies, the regular readers and viewers of these broad-based news sources are not significantly more or less informed than the average American, and there is no systematic pattern showing one broad-based source has a more knowledgeable audience than any other." Pew’s methodology is not immune from critique. Most notably, it’s not clear whether knowing the answer to a few current-affairs questions translates into being "informed." However, the experts we spoke to said that Pew is an unbiased source and that its data is credible. Given that, we conclude that the Pew data demonstrates that the reality of who’s "misinformed" is a lot more nuanced than Stewart makes it out to be. Now let’s turn to the studies by worldpublicopinion.org. We found two studies by the group that tracked current-affairs knowledge. • "Misperceptions, The Media and The Iraq War" study, 2003. This study focused on the Iraq War and the lead-up to it. It asked three questions: "Is it your impression that the U.S. has or has not found clear evidence in Iraq that Saddam Hussein was working closely with the al-Qaida terrorist organization?" "Since the war with Iraq ended, is it your impression that the US has or has not found Iraqi weapons of mass destruction?" And whether, "The majority of people favor the US having gone to war." On these questions, Fox clearly did the worst among the major news outlets. The "misperception rate" for Fox was 45 percent. The highest for other news outlets was CBS News at 36 percent; those with lower "misperception rates" included CNN, ABC, NBC, the print media and NPR/PBS, which was lowest at 11 percent. This study is probably the strongest support we found for Stewart’s claim, in part because the difference between Fox and the other news outlets was so stark, and in part because the questions asked have pretty clear-cut "right" and "wrong" answers. • Misinformation and the 2010 Election, 2010. This study inspired some of the most intense response of any we looked at. For instance, the liberal blog Daily Kos trumpeted the study with the headline, "CONFIRMED: New Study Proves That Fox News Makes You Stupid." But it’s also the study that prompted the fiercest counterattack on methodological grounds. The study asked 10 questions. Some are fairly cut and dried -- which president signed the TARP law to bail out Wall Street (Bush), which implemented the automaker bailout (both Bush and Obama), whether the stimulus bill included tax cuts (it did),and whether Barack Obama was born in the United States (he was). But a few were in a bit grayer area, often asking respondents to gauge what experts have concluded about policy trends. One was, "Is it your impression that most economists who have studied it estimate that the stimulus has created (a) saved or created several million jobs, (b) saved or created a few jobs, or (c) caused job losses." Another was, "Is it your impression that economists who have estimated the effect of the health reform law on the federal budget deficit over the next 10 years, (a) more think it will not increase the deficit, (b) views are evenly divided, or (c) more think it will increase the deficit." The Baltimore Sun’s television critic, David Zurawik, wrote a column shortly after the study appeared, expressing skepticism about the study. Zurawik wrote, "what you have for the definition of a respondent who is considered ‘informed’ is essentially someone who agrees with the conclusions of experts in government agencies. When specific questions in the survey are framed around facts, like who was president when a certain piece of legislation passed, you can say someone is misinformed." But that’s not the case with some of this survey’s questions. One question from the study that struck us as one that ordinary Americans might answer differently than economists asked, "Do you think now that the American economy is (a) starting to recover, or (b) still getting worse?" The study based the "correct" answer -- that the economy has begun to recover -- on the widely accepted judgment of when the last recession ended, as well as gross domestic product estimates and statistics for personal income. However, given the phrasing of the question, a respondent might think the question was asking for a personal opinion of how the recovery was going, rather than what the official statistics say. In a note, the study’s authors acknowledged such concerns, but defended their approach. "When dealing with topics that have been highly politicized, it is common to default to the position that all perceptions are relative and treatment of any position as more or less true is itself inherently political," the study says. "We believe that such a position is at odds with what is necessary for well-functioning democracy." We should note that like this study, PolitiFact often uses the Congressional Budget Office and the Medicare trustees as credible sources, and we often query experts to come up with our rulings. We think there’s a difference between bestowing a False rating on an elected official -- whose job it is to know about public policy -- and calling an ordinary American "misinformed" for getting the exact same question "wrong." At the very least, these questions seem less clear-cut than asking who the vice president is. For this reason, we believe that this study should carry less weight in analyzing Stewart’s comment. So we have three Pew studies that superficially rank Fox viewers low on the well-informed list, but in several of the surveys, Fox isn’t the lowest, and other general-interest media outlets -- such as network news shows, network morning shows and even the other cable news networks -- often score similarly low. Meanwhile, particular Fox shows -- such as The O’Reilly Factor and Sean Hannity’s show -- actually score consistently well, occasionally even outpacing Stewart’s own audience. Meanwhile, the other set of knowledge surveys, from worldpublicopinion.org, offer mixed support for Stewart. The 2003 survey strikes us as pretty solid, but the 2010 survey has been critiqued for its methodology. The way Stewart phrased the comment, it’s not enough to show a sliver of evidence that Fox News’ audience is ill-informed. The evidence needs to support the view that the data shows they are "consistently" misinformed -- a term he used not once but three times. It’s simply not true that "every poll" shows that result. So we rate his claim False.	None	Jon Stewart	None	None	None	2011-06-20T18:23:40	2011-06-19	['None']
pomt-03687	The Miami Dolphins "are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes."	false	/florida/statements/2013/apr/22/carlos-gimenez/carlos-gimenez-says-miami-dolphins-are-only-proper/	The Miami Dolphins are attempting to score what would be an incredibly fast political touchdown: a one-month campaign to convince Miami-Dade County voters to sign off on a stadium construction deal. After nearly around the clock negotiations at the stadium and county hall, fueled by frequent runs for Cuban cafecito, County Mayor Carlos Gimenez hammered out a deal with the Dolphins. During the county meeting on April 10, 2013, when commissioners signed off on the referendum, Commissioner Sally Heyman asked if the stadium would continue to pay property taxes. During the negotiations, the Dolphins proposed turning over the stadium ownership to the county. The team had also appealed their property taxes two years in a row but then dropped the appeals. Gimenez replied: "Commissioner, as far as I know the Miami Dolphins are the only professional team in the state of Florida that actually pays property taxes. And, as far as I know, the Dolphins are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes. This does not change." At PolitiFact Florida, our ears perk up when we hear that something is the "only" one in the country. Are the Miami Dolphins the only NFL team to pay property taxes? For the $350 million stadium deal to go forward, the tax-weary Legislature must sign off on some of the financing before the session ends May 3, and then Miami-Dade voters must approve it in a May 14 referendum. By May 22, the NFL will decide whether to award the 50th Super Bowl in 2016 to Miami or San Francisco. Focusing on property taxes is just one piece of the finances of a stadium. Nearly all NFL stadiums have received public financing of some sort. "No property taxes on stadiums is a part of the negotiation between the team and the relevant government entities – the trade-off very likely is a bigger subsidy coupled with property taxes, or smaller subsidies and property tax exemptions," Robert Baade, a business of sports professor at Lake Forest, told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Dolphins property taxes In making his statement, Gimenez was repeating something he heard from Dolphins owner Stephen Ross during negotiation meetings, County spokeswoman Suzy Trutie told PolitiFact Florida. "We’re the only team in the country that doesn’t have any public dollars with our stadium. We pay full real estate taxes. We’re the only team in Florida and the only team in the NFL that pays full real estate taxes," Ross was quoted in the Miami Herald in March. "We’re not looking to be relieved of that ... ." Dolphins spokesman Eric Jotkoff said Ross’ statement refers to the land and the stadium, although the land is owned by the county. Trutie said that the $3 million in real estate taxes is for "the building and the land, even though the county owns the land." The Dolphins tax bill for the stadium itself was about $3.6 million in 2012 -- that includes about $3 million in real estate taxes and the rest was for tangible personal property and local business taxes, Miami-Dade tax records show. The tax bill for the parking lots is about $368,000. Washington Redskins and Carolina Panthers pay stadium property taxes We contacted multiple NFL teams and found two in addition to the Dolphins that pay property taxes on their stadiums: the Washington Redskins and the Carolina Panthers. Spokespersons for the teams as well as local government officials confirmed for PolitiFact that the teams pay property taxes on the stadiums. The Redskins own FedEx Field in Landover, Md. The Redskins paid about $3 million for in 2013 -- most of that is for property taxes and includes a small fee for solid waste collection, according to Prince George’s County. The amount of business personal property taxes for a related stadium entity was $406,230.24. The Carolina Panthers paid about $1.7 million in property taxes on the Bank of America stadium in Charlotte for 2011, the year of the most recent valuation, according to Eric Anderson, deputy director in the Mecklenburg County assessor’s office. The Panthers lease the city-owned land for $1 a year. The team paid a tax on the lease, which was about $346,246 for 2011. The team also paid business personal property tax of about $313,800. The Panthers have had some battles in the past with Mecklenburg County about the taxes. During a revaluation of the property in 2003, the county raised the value. "The county gave you a huge break on this, if you want to know the truth," Ham Wade, the county's attorney, told the team's appraiser at one point during that battle. Payments in lieu of taxes In some cases, stadiums don’t pay property taxes but they do make a payment in lieu of taxes -- and that payment can be substantial. Take for example the town of Foxborough, population 17,000, that gets about $2 million for payment in lieu of taxes from the New England Patriots. That payment is about 40 to 60 percent less than the amount would be if the team paid property taxes, estimated the town’s finance director Randy Scollins. The payment plan is controversial, but Scollins told PolitiFact "I see the wisdom in it. The theory is that wouldn’t we be so lucky as to have an economic engine in your back yard." The New York Giants and the New York Jets don’t pay property taxes on their shared MetLife stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (However, the borough is in negotiations and in court about whether the Giants should pay $1.5 million in property taxes on a training facility within the same sports complex as the stadium.) The city receives a payment in lieu of property taxes -- about $7.2 million through the New Jersey Sports & Exposition Authority. A portion of that comes from the stadium, East Rutherford mayor James Cassella told PolitiFact. "Technically they don’t pay property taxes, but they do pay money to the municipality," he said. Our ruling Gimenez said during a county meeting that the Miami Dolphins "are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes." That’s not accurate: two additional NFL teams pay property taxes on their stadiums. For the most recent year available, the Carolina Panthers paid about $1.7 million while the Washington Redskins paid about $3 million. Some teams pay some sort of other payment in lieu of property taxes. Technically, those aren’t property taxes, but in the case of the New England Patriots, the $2 million payment to the town of Foxborough isn’t too shabby. Gimenez exaggerated when he said that the Dolphins are the only NFL team in the country that pays property taxes. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08824	"We are amassing most of our military strength in a country where fewer than 100 members of al Qaeda remain."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/13/elizabeth-dennigan/dennigan-says-US-is-amassing-its-military/	As Washington debates the effectiveness of President Obama's counterinsurgency plan in Afghanistan, one congressional hopeful here has blasted the strategy. Elizabeth "Betsy" Dennigan, one of several candidates challenging U.S. Rep. James Langevin for his District 2 seat, criticizes the move to add troops in Afghanistan and questions Langevin's judgment in recently voting in favor of $33 billion in supplemental funding. Her take: "Our massive, expensive presence in Afghanistan undermines our efforts to eliminate safe havens for al Qaeda in Pakistan and to fight these determined terrorists globally." That's her opinion and she's entitled to that. But then she cited a fact that got our attention: "We are amassing most of our military strength in a country where fewer than 100 members of al Qaeda remain," she wrote. The latest numbers from the Department of Defense indicate there are about 100,000 troops deployed to Afghanistan, up from about 87,000 earlier this year. As of last week, there were 62,000 troops in Iraq, down sharply from recent months. But that's just the tally of those serving in the two major offensives. In total, the Pentagon reports that there are approximately 1.4 million active-duty U.S. military personnel. The 100,000 troops serving in Afghanistan represent less than 10 percent of total military forces -- hardly "most of our military strength." But as of March when the most recent calculation was done, the total U.S. deployment overseas numbered roughly 300,000. Given the changes in troop levels, that number is now closer to 200,000, including those in combat and non-combat situations. A very rough calculation would therefore suggest that the troops deployed to Afghanistan do account for around half of those. So Dennigan is slightly off the mark when she uses the phrase "most." The more interesting statistic in her statement is that there are fewer than 100 members of al Qaeda left in Afghanistan. The question of al Qaeda's strength has been debated for years in political circles, until earlier this summer when CIA Director Leon Panetta, in an appearance on ABC's "This Week," settled some of the mystery by offering his best estimate of al Qaeda's presence. The number, he said, is "relatively small." "At most, we're looking at maybe 50 to 100, maybe less," Panetta said. "It's in that vicinity. There's no question that the main location of al Qaeda is in tribal areas of Pakistan." The CIA director's assessment was so unusual that it quickly made the rounds on the Internet, generating millions of hits and political buzz aplenty. That's how the Dennigan campaign said they found the statistic, and why they felt comfortable repeating it. "He's the CIA director. He's the guy who would have the most information," said Dennigan spokesman Tim McLaughlin. Is there a way to know for sure whether Panetta's numbers are correct? No. At least not without a higher security clearance than we'll ever get. But for now it is the most up to date and official pronouncement we can locate. So unless and until we find a more accurate figure, we’ll rely on Panetta’s estimate and assume that Dennigan is right on that point. We rate this as Mostly True.

pomt-12074	Says Manny Pacquiao, Usain Bolt and Princes William and Harry have donated tens of millions of dollars to Hurricane Harvey victims.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/01/blog-posting/celebrity-donations-tens-millions-dollars-harvey-v/	Three similarly worded posts published on News360-tv.com said Manny Pacquiao, Usain Bolt and Princes William and Harry had each donated tens of millions of dollars to Hurricane Harvey victims. They haven’t. Pacquiao, a Filipino boxer and politician, was said to have spent $50 million to rebuild Houston. Princes Harry and William were said to have given $100 million to assist and house victims of the flood. And Bolt, an Olympic sprinter, was said to have spent a whopping $150 million on hurricane relief. While other celebrities are indeed pledging thousands to the cause, these magnanimous donations haven’t been reported on any credible news sites, and the celebrities have not made any such announcements on social media. The stories about Bolt and Pacquiao used almost the exact same wording as a story we’ve already debunked claiming boxer Floyd Mayweather donated $200 million for hurricane relief. They each started with the quip "To whom much is given, much is expected." They also falsely claimed the athletes had traveled to Houston and attributed the same quotes to each. "It is a humanitarian gesture, an act of solidarity and support for a brotherly affected people," the stories attributed to Bolt, Pacquiao and Mayweather all say. Unlike some other fake news sites, this one doesn’t have a disclaimer about the veracity of quotes or news reports, but it has all the tell-tale signs of a fake news peddler, like unattributed facts, no publication date and click-bait ads.

pomt-14882	"Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/ben-carson/ben-carson-said-raising-minimum-wage-will-increase/	At the Fox Business Network debate, it didn’t take long for the topic of the minimum wage to come up. During a back-and-forth with the moderators, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson urged caution on raising the minimum wage, saying, "People need to be educated on the minimum wage. Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases." We checked a similar claim by Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md. In November 2014, Cardin made the opposite case, claiming that "every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs." We rated Cardin’s claim Mostly False, after determining that during the 12 months following each of the 11 minimum wage increases since 1978, about half produced a net gain in jobs and about half produced a net loss of jobs. In this case, we decided we couldn’t rely on the exact same data, since Cardin referred to a growth in jobs, while Carson referred to an increase in joblessness. Those aren’t exactly the same things, though the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates both metrics. So we used the same methodology to look at the 12-month changes in unemployment level after those 11 minimum-wage hikes. The chart below shows what we found: Year of minimum wage increase New minimum wage Change in number of people unemployed over next 12 months Was a recession going on during the 12-month period? 1978 $2.65 Down 380,000 No 1979 $2.90 Up 574,000 Yes 1980 $3.10 Up 1,388,000 Yes 1981 $3.35 Up 1,326,000 Yes 1990 $3.80 Up 1,642,000 Yes 1991 $4.25 Up 976,000 No 1996 $4.75 Down 577,000 No 1997 $5.15 Down 356,000 No 2007 $5.85 Up 1,788,000 Yes 2008 $6.55 Up 5,664,000 Yes 2009 $7.25 Down 89,000 No The headline here is that joblessness rose after a minimum-wage hike more than half the time -- seven out of 11 occasions -- but fell four times. Since joblessness fell some of the time, it means that Carson’s sweeping claim -- that joblessness rises "every time" the minimum wage goes up is off-base. But there’s another factor that casts additional doubt on his assertion. As it happened, there was a recession under way during six of the 11 periods we studied. During each of those periods, joblessness rose after the minimum wage went up. This is not surprising -- but it does cast into doubt the cause and effect behind the rise in joblessness. The impact of a recession does, at the very least, raise questions about whether a minimum wage hike in and of itself caused joblessness. If you look instead at the five wage hikes that occurred when a recovery was under way, joblessness declined four of those times. The only exception was the 1991 wage hike, which took effect soon after a recovery began. Finally, we should note that economists are split over what effect a minimum wage hike has on job growth. There’s some research that shows raising the minimum wage negatively impacts job growth, and a lot that shows it has an insignificant effect. Our ruling Carson said, "Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases." If you look at the 12-month period following every minimum-wage hike since 1978, joblessness did rise on seven occasions, but it fell on four occasions, undercutting his sweeping claim. In addition, it’s not at all clear that a minimum-wage hike was the primary culprit for the periods in which joblessness rose, since those periods also coincided with broader recessions in the economy. We rate his claim False.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-11-10T22:46:38	2015-11-10	['None']
pomt-14668	Says Virginia Del. Mark Cole "wants schools to check children’s genitals before using bathroom."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/jan/18/occupy-democrats/occupy-democrats-grossly-twists-virginia-school-ba/	A left-leaning advocacy group says Del. Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania, has introduced a bill that would require students to show their privates before using a restroom in a public school in Virginia. "Virginia Republican wants schools to check children’s genitals before using bathroom," read the headline of a Jan. 12 web post by Occupy Democrats, a group started in 2012 to - in its own words - "counterbalance the Republican Tea Party." The ensuing article elaborated that Cole’s bill "would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their ‘anatomical sex.’" Similar claims have been posted on the websites of at least two other liberal groups: The Raw Story and Peacock Panache, triggering some Internet debate that isn’t exactly flattering to Cole. We wondered whether the description of Cole’s bill is accurate. School bathrooms have been a scalding issue in Cole’s district, where some parents have objected to a transgender student’s use of a girls’ lavatory at a Stafford County elementary school. Officials at the school initially allowed the student to use the girls’ room. But amid an outcry from some parents, the school board reversed that policy and instead directed the student to use a single-stall lavatory at the school, a staff bathroom, or the boys’ restroom. Cole’s bill would direct school boards across the state to develop policies to ensure that any public school restroom and locker room "designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation." The legislation defines "anatomical sex" as the "physical condition of being male or female, which is determined by a person’s anatomy." That measure, introduced Jan. 11, does not spell out exactly how school officials would verify a student’s gender. Colin Taylor, the managing editor of Occupy Democrats, and Omar Rivero, the group’s founder, told us in an email that the group "simply took Del. Mark Cole’s offensive proposal to its logical conclusion." "How else would an enforcing official determine whether or not the individual's anatomical sex matches Del. Cole's interpretation of binary gender designation?" they wrote. "Are they expecting children or adults to voluntarily turn themselves in? Will they have to submit to inspection by a doctor? Somebody will have to inspect to prove that an individual is or is not anatomically correct.’" But as our colleagues at the fact-checking website Snopes.com recently noted, there’s nothing in the bill explicitly calling for a genital inspection before students use the bathroom. There are, of course, other possibilities for verification, such as obtaining a doctor’s note, Snopes said. To clarify the matter, Cole introduced a second restroom bill Jan. 12 that calls for schools to verify a student’s "biological sex" by examining their birth certificate. Both his bills would carry a $50 civil fine for each violation by a student. Cole issued a written statement Jan. 13 accusing critics of mischaracterizing his bill, which he said attempts to provide clear policies on who can and can’t use a particular bathroom to shield school divisions from lawsuits. He said he introduced the bill at the request of parents in his district. "Contrary to what has been said about the legislation, it does NOT require genital checks," Cole wrote. He said the legislation would be enforced only when there was a complaint about a student’s choice of bathrooms. "If needed, gender could be verified by looking up student registration information or a birth certificate," he wrote. Cole told us on Jan. 15 that he will propose an amendment for his bill that will make it crystal clear it does not allow genital inspections. "It would be, I think, blatantly unconstitutional for someone to conduct such a search," Cole said. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said Cole "wants schools to check children’s genitals before using bathroom." There is nothing in Cole’s bill that says students will be forced to show their private parts to school officials before they can use the restroom. The group defends its statement by saying "it’s the logical conclusion" of legislation that’s silent on how it would be enforced. But there are other possibilities the group doesn’t consider. Cole suggests using birth certificates and student records to verify a student’s anatomical gender. The loose writing of the bill, which Cole is trying to tighten, leaves the legislator a little bit open to criticism. But it doesn’t entitle Occupy Democrats to make up a genital inspection claim and attach Cole’s name to it. We rate the group’s claim False.

pomt-01083	"About 30 percent" of those released from Guantanamo "have re-entered the fight."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/15/john-mccain/mccain-30-past-guantanamo-detainees-re-enter-fight/	Too many detainees released from Guantanamo are re-engaging in terrorism, according to several key Republicans pushing legislation to keep the prison open. Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte, N.H., Richard Burr, N.C., Lindsey Graham, S.C., and John McCain, Ariz., proposed a bill Jan. 13 that would restrict detainee transfers from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The bill would prohibit the transfer of high or medium-risk detainees and any transfers to Yemen, as well as increase transparency about detainees’ risk assessments, among other measures. President Barack Obama in recent months has ramped up the number of people he’s transferred out of Guantanamo, in hopes of closing the facility by the time his term ends. During his 2008 campaign, Obama promised to close the prison, which opened in 2002 during the war on terror, but 122 prisoners remain. At a press conference announcing the legislation, McCain, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, gave a statistic that he’s said before, regarding how many detainees go back to terrorism. "We know for a fact that roughly 30 percent of those who have been released have re-entered the fight, and usually at a very high level, because it's a badge of honor to have been an inmate at Guantanamo Bay," McCain said. "So instead we're going to continue to release batches of prisoners, according to this administration, with no plan, and the extreme likelihood that approximately one out of every three of them will re-enter the fight." Others critical of Obama’s policy on releasing Guantanamo detainees have recited the claim that 30 percent "re-enter the fight" -- including former Vice President Dick Cheney and Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. It turns out that the numbers aren’t that strong when broken down into their parts. The facts Determining how many released prisoners have "re-entered the fight" is not an exact science, and some dispute the numbers provided by the federal government, particularly because the government does not release the names of individuals on its list. How they arrive at their numbers is not transparent. Here’s what we do know: At least every six months, the Director of National Intelligence, an Obama appointee, publishes a Congress-mandated report detailing the number of former Guantanamo detainees who have re-engaged in terrorist or insurgent activity since the prison opened in 2002. The latest report was published in September 2014 and has data from July 2014. A quick scan of these numbers shows problems with the 30 percent re-engagement claims. Total detainees held since 2002: more than 750 Detainees released: 620 Former detainees confirmed of re-engaging: 107 (17.3 percent) Former detainees suspected of re-engaging: 77 (12.4 percent) To get near that 30 percent figure, we have to group together those confirmed of re-engaging and those suspected of re-engaging. Also, of those 107 confirmed of re-engaging, 48 are either dead or in custody. So in total, 59 of 620 released Guantanamo detainees -- or about 9 percent -- are confirmed by the government to have re-engaged in terrorism and are currently at large. In an email to PolitiFact, McCain spokesman Brian Rogers acknowledged that the 30 percent figure includes both the confirmed and suspected categories. (In the same press conference, Ayotte also cited the 30 percent statistic, but she was careful to note the distinction between confirmed and suspected cases.) Of the first 20 prisoners brought to Guantanamo, only eight remain, according to a report out of the Miami Herald. Of those 12 who are no longer at Guantanamo, only one is known to have re-engaged in terrorist activity. In June 2014, the New America Foundation, a centrist think tank, conducted its own investigation of the 620 released former detainees, using Pentagon reports, media stories and other public information. They found that 54 of them "are either confirmed to be or suspected of engaging in militant activities against either the U.S. or non-U.S. targets." This is about one-third of the government’s figure -- 184 confirmed or suspected of engaging in these activities. In a CNN article, the New America Foundation researchers said it is possible that the publicly available information they used might not have identified some of the former detainees who are engaged in terrorist activity. However, they said they are "confident" in their numbers because terrorist groups "are eager to trumpet the identities of released Guantanamo detainees who join their ranks." In its reports on recidivism rates, the foundation’s researchers have not argued for or against releasing prisoners or closing Guantanamo, but they have called on the government to be more transparent with its list of individuals included in their counts. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor and expert in national security at American University, said the government numbers are suspect because it’s unclear how the government proves that someone has re-engaged in these activities and how much evidence is required. "To paraphrase a Scottish writer, Sen. McCain and his colleagues are using these numbers the way drunks use lampposts—more for support than for illumination," Vladeck said. An ongoing trend? McCain doesn’t necessarily blame Obama outright for the recidivism rate. But, at the very least, he implied that former detainees re-engaging in terrorism is an ongoing trend: "We're going to continue to release batches of prisoners, according to this administration, with no plan, and the extreme likelihood that approximately one out of every three of them will re-enter the fight," he said. The numbers show that the majority of releases that have resulted in re-engagement happened before 2009 -- during former President George W. Bush’s administration. Here’s the total number of released detainees and their re-engagement rates broken down over those two periods: Pre-Jan. 22, 2009 (Bush) Post-Jan. 22, 2009 (Obama) Total detainees released 532 88 Confirmed of re-engaging 101 (19 percent) 6 (6.8 percent) Suspected of re-engaging 76 (14.3 percent) 1 (1.1 percent) We should note Obama has sped up the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries since mid November. The government transferred five Yemenis Jan. 13. This report only includes data up until July 2014. Rogers, McCain’s spokesman, pointed out that "it can take some time for us to identify (former detainees) on the field of battle, and it would make sense that some recent releases may not yet have been identified or engaged." According to the annual report, the Director of National Intelligence has come to expect some relapse into criminal activity from its former detainees, particularly if they are transferred to countries with active conflicts and terrorist recruiting operations. To McCain’s point that those who have "re-entered the fight" do so "usually at a very high level," DePaul University history professor Thomas Mockaitis said this isn’t necessarily the case. "Those released who have been out of the fight for so long would probably not have been important players any longer, if they ever were," he said. "So it is not clear how much their going back to terrorism mattered." He added that, "Neither al-Qaida or (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) is short of recruits." Our ruling McCain said "about 30 percent" of those released from Guantanamo "have re-entered the fight." Government numbers show 17 percent of former Guantanamo detainees are confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorist or insurgent activity, while 12 percent are just suspected of re-engaging. Accounting for those who have been killed or taken back into custody, about 9 percent are confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorism and are currently on the battlefield. Additionally, McCain implies that this is a recent trend, which doesn’t seem to be the case. There are also some experts who dispute the government’s figures.

pomt-06648	"In terms of the wealthiest Americans, we're at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/sep/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-tax-rates-lowest-195/	Before the Republican candidates for president took center stage in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011, for the CNN/Tea Party Express debate, Democratic National Committee chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz talked with CNN's Wolf Blitzer about the state of President Barack Obama's jobs bill. Wasserman Schultz was in Florida to counter the argument being made by many Republicans that since the stimulus didn't work, Obama's jobs bill won't either. In the middle of Wasserman Schultz's back-and-forth with Blitzer, the two had a disagreement about some tax figures. Blitzer tried to make the point that wealthy Americans might already pay their fair share while Wasserman Schultz countered that their tax rates are the lowest they've been since the 1950s. Here's the transcript of the conversation: BLITZER: You're here with a lot of Republicans here. You're a Democrat. We will talk politics in a moment. But do you think the Republican leadership in the House, Eric Cantor, John Boehner, they're serious when they say they're willing to compromise, willing to work with the president on this jobs bill? They hate some of it, but they're willing to accept some other parts? WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, I'm concerned that they're only willing to take up and consider the parts that are part of their record of supporting allowing the fox to guard the henhouse, focusing only on deregulation of business and not making sure that we can balance the investment, as well as the tax breaks, like the payroll tax. So I would like to take them at their word. BLITZER: From the White House perspective, it is not a take-it-or-leave-it $447 billion package. They're willing to negotiate, to compromise from the White House. Is that right? WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Oh, sure. From Day 1, President Obama has been willing to negotiate. We really haven't had willing partners on the other side. I'm certainly hopeful that the Republican leadership is willing to negotiate. But so far, they seem to only indicate that they will take up whatever it is they support and toss it back... BLITZER: But you shouldn't be overly surprised. They never want to increase taxes. And the president's plan is based in part at least on increasing taxes on wealthier Americans. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, you're right. The Republicans continue to refuse to ask for anything from the wealthiest and most fortunate Americans, to pay their fair share. They continue to want to pile all the pain on the backs of people who can least afford it, on the middle class, on small business owners, even though the overwhelming (number) of American people want there to be revenue and want there to be a balance between spending cuts and revenue. BLITZER: All right, we don't have to debate the whole issue of taxes and wealthy and all of that. (But) the wealthiest Americans, they pay the most in taxes already -- 50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax, because... WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No, that's actually not true, Wolf. BLITZER: Fifty percent, you don't... WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: We're at the low -- in terms of the wealthiest Americans, we're at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s. BLITZER: I know, but they pay a huge chunk of the federal income tax, the wealthiest Americans. The top 2 percent or 3 percent pay whatever that number is, 30 or 40 percent. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: But they're still at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s. BLITZER: Yes, 35 percent. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: And there have been significant tax breaks from President Obama. BLITZER: All right. We're not going to get into all of that. Blitzer decided to cut off the debate there; at PolitiFact, we're happy to continue. In a previous item, we measured Wasserman Schultz's assertion that Blitzer was wrong to say that "50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax." Blitzer had his numbers right, so we ruled Wasserman Schutlz's claim False. In this fact-check, we're examining Wasserman Schultz's claim that the wealthiest Americans have the lowest comparative "tax rate since the 1950s." PolitiFact has heard a take on this claim before -- from President Barack Obama. During negotiations on an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, Obama was asked at a press conference whether tax increases should be a part of a deal to approve a new debt ceiling. "You can't reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix," Obama said on June 29, 2011. "The revenue we're talking about isn't coming out of the pockets of middle-class families that are struggling -- it's coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and who are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born. If you're a -- if you are a wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They're lower than they've been since the 1950s." The most basic way to address this question is to use the highest marginal rates for ordinary income -- what's commonly called the "top tax bracket." This rate -- which today is 35 percent -- is applied to any money earned above a certain threshold. For 2011, that level is $379,150 for married couples filing jointly, for individuals and for heads of households, and $189,575 for married couples filing separately. Between 1960 and the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan pushed through landmark tax cuts, top tax brackets had much higher rates than those in place today. For instance, the top rate was 91 percent in 1960 and 70 percent on the eve of Reagan’s election in 1980. By 1988, the top federal income tax rate fell to 28 percent, and it stayed there until 1990. It ticked up to 31 percent for 1991 and 1992, before rising to 39.6 percent in 1993. So, for five tax years -- 1988 through 1992 -- the top tax bracket had a lower rate than today’s top bracket. Put another way, out of 52 tax years since 1960, the top tax rate was lower than today’s only 10 percent of the time. (Today's top tax bracket has been steady since 2003, so in nine additional tax years, the earlier bracket was tied with today's.) In considering Obama's statement we also looked at trying to measure the effective tax rate (as in what a typical taxpayer actually pays after deductions, exemptions and the like.) We won't go through the complicated analysis again -- you can read it here if you like. Suffice it to say, effective tax rates for high-earning Americans are either at their lowest level since 1960 or at least very close to their lowest level. As for Wasserman Schultz, she said: "In terms of the wealthiest Americans, we're at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s." Since 1960 the top marginal income tax rates -- the most common way to measure Wasserman Schultz's statement -- were lower only between 1988 and 1992 than they are today. With that caveat, we rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2011-09-13T14:28:48	2011-09-12	['United_States']
pomt-06294	"The median income of a middle class family went down $2,100 from 2001 to 2007."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/18/joe-biden/biden-says-middle-income-earners-lost-ground-reces/	Vice President Joe Biden visited a New Hampshire university Oct. 20, 2011, to promote President Barack Obama’s American Jobs Act before an audience whom he called "the 9/11 generation." Speaking to a full house inside Plymouth State University’s lecture hall, Biden talked about the need to restore the middle class and to bring jobs back to America. He said middle-income-earning Americans have been "under siege," long before the economic recession hit. "In the previous decade, before the current recession, the middle class was getting killed," said Biden. "During that period between 2001-07, productivity of American workers was up 20 percent, but median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100 during this time." Did the median of middle-income households really take a $2,100 hit before the economy hit the fan? We looked into Biden’s claim to find out. First we contacted Biden’s staff to find out which figures they were using to come to the $2,100 decrease in the median income for middle-class households. Tobin Marcus, Biden’s deputy economic policy adviser, told us the vice president was referring to real median household income for working age households. "We’re looking at the core wage-earning households as opposed to retirees," Marcus said. "Working age households" are typically considered houses headed by someone between the ages of 25 and 54, and the median income was chosen to represent middle income wage earners. Biden’s office cited the Census Bureau’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Surveys for year-ending data for 2000 and 2007. They said they compared inflation-adjusted numbers, using the "annual average" increase column of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index. We took a look at their numbers, and their calculations checked out. To be sure, we contacted Dennis Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies and a New Hampshire State Forecast Manager for the New England Economic Partnership. He confirmed the calculations Biden’s campaign provided. "I looked at the data sources, and they appear to be correct, and the data calculated correctly," Delay said. Delay then pointed us to a report by the Economic Policy Institute which used the same data. From 2000-07, the Institute said the real median income of working age households fell from $61,574 in 2000 to $59,460 in 2007—a decrease of $2,114. The White House Task Force on the Middle Class cited a "weak labor market" and "anemic job growth of the 2000s" among some of the problems that contributed to the approximately 3.4 percent decline in the median of middle class incomes over the seven years leading up to the economic recession. "Clearly median inflation adjusted income fell much faster during the recession (2007 to present)," Delay said. "But the fall in that indicator during a period of economic expansion (2000 to 2007) is very troubling. I don’t believe any other period of economic expansion saw a commensurate decline in median inflation adjusted income." Our ruling: Vice President Biden said the median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100 from 2001-07, and the numbers check out. We rate Biden’s claim True.

pomt-11881	"Ninety percent of people born in the 1940s ended up doing better financially than their parents. But those born in the 1980s, the much-maligned Millennials, have only a 50-50 chance of doing better (financially) than their parents, despite being the best-educated generation in our history."	true	/california/statements/2017/oct/27/delaine-eastin/do-millennials-have-only-50-50-chance-doing-better/	Candidate for California governor Delaine Eastin says she wants to create "an economy that works for everyone." But with the state’s affordable housing crisis and deep poverty, Eastin believes that’s not happening now, especially for young people. "People become cynical," she wrote in an Oct. 11, 2017 op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle "because the path to a brighter future is becoming more remote." Eastin continued: "Ninety percent of people born in the 1940s ended up doing better financially than their parents. But those born in the 1980s, the much-maligned Millennials, have only a 50-50 chance of doing better (financially) than their parents, despite being the best-educated generation in our history." Millennials are typically considered the children of the Baby Boomers and older Gen Xers. They were born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s. We wanted to know whether Eastin was right about this dramatic decline in children doing better than their parents. We set out on a fact check. Eastin’s background Eastin is one of several Democrats vying to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018. She served in the State Assembly from 1986 to 1994 and then as State Superintendent of Public Instruction from 1995 to 2003. She was the first, and remains, the only woman to hold that position. In addition to her desire to create a more equitable economy, Eastin has advocated for greater investment in education, the adoption of universal health care and continued work on climate change during her run for governor. Our research We asked Eastin’s campaign for evidence supporting her claim about millennials and their financial prospects. Jon Murchinson, her campaign spokesman, told us the statement is based on conclusions in a December 2016 study by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. The study is called "The Fading American Dream: Trends in Absolute Income Mobility since 1940." Its findings, indeed, show that the fraction of children earning more than their parents has plummeted -- from 90 percent for children born in the 1940s to 50 percent for those born in the 1980s. The study accounted for inflation, taxes and other changes between the generations. "It’s basically a coin flip as to whether you’ll do better than your parents," Stanford economist Raj Chetty, one of the study’s authors, said in a news release announcing the study’s publication in December 2016. SOURCE: The Equality of Opportunity Project Reached by email this week, Chetty told us Eastin’s characterization of this trend "appears accurate." David Grusky, the study’s co-author and director of Stanford’s Center on Poverty and Inequality, added that Eastin’s statement is "a fair summary of our headline conclusion." The Stanford study doesn’t examine whether millennials are the "best-educated generation in our history." That part of Eastin’s statement, however, was substantiated in a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. It found 27 percent of millennial women and 21 percent of millennial men had completed at least a bachelor’s degree by age 33. That was slightly higher than the percentages for men and women at the same age from Baby Boomer to Generation X populations. Inside the study While Eastin appears to have correctly represented the report’s findings, we wanted to know how the Stanford researchers came to their conclusions and whether other researchers agreed with them. Grusky told us the report used millions of Internal Revenue Service records and Census data to compare income between parents and children. The report specifically looked at people born between 1940 and 1984 and measured household income for parents and children when both were 30 years old. Even after accounting for changes between the generations, such as millennials entering the workforce at an older age than their parents, Grusky said the findings on upward mobility did not change significantly. Only slightly more than 50 percent of children at age 40 had higher income compared with their parents’ income when their parents were 30 years old. Unequal growth The Stanford study also accounted for the rapid economic growth experienced during the Baby Boomer generation, when the nation’s post-World War II economy created a surge of new jobs and industries. Assuming both generations had experienced the same economic growth rates, Grusky said only 62 percent of millennials would do better than their parents. The key factor holding back broader financial success of this younger generation, the report concluded, was today’s inequality of growth. Financial success, Grusky said, has become concentrated among a smaller share of families compared with the recent past. Ensuring that financial success is distributed more widely would "make a lot of headway" toward millennials doing better than their parents in future years, the researcher added. The report found declines in upward mobility for millennials across all 50 states. The biggest drops took place in Rust Belt states such as Ohio, Illinois and Michigan, Grusky said. Millennials in states such as California, New York and Massachusetts saw, on average, less substantial declines. SOURCE: The Equality of Opportunity Project For this study, Grusky said, researchers were not able to factor in student debt or address how people of different races and ethnicities are affected by the mobility trends. ‘Behind the starting line’ Tom Allison, deputy policy and research director at Young Invincibles, said the Stanford research "is right in line" with the conclusions reached by his Washington D.C.-based group. Young Invincibles advocates for expanding economic opportunities for young adults and encouraging them to get involved in the political process. Allison said the Stanford study is both transparent and relies on credible public data. Factors from the Great Recession to student debt to globalization have all put millennials "behind the starting line" compared with their parents, he said. "That is a cornerstone of the American Dream," Allison continued, "that if you work hard and play by the rules, then you can exceed the living standards of your parents. And we’ve seen a precipitous decline in that." Our ruling Delaine Eastin recently claimed millennials "have only a 50-50 chance" of doing better financially than their parents, while those born in the 1940s had a 90 percent chance of doing better than their parents. Her claim is supported by a 2016 Stanford study, "The Fading American Dream: Trends in Absolute Income Mobility since 1940." Stanford researchers found stronger economic growth combined with a broader distribution of that growth during the Baby Boomer generation drove greater upward mobility for people born in the 1940s. They said financial success has become more concentrated in recent decades, leaving millennials with much lower odds of doing better than their parents. Even after accounting for changes, such as inflation and millennials starting work at older ages, they found today’s younger generation faces comparatively smaller odds of earning more than their parents. Other research, notably by the advocacy group Young Invincibles, agreed with the Stanford findings. We rate her claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-10731	"Congress' approval rating is 11 percent. You know who's higher? Dick Cheney and HMOs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/15/bill-richardson/congress-and-cheney-beat-hmos/	Gov. Bill Richardson took a humorous jab at his fellow candidates who serve in Congress during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Nov. 15, 2007, saying their approval ratings are lower than Dick Cheney's and HMOs'. First of all, Congress' approval rating is not as low as 11 percent. Polls in October 2007 have hovered between 19 and 28 percent. Vice President Cheney's approval rating is not polled as often as Congress, but his most recent approval rating, in October 2007, was 23 percent. Polls on health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are even less frequent. But the Gallup Poll annually queries the public on opinions about the honesty and integrity of specific professions. The most recent poll in December 2006 rated HMO managers with approval ratings of about 12 percent, just above advertising practitioners and car salesmen. In fact, in that poll, both senators and congressman rated higher than HMO managers. Senators were at 15 percent and congressman were at 14 percent. So Richardson is wrong on all counts. Congress and Cheney are arguably neck-and-neck for approval ratings, while HMO managers lag behind. We rate his claim False.

pomt-12051	"Just in our first six months in office, Missouri moved up the rankings nine places ... of the best states to do business."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/10/eric-greitens/greitens-claim-improving-business-climate-half-tru/	Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens recently announced the launch of a new website aimed at cutting the red tape that he believes is negatively impacting Missouri businesses. This is but one of the initiatives Greitens has taken to grow business in Missouri. In a Facebook Live Q&A (at the 4:48 mark) on Aug. 23, 2017, Greitens shared that Missouri’s economy is on the rise, thanks to his work on cutting regulations. "Just in our first six months in office, Missouri moved up the rankings nine places … in the rankings of the best states to do business," Greitens said in the Facebook Live video. Is that true? One list among many Parker Briden, Greitens’ press secretary, said the governor was citing CNBC’s annual list of America’s Top States for Business, which was published July 11. Missouri moved up nine spaces in 2017, from 31 to 22. Among other lists regarding the best states to do business is Forbes and Chief Executive, both placing Missouri at 25, falling within the range calculated by CNBC for its 2016 and 2017 lists. Five other lists also saw an increase in ranking for Missouri. Another site worth noting is Site Selection, which does not update its ranking until later this year. This could impact how progress is ultimately seen for states like Missouri. While consistent in nature, experts point out that compiling these rankings takes time, indicating that Greitens‘ "mission to turn Missouri around," as his campaign website states, might not truly be all his doing. "Much, if not most, of the data that goes into this ranking was collected more than six months ago. Thus, it may be a little premature to take credit for these changes," said Jeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. While these lists can garner a lot of media attention, they should be viewed cautiously. "The issue of ranking states as ‘best for business’ makes for interesting reading, but I expect most serious economists would be skeptical of any one approach," said Lee McPheters, an economist at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. CNBC’s methodology CNBC’s analysis compares states among 66 factors across 10 categories. The study takes into account what each state deems the most important to its business environment by analyzing each state’s economic development marketing materials. The 10 categories are workforce, infrastructure, cost of doing business, economy, quality of life, technology and innovation, education, business friendliness, access to capital and cost of living. Each category comes with individual point weights. The rankings are based mainly on publicly available sources from federal databases. Methodologies vary across different business surveys. "There are many of these studies with varying methodology and there is not usually a lot of solid economic research to back up most of them," McPheters said. McPheters points out that, in order to see progress for a state, the numbers do not necessarily need to match up, but there must be a consistent improvement among the differing lists. Our ruling Greitens, talking on Facebook Live about his first six months as Missouri governor, said, "Just in our first six months in office, Missouri moved up the rankings nine places … in the rankings of the best states to do business." Greitens credited this change to his cutting regulations, which he said is prompting a rise in the state’s economy. CNBC moved Missouri up nine spots on its annual America’s Top States for Business list. That’s only one ranking, among many, that can be considered, and it’s impossible to say that its methodology is perfect. Experts suggest that, while the methodologies of these lists vary significantly, it might be better to derive a decision if Missouri’s ranking has increased on all of them, which is true among five other lists. However, experts said it is premature for Greitens to assume credit for the improvement in rankings. Greitens is partially accurate. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-10830	"Dr. Paul never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/17/ron-paul/a-few-exceptions-to-his-small-government-principle/	Paul's campaign Web site declares: "Dr. Paul never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution." There is no hedging in that promise. Indeed, Paul has earned the nickname "Dr. No" because he has a long history of standing against the tide on even very popular measures because he disagreed on principle. But "never" is a tough standard to meet, and 17 years in Congress covers an awful lot of votes. An examination of Paul's record shows that although he usually adheres to his principle, he has sometimes voted for programs that aren't "expressly authorized" in the Constitution. For example, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he voted to authorize the continuing operation of NASA and to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday on the third Monday in January. More recently, he voted to change federal law governing organ transplants to make it easier for people to receive donated kidneys. He voted to designate the Ellis Island Library as the "Bob Hope Memorial Library." And he voted to change federal law so the American flag would be displayed on Father's Day. The Constitution discusses many things, but there's nothing that "expressly authorizes" organ transplant law, naming rights for libraries or flags on Father's Day. When we sent the Paul campaign an e-mail asking for an explanation of these votes, spokesman Jesse Benton declined to discuss them in detail. He quibbled over whether the measures technically could be considered legislation. "Your argument over semantics sounds more like a fishing expedition than good journalism," he said. Benton later e-mailed to say that one explanation for the NASA vote was that the agency "has a national security component." We checked with a congressional historian and two constitutional law professors who said they believe those votes do not meet Paul's claim. A.E. Dick Howard, a law professor at the University of Virginia, said Paul's claim "just doesn't stand up. ...My guess is you could find a hundred other examples." So we find that Paul's absolutist statement "never" is false.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2007-09-17T00:00:00	2007-09-17	['None']
pomt-05346	Says "I am happy to decline PERS so that the County can save over $68,000 over a four year term that would have been paid on my behalf."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/may/11/john-ludlow/will-clackamas-county-taxpayers-save-68000-over-fo/	In a previous item, PolitiFact Oregon ruled True a statement by John Ludlow, a candidate for Clackamas County Commission chair, that he is the only person in the four-way race who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System. He faces Clackamas County Commission chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county commissioner Paul Savas and state Rep. Dave Hunt in Tuesday’s election. Snubbing PERS is a nice symbolic pledge for someone running on a platform of limited government. It also won’t hurt Ludlow, who is 63 years old, as much as it would someone who is further away from retirement. But the next part of Ludlow’s claim really caught our attention. In a Facebook post dated March 30, he wrote, "I am happy to decline PERS so that the County can save over $30,000 per year that would have been paid on my behalf." (The post was changed Tuesday; we’ll explain below.) That sounded like a lot of money saved, given that a county commissioner’s annual salary is $81,000. We checked it out. In doing so, Ludlow clarified to PolitiFact Oregon and on Facebook that by declining PERS, "the County can save over $68,000 over a four year term that would have been paid on my behalf." We asked Ludlow why he had claimed $30,000 in savings a year, and now $68,000 over four years. He said it’s hard getting solid numbers from the Public Employees Retirement System. "I am now satisfied that the last numbers quoted by me are the correct numbers," he wrote us. Hmmm. We don’t think politicians, aspiring or otherwise, should claim savings without evidence. That’s careless. But let’s get back to how much county taxpayers will save should Ludlow decline retirement benefits. The county position pays $80,868 a year This is how public retirement payments work: Every employer pays a "contribution rate," depending on the type of employer and type of employee. The rates are set in advance. In the case of Clackamas County, the employer contribution rate is 11.99 percent for general service workers for the 2011-13 budget period. The 11.99 percent includes 6.13 percent that the employer puts in for a member’s retirement, plus 5.86 percent to cover the system’s "unfunded actuarial liability," or the money needed to pay for current and future retirees. In addition, the county pays -- or "picks up" -- the 6 percent the employee is required to contribute on his or her behalf. That adds up to $14,500 a year. But David Crosley, a spokesman for PERS, said the actual amount of money saved -- or avoided -- should Ludlow decline is closer to $9,800 a year, or a little more than $39,000 over four years. That’s because the county needs to kick in for unfunded actuarial liability anyway, regardless of whether Ludlow declines PERS for himself. "That amount gets spread over fewer people," Crosley said. "They’re not saving that in the long term." But let’s look at this from the county’s perspective, which is what Ludlow relies on. Marc Gonzales, the county’s finance director, confirmed the county budgets about $17,247 a year per commissioner for retirement-related costs. Why is it higher? In part, because the county calculates the figure with longer-term employees in mind, and they have higher retirement costs. Tim Heider, a spokesman for Clackamas County, wrote in an email that "the county would not incur any PERS cost for an employee who declines enrollment." So we’ve gone from $30,000 a year to roughly $17,000 a year to $9,800 a year. It’s undeniable that Ludlow will save taxpayers money by declining to join PERS, should he win. But he’s off on how much, and whether it would have been paid on his behalf. It’s certainly not the $30,000 a year he originally claimed. It may be $17,000 as he now claims, but that’s because the county has budgeted generously. (Ludlow as a new member will not cost taxpayers as much as employees who have been in the system for a long time.) The Public Employees Retirement System estimates money that would have gone to him is closer to $10,000 a year. Ludlow’s revised statement is partially true but missing information.

pomt-00177	Says Katie Porter is part of a "radical group of Democrats with an extreme agenda to abolish ICE."	false	/california/statements/2018/oct/22/mimi-walters/katie-porter-has-called-immigration-reform-not-abo/	U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters connected her challenger Katie Porter to Democrats who have voiced support for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE. But how true is Walters’ attack? The mailer from Walters to residents of California’s 45th Congressional District claims the "press has reported that Katie Porter is part of a radical group of Democrats running for Congress" and says she has an "extreme agenda" that supports abolishing ICE. It goes on to criticize Porter for supporting sanctuary city laws and that she wants free college and Medicare for illegal immigrants. For the purposes of this fact-check, we focused on the claim that Porter’s agenda includes abolishing ICE. It actually doesn’t. What media reports is the mailer referring to? The Walters campaign told us that the ICE charge comes from a McClatchy DC bureau article from Sept. 14. But the news story doesn’t back up the mailer’s claim. McClatchy reported that Porter is part of a "battery" of "even more liberal" candidates pushing for single-payer health care and abolishing ICE. The original version of the article had a sentence that said Porter and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York have both "pushed the ideological envelope for the party’s progressive wing, even popularizing once-radical positions like single-payer health care or abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency." This line was featured on the mailer. However, that reference was updated and clarified in the story three days later. (We spoke with McClatchy reporter Alex Roarty, who confirmed the change.) The section now reads that the candidates have "pushed the ideological envelope for the party’s progressive wing. Porter has embraced the once-radical position of single-payer health care while Ocasio-Cortez supports abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency." Perhaps a minor alteration in the story, but it’s a big hit on the accuracy of the mailer’s claim that Porter wants to abolish ICE. What Katie Porter has said about ICE Democrats have argued in the past that ICE, which formed in the aftermath of 9/11, needs to be abolished to prevent mistreatment of undocumented immigrants. But the notion gained new life over the summer amid stories of migrant children being separated from their families at the U.S. border. Porter’s campaign said she does not want to abolish ICE. We did not find evidence that she has called for ending the agency like some other candidates. The campaign pointed us to a Mercury News article from August. The story discusses how none of the Democrats running in the 10 most competitive House races in California support dissolving the agency, citing a survey of the candidates. It then lists each candidate’s comments on ICE, and quotes Porter saying that the immigration agency "should be focused on its core public safety mission, not targeting families. The real issue here is the failure of Donald Trump’s leadership." On her campaign website, Porter says that she believes the U.S. needs immigration reform "that will provide a fair pathway to citizenship for those who are undocumented." Our ruling Walters claimed that Porter has an extreme liberal agenda that supports abolishing ICE. The mailer relies on a news article that said she supports such actions, but that piece has since been updated, stopping short of saying the Democrat wants to do away with the agency and mentioning her position for single-payer health care instead. We also found comments from Porter expressing frustration with the agency, and that she supports changes to it, but not dissolving it completely. The claim is inaccurate, so we rate it False.

pomt-10890	"We now have the greatest income inequality since the Great Depression."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/jun/12/john-edwards/economists-find-large-income-gap/	Indeed, economists have found that the top tier of Americans earn a disproportionately large percent of the income, and they almost always have. The income gap narrowed just after the Great Depression but has been climbing since -- most sharply in the 1980s and 1990s. An analysis of income tax returns by economists Emmanuel Saez at the University of California, Berkley, and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics found that income going to the top 1 percent doubled from 8 percent of total income earned in the workforce in 1980 to 16 percent in 2004, and reached pre-Depression levels in 2005.

"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/08/blog-posting/no-roy-moore-accuser-didnt-tamper-or-forge-yearboo/	A conspiracy-minded website attempted to cast doubt on evidence presented by one of eight women who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct in a misleading headline days ahead of the Alabama Senate race. "WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO)," the headline reads on The Gateway Pundit. We found similar posts on Breitbart, "Roy Moore Accuser Beverly Nelson Admits She Forged Yearbook," and on the blog Silence is Consent, "Roy Moore accuser admits she forged yearbook inscription." Beverly Young Nelson accused Roy Moore of groping her when she was 16 years old and he, in his 30s, was the deputy district attorney of Etowah County. As evidence, Nelson presented a note she said Moore wrote in her high school yearbook before the incident took place. Nelson has been represented by celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred. The inscription reads, "To a sweeter, more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore, D.A." Below the signature reads 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House. Moore’s defenders have pointed out the date and place seem to have been written in different ink and handwriting than the note. In a Dec. 8 Good Morning America interview with Nelson about Moore’s response to the allegations (he denies them) and her experience since taking her story public, Nelson addressed the inconsistency. Nelson said she added the date and place of the inscription. "He signed your yearbook?" ABC News reporter Tom Llamas asked Nelson. "He did sign it," Nelson said. "And you made some notes underneath?" Llamas asked. "Yes," Nelson said. "Nelson said she did make notes to the inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore," the video voiceover says. To summarize, Nelson says she added the time and location to the inscription. But she says the note and signature was from Moore. That’s not what the headlines of the Gateway Pundit, Breitbart or Silence is Consent. All three say Nelson said she either tampered with Moore’s signature or forged the inscription. There’s no evidence of that. Yet, the Gateway Pundit wrote that "Nelson admitting that she added to Moore’s alleged signature is the final nail in the coffin," the story reads. "Allred’s accuser is nothing but a fame-seeking fraud." Fox News made a similar misstatement in their headline and story about the ABC report, which they later walked back. "Roy Moore accuser admits she forged part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama Senate candidate," the original Fox News headline read. It was later edited to say she wrote, rather than forged, part of the inscription. The story did not include a clarification or correction when we last looked at it. The original Fox News story also said Nelson "wrote part of the disputed note" without specifying what she wrote, whereas the edited version clarified that "she added the date and place in the inscription." Our ruling The Gateway Pundit’s headline reads "WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO)." But Nelson does not claim she tampered with Moore’s actual signature. She said she added a time and location below the signature. Nelson still attributes the note and signature to Moore. We rate the statement Pants on Fire. Correction (Dec. 11, 2017): We originally described the women's allegations against Roy Moore as sexual assault. We believe sexual misconduct is a more accurate phrase and have changed the story accordingly.

pomt-09453	"There's almost 1 million Texans who are unemployed and that's an all-time record number in our state."	true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/06/bill-white/white-says-almost-1-million-people-are-unemployed-/	Former Houston Mayor Bill White, who won the 2010 Democratic nomination for governor Tuesday, wasted no time attacking Gov. Rick Perry's legacy. Hint: White doesn't think it's shaping up so well. "Rick Perry and his consultants and his insiders will take credit for all the good times in Texas," White said. "But they won't take responsibility for the fact that today, there's almost 1 million Texans who are unemployed and that's an all-time record number in our state." The gauntlet is thrown. Do the jobless numbers back White up? According to the Texas Workforce Commission, more than one million people were unemployed in January, but that includes seasonal employees who were laid off after the holidays. The seasonally-adjusted data shows that 996,863 were unemployed — about 3,000 shy of 1 million. That number has been increasing steadily since early 2008. The latest count also is a Texas record, topping the 765,894 residents who were out of work in October 1986. But a head count isn't the only way to judge joblessness over time. We looked at the rate of unemployment, too. The state rate — 8.2 percent as of January — has also crept up since 2008, due at least in part to a nationwide recession. But it hasn't yet matched the worst times of the 1980s recession in Texas, which was driven by an oil bust. The monthly unemployment rate peaked twice that decade, reaching 8.4 percent in January 1983 and 9.3 percent in September 1986. The annual unemployment stats are similar. The 2009 unemployment rate was 7.6 percent — the same as the rate in 1992. But the state's annual unemployment rate has been higher; it was 8.5 percent in 1987 and 8.9 percent in 1986. So the unemployment rate isn't yet at its highest in Texas — not that having the third highest rate is anything to celebrate. Anyway, White didn't cast the rate as highest-ever. Nor did Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, when he blasted Perry on primary election night for an "unemployment rate (that's) higher than it's been in decades." Two decades, to be precise. White is correct that the number of unemployed Texans — almost 1 million — is an all-time high. We rate his statement as True.

pomt-05395	Says we could have saved ourselves the cost of building the Powell Butte water reservoir.	false	/oregon/statements/2012/may/05/eileen-brady/could-city-portland-have-saved-itself-cost-buildin/	Portland’s tap water is a big deal. We’ve had impassioned debates over covering the open reservoirs that hold our drinking water at Mount Tabor and at Washington Park, which are lovely to look at but considered unsafe by the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency ordered the city to find a way to quit drinking from the uncovered reservoirs. In response, the Portland Water Bureau agreed to build underground water storage facilities elsewhere and to take open reservoir water offline. Asked about rising utility rates, Eileen Brady said she wouldn’t have spent money complying with the requirement: "In the Water Bureau, I probably this year wouldn’t have worked to fund some of the projects that are going to invest in covering our reservoirs. For instance, the Powell Butte project that is going up. I think we started too early on that. We could have saved ourselves the cost." Could we have saved ourselves the cost? This is the kind of statement that perturbs Water Bureau officials, who argue they had to prepare to comply. The city was required to have an EPA-approved reservoir replacement timeline by April 1, 2009 (that’s in the rule). In May 2011, the council approved an $80 million contract with a California company to build the tank. (This 2008 letter makes clear that the EPA was bent on compliance.) Brady, a longtime advocate of leaving Portland’s water alone, says she would have pushed to halt money for the Powell Butte project. After all, her campaign says, look at U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY, who complained about the one-size-fits all nature of the mandate. The EPA agreed to review the rule. But as we pointed out in a previous PolitiFact, Oregon is not New York and our pleas went nowhere. Brady claims we could have saved ourselves the trouble. Maybe we could have, but that April 1, 2009, deadline was set in rule. Our federal delegation was getting nowhere with D.C. until Schumer complained. Her statement is wishful.

pomt-02764	"John Cornyn has voted to increase the debt, raise taxes, bail out Wall Street banks and fund Obamacare."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/dec/12/senate-conservatives-fund/cornyn-backed-wall-street-bailout-and-law-hiking-t/	As U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas drew a surprise challenger, a political action committee suggested the second-term senator hasn’t always voted right. Shortly before the Dec. 9, 2013, filing deadline for Texas candidates, U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Friendswood withdrew his filing to seek re-election and instead submitted paperwork to challenge Cornyn and others for the party’s 2014 Senate nomination. Politico said in a news story posted that day that Stockman’s entry could force Cornyn "to tack farther right as he tries to win over a corner of the party that has recently been skeptical of him." The story later quoted a representative of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a PAC founded by former Republican Sen. James DeMint, as heralding Stockman’s foray into the race. "We haven’t decided yet whether we will endorse Steve Stockman, but we’re glad he is running," Matt Hoskins, the group’s leader, said in a statement. "Texas deserves two conservative fighters in the Senate, not just one. John Cornyn has voted to increase the debt, raise taxes, bail out Wall Street banks and fund Obamacare. He’s part of the problem in Washington and voters deserve an alternative." Votes to hike the debt and taxes, bail out banks--and to fund Obamacare? We were curious. Bailout vote Let’s get the bailout, um, out of the way. On Oct. 1, 2008, Cornyn was on the prevailing "aye" side of the Senate when the body voted 74-25 in favor of a $700 billion package to rescue the financial markets, including Wall Street banks. He and fellow Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison both voted for the proposal. On May 17, 2010, CNN quoted Cornyn as sticking by his support for the Wall Street bailout program that subsequently turned out to be unpopular with voters. The measure, Cornyn said, "was represented to us as an absolute necessity or else the economy would melt down and we'd experience a repeat of perhaps the depression of the '30s. I'm responsible and proud of the vote I cast at the time because I thought it was a public necessity." Cornyn noted to CNN, though, that he later voted to end the Troubled Asset Relief Program "even though I voted for it initially because I think it's been abused and I think the American people are experiencing bailout fatigue and now we're being asked to share in part of the bailout of Greece through the International Monetary Fund through our contribution there. So I don't blame people who are upset with the way that the bailouts have grown and been abused. But I think at the time it was the right decision to make." He added, according to CNN: "People understand that sometimes you have to make unpopular decisions of necessity. At the time it was the right decision to make." Increasing debt Has Cornyn voted to increase debt? By email, Hoskins pointed out that on Aug. 2, 2011, Cornyn voted to increase the federal debt limit by $2.4 trillion. Historically, Congress raises the debt limit so the government can continue paying its creditors. And, as Josh Gordon of the Virginia-based Concord Coalition, which focuses on fiscal policy, reminded us by email, votes to lift the ceiling are not the same as raising debt. "The vote to increase the debt ceiling has no bearing on levels of debt--which are determined by votes for spending policy and tax policy," Gordon wrote. "By the time it comes to vote on the debt ceiling, the decisions to increase the debt have already been made, and the debt limit increase is just allowing the country to continue operating economically." Regardless, congressional debates leading up to the latest debt-limit hikes have been boisterous with Republican opponents saying the increases wouldn’t be acceptable without simultaneous spending cuts. According to online Senate vote tallies, though, Cornyn voted against the latest debt-limit bump, approved by the Senate Oct. 16, 2013. Then again, he voted for the August 2011 hike noted by Hoskins and earlier voted in favor of Congress raising the limit on May 23, 2003; on Nov. 17, 2004; and on March 16, 2006, Senate tallies show. On the flip side, he also voted against the measure raising the limit as approved by the Senate by 53 to 42 on Sept. 27, 2007 and against another successful increase, wrapped into housing reform legislation, on July 26, 2008. An Oct. 15, 2013, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service lists half a dozen other votes to raise the debt limit with Cornyn in the Senate; we didn’t check on how he stood on those. Raising taxes On Jan. 1, 2013, Hoskins said, John Cornyn voted for the "fiscal cliff tax hike that raised taxes by $600 billion and forced nearly 80% of Americans to pay higher taxes," referring to the American Taxpayer Relief Act. As noted in a Jan. 2, 2013, Associated Press news article, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C., estimated that 77 percent of U.S. households would face higher taxes overall thanks to the approved act, mostly because the law did not extend a temporary reduction in the Social Security payroll tax worth about $1,000 to a worker making $50,000 annually. Hoskins cited a Jan. 1, 2013, blog post by the conservative Heritage Foundation for his $600 billion figure, which the post described as the amount of additional federal revenue the government expected to reap over 10 years thanks to the measure. The act had multiple elements, as summarized Jan. 1, 2013, by The Washington Post. Most significantly, income tax rates were permanently increased for families with annual incomes above $450,000 and individuals earning more than $400,000, but rates did not change for taxpayers earning less. The wealthiest Americans also had to start paying a higher tax on capital gains and dividends. Among other features, the law left the payroll tax break for employees to expire, the Post noted, while temporary business tax breaks—benefiting everything from R&D and wind energy to race-car track owners—were extended a year. In a Jan. 1, 2013, statement issued after he voted, Cornyn said: "I voted for this bill because it prevents a huge tax increase on 99% of all Texans and Americans." He was referring to income tax rate reductions put in place under President George W. Bush being preserved for all but the super-rich. "Nonetheless," Cornyn said, "I am dismayed at the lack of seriousness by the president on dealing with the core issues of our fiscal problems. Our spending is unsustainable and it is high time the president and his party engage in meaningful dialogue to get this county's spending under control." Funding Obamacare The Obamacare law, formally the Affordable Care Act, came to be in 2010 without drawing a single Republican vote and Cornyn, like many Republicans, has been a critic/foe of the law widening access to health insurance in part by requiring most Americans to purchase coverage. Hoskins said, though, that Cornyn twice voted to fund the law. On March 20, 2013, Hoskins noted, Cornyn voted for final passage of the fiscal 2013 appropriations act, with first-term Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and 25 other senators voting no. And on Sept. 27, 2013, Hoskins said, Cornyn voted to bring Senate debate to a close on the fiscal 2014 appropriations act "and to allow an up-or-down vote on the Democratic amendment to fund Obamacare." Cruz and 16 other senators voted no. By email, Cornyn campaign spokesman Drew Brandewie pointed out a July 29, 2013, analysis by the Congressional Research Service indicating that failures to fund the government might not have stopped spending related to the Obamacare law. According to the analysis, U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., had asked the service what would happen to the health care law’s implementation in the event of a lapse in appropriation funding, resulting in a government shutdown. The service replied that "substantial" implementation might continue because the government could draw on other funding sources and agencies are permitted to continue to perform certain activities even if appropriations are stalled. Also, the service, said, after the government asked Congress for more than $1 billion to implement Obamacare provisions in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2013, no such money was appropriated; the government found the dollars from other federal kitties. If Congress similarly resisted an administration request for $1.4 billion in implementation money in fiscal 2014, the service said, "it seems likely that the administration will continue to rely on alternative sources of funding to support" Obamacare "activities." Our ruling The PAC said Cornyn "has voted to increase the debt, raise taxes, bail out Wall Street banks, and fund Obamacare." It's not that simple. Cornyn voted for the 2008 bailout and has occasionally voted to raise the debt ceiling. Also, Cornyn’s 2013 vote for the taxpayer-relief act raised taxes for most households though, signficantly, it also preserved lower income-tax rates than ones that would have hit if the measure didn’t make it into law. Finally, the idea that Cornyn voted to fund Obamacare by agreeing to general appropriations is a political turnip; how those votes are interpreted probably depends on one’s political prism. Beyond that, the government evidently can tap the funding it needs to implement the law regardless of congressional spending decisions. Cornyn voted against the Obamacare law when it came to be and continues to oppose it. We rate this partially accurate claim, which takes some votes out of context, as Half True.

pomt-08266	"One of the interesting things about the Recovery Act was most of the projects came in under budget, faster than expected, because there's just not a lot of work there."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/10/barack-obama/obama-claims-most-stimulus-projects-have-come-unde/	President Barack Obama says the time is ripe for immediate investment in infrastructure projects such as highways and bridges. With the nation recovering from a recession, interest rates are low, competition among contractors for work is intense and the cost of building materials are down. As evidence, Obama pointed to the government's experience with the economic stimulus package, saying that taxpayers have gotten pretty good bang for their buck. "One of the interesting things about the Recovery Act was most of the projects came in under budget, faster than expected, because there's just not a lot of work there," Obama said in an interview on 60 Minutes on Nov. 7, 2010. "I mean, there are construction crews all across the country that are dying for work. And companies that are willing to take a very small profit in order to get work done. And so for us to say now's the time for us to rebuild this country and equip ourselves for the 21st Century. That's something that could make a real difference." In the fall campaign, Republicans assailed the stimulus as wasteful spending, but now Obama is citing it as an example of efficiency. And so we decided to collaborate with our colleagues at ProPublica to see if Obama was right that "most" of the projects funded by the stimulus came in "under budget" and "faster than expected." We'll break this into two parts: whether most stimulus projects came in under budget, and whether they were faster than expected. Under budget? There is no comprehensive federal database that tracks whether stimulus projects have come in under budget. But the White House pointed us toward Vice President Joe Biden’s latest stimulus report, issued in early October, which found that "Contract bids, in some cases, have come in anywhere from 6 to 20 percent below expected costs, allowing agencies to do more work within their original appropriations." But that was based on a limited sample -- an administration survey of eight agencies with a large number of infrastructure projects. The survey found that project bids came in about $8.5 billion less than anticipated, allowing the stimulus to fund more than 3,000 additional projects. The bulk of the "bid savings" in the survey came from the Department of Transportation, where low bids for projects came in $7.5 billion less than expected, allowing the department to fund an additional 2,500 projects. But DOT wasn't alone. All of the agencies surveyed reported projects coming in under budget. In the Department of Veterans Affairs, for example, project bids came in 8 to 12 percent below estimates, allowing the VA to stretch its number of funded projects from 942 to 1,521. Those figures come as little surprise to industry experts who said that projects in the last couple of years have often been below estimates. The recession decimated the construction industry, which led to intense competition for public projects like those funded by the stimulus. Whereas most projects would typically get five or six bidders, they now get 20 to 25 -- heightening pressure for lower bids, said Brian Turmail, a spokesman for the Associated General Contractors of America. In a survey of its membership near the beginning of 2010, 90 percent said they had lowered their bids that year; and 10 percent said they were even bidding below the cost of the project, "buying work," just to keep employees busy until things pick up, Turmail said. Another factor: Construction estimates were unusually high in 2006 and 2007, when many estimates were first made. They were inflated by strong demand for construction and high materials costs. As a result, officials began revising their estimating formulas to account for higher costs, at the very time when costs for construction goods and services actually were coming down. As a result, many projects in 2008 and 2009 -- prime time for the stimulus -- came in well under budget. The U.S. Government Accountability Office confirmed the trend in a March report. "Many highway contracts were awarded for less than the original cost estimates," the report states. "These 'bid savings' allowed states to fund more projects with the Recovery Act funding than were initially anticipated." For example, an Interstate 59 pavement project in Gadsden, Ala., came in 31 percent below the original estimate of $53.9 million. The 8-mile Old Glenn Highway resurfacing project in Anchorage, Alaska, was nearly 50 percent below the original estimate of $25 million. So there is some truth to Obama's point. But without definitive data telling us what percentage of all stimulus projects have come in under budget, we think it's a stretch for Obama to claim that most stimulus projects have come in under budget. After all, that's based on a survey of just eight agencies that found "contract bids, in some cases" were coming in well below budget. Faster than expected? This statistic depends somewhat on who is doing the expecting. Asked for backup, the White House again pointed to its October report, which noted the administration met its target of "outlaying," or spending, 70 percent of the stimulus funds by the end of September 2010. The administration also provided data on various deadlines met, or exceeded, to "obligate" money to various agencies. But "obligated" simply means the money has been committed to a project. It could take months before it's spent. So back to the money "outlaid." Shortly after the law passed, the administration set a goal of having 70 percent of the funds outlaid and delivered in tax relief by Sept. 30, 2010. In the report, the administration boasted that as of that deadline, the government had outlaid $308 billion and paid out $243 billion in tax relief - a total of $551 billion, or almost exactly 70 percent of the Act's $787 billion cost estimate at the time of enactment. Liz Oxhorn, a White House spokeswoman for the stimulus program, defended Obama's "faster than expected" claim based on outlays, saying, "Because most projects pay out on the back end, money out the door is one of the best indicators that projects are being completed ahead of schedule." But if outlays are the measuring stick, the projects have not come in "faster than expected," they have come in exactly as expected. And a couple caveats are in order here. The stimulus bill contained $288 billion in tax cuts and $499 billion in spending. As of Sept. 30, 85 percent of the tax cuts had been issued, along with 62 percent of the spending. In other words, the 70 percent threshold is inflated a bit by tax breaks. An analysis by ProPublica also found that a number of agencies were lagging behind spending estimates. The Department of Energy, for example, has been the slowest agency to spend its stimulus funds, as many of the agency's programs have been tied up by an onslaught of applications and regulations regarding prevailing wages, American-made materials, increasing electricity rates and environmental clearances. As of Sept. 17, it has spent only $7.6 billion of its $32.7 billion allocation. The slowest energy programs include the $3 billion "clean coal" carbon capture program, the $4.5 billion smart grid program and the $2.5 billion loan guarantee program to support clean energy projects. The Department of Homeland Security spent less than $500 million of its $2.8 billion allocation. When the stimulus bill was passed, the CBO estimated that Homeland Security would spend more than $1 billion by now. The slow spending comes from nearly every part of the agency. For example, Customs and Border Protection has paid out less than $50 million, even though it was authorized to spend $680 million to modernize ports of entry and deploy other border technology. That program was halted briefly last fall as news media and members of Congress questioned the plan to modernize little-used border stations in Montana and North Dakota instead of busy crossings along the southwest border. While outlays may be a good measure of the progress of stimulus spending, we also think most people would interpret Obama's comment to mean that projects were actually being done faster than expected. Again, there is no comprehensive federal database tracking that statistic. But ProPublica analyzed a piece of the stimulus, the money awarded to the Federal Highway Administration. Of the 12,932 projects listed in a database provided by the agency, 5,752 are marked as completed, about 45 percent. Of the completed projects, 51 percent were completed earlier than the estimated date. About 30 percent came in late and 12 percent on the same day. Several hundred projects had no estimated date. In the case of the Federal Highway Administration, Obama could rightly claim that "most" projects have come in faster than expected (though barely, at 51 percent). But this is just one agency. As with the claim about projects coming in under budget, Obama would have been on firm ground had he said "many" projects have come in faster than expected. Many have. But many have not. And if the claim is based on meeting a deadline to outlay funds, the overall target of 70 percent was reached -- barely -- by the end of September. That's only faster than expected if you expected the government to fail. Obama makes a valid point about this being a good time to get deals on infrastructure projects. The recession has created desperate workers willing to work cheaper, and the cost of materials is still relatively low. Obama's point that this was borne out by the stimulus projects is on target.

pomt-09107	"Rob Teilhet, Just another career politician."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/21/ken-hodges/campaigns-duel-over-career-politician-attack/	We know the public has never had much of a love affair with politicians. This year seems to be no exception, and the candidates running for office know it. One example was an ad shipped by mail from the campaign of Ken Hodges, a Democrat running for Georgia attorney general. "Rob Teilhet," the advertisement reads. "Just another career politician." The Hodges campaign says it can easily back up its claim. Teilhet, they say, first ran for political office two years after he graduated from law school. Teilhet, a Cobb County Democrat, has been a state representative for eight years and now wants to be attorney general. "We call Teilhet a politician because he is one," Hodges campaign manager Shannon Marietta wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Georgia. After reviewing a similar claim in a Republican Party campaign, PolitiFact Georgia was eager to dig into the merits of this Democrat-on-Democrat attack. The Hodges campaign has its facts right about Teilhet's background. In 2002, two years after Teilhet graduated from law school, he made his first bid for public office. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about Teilhet and a wave of other young faces coming to the Georgia Capitol in 2003. "I assumed I would be the young gun in Cobb," he said. "Seeing two other elected officials even younger, I feel like I'm just another old, white guy." Teilhet was 28 at the time. He's now 36, with eight years in the Legislature. Teilhet is a workers' compensation attorney. His campaign manager Rebecca DeHart notes it's a full-time job, as opposed to Teilhet's time at the Legislature, which has 40 meeting days a year. The Hodges campaign suggests Teilhet isn't doing much work outside the Capitol. They could find only 19 cases he's been involved with in the past 10 years. The Teilhet campaign countered he works about 40 cases a year. Hodges, 44, has served as Dougherty County district attorney for the past 12 years. He's been re-elected twice. The Teilhet camp says it's hard to call someone a "career politician" when you've been in office longer than the other candidate. Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie agrees. "If you are going to throw a punch, it is going to come back at you in some shape or form," she said. "It's the pot calling the kettle black." Marietta contends that being a district attorney is less political than being a state lawmaker. Gillespie believes there's still politics involved with campaigning for and serving as district attorney. Teilhet has been involved in politics basically since he graduated law school. He is certainly a young man in a hurry, and one with major political ambitions. But some political experts believe his eight years in the Legislature does not qualify Teilhet for the title "career politician." Some, like Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint, say Hodges should not make such accusations, based on his 12 years in office. "They might not have thought this through," he said. We rate this attack as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Ken Hodges	None	None	None	2010-06-21T06:00:00	2010-06-11	['None']
pomt-01149	Texas House Speaker Joe Straus said, ‘I do not care if Wallace Hall swings from a tree.’	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/dec/17/wallace-hall/regent-wallace-hall-joe-straus-string-from-tree/	According to a University of Texas System regent who’s under criminal investigation, the Republican speaker of the Texas House indicated he didn’t care if the regent got strung up. Dallas businessman Wallace L. Hall Jr. made his biggest splash in a Dec. 6, 2014, speech accepting the Torch of Freedom award from Texans for Fiscal Responsibility by saying the House speaker, Joe Straus, separately told Gov. Rick Perry, who appointed Hall to the board, that he would drop the House’s pressure on Hall if Hall just quit the board -- an offer that Straus spokesman Jason Embry subsequently said did not happen. Our attention was drawn by another part of Hall’s speech. After saying his own questions about "unusual admissions" practices at UT led to a special House committee’s impeachment proceedings, Hall added: "And this quote from the speaker of the House before a large audience: ‘I do not care if Wallace Hall swings from a tree.’ This from the same speaker who claims his job is not to protect the citizens, but his (House) members. "Of course, he did not attempt to confront me personally," Hall said. "Does that seem odd to you? Instead he set up an experimental investigative committee to force me to quit and, failing that, destroy my reputation." Hall said he also was threatened with investigations by the Department of Public Safety and FBI and is waiting, like his wife and children, to see if he’s indicted in Travis County. That tree-swinging mention struck us as provocative enough to verify. Hall offered no comment in response to our emailed inquiries nor did Straus engage. Straus interviewed in 2013 From an online search, though, we learned that Straus talked about Hall and a tree in a public interview during the 2013 Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. In the Sept. 28, 2013, interview, Straus described his expectations of a special House panel formed to consider leveling impeachment charges against Hall. In August 2014, that panel censured and admonished Hall, listing his relentless demands for records from UT-Austin, his handling of confidential student records and his efforts to oust the university’s president, Bill Powers, who later announced his plans to step down. Hall’s defenders, including Perry, say he has simply exercised his oversight duties as a regent. As of mid-December 2014, Hall remained under investigation by the Travis County district attorney’s Public Integrity Unit, in part for his handling of confidential student information. Straus said in the 2013 interview: "I want a fair, thorough, complete investigation. ...Wherever the trail leads, that’s where we’ll go." Our transcript picks up with Tribune reporter Jay Root: ROOT: "What have you heard about the allegations against Wallace Hall that either just don’t disturb you, that think that it’s even appropriate to even be talking about?..." STRAUS: "I don’t know. I don’t want to prejudge what the committee and the investigation is going to turn up. And I don’t, I don’t want to say I don’t care. But I have, I have no bias here. I don’t, I don’t care whether they, whether they give the guy a medal of honor or hang him from a tree. I don’t know, I don’t know, I have no idea. ROOT: "Hang him from a tree, really?" (crowd laughter) STRAUS: "Well, you know, not literally. But my point is whether the report is harshly critical and leads to some impeachable offense and makes that recommendation or whether it says Wallace Hall is the greatest... regent that’s ever been in the history of Texas, hands off, give him some kind of resolution in his honor. I don’t know. And I’m not gonna know until the investigation is complete." Our ruling According to Hall, Straus said, "I do not care if Wallace Hall swings from a tree." Straus said close to that, but he said in the same breath he’d likewise be open to a special panel deciding Hall deserved to be honored. Overall, the speaker made it clear he wasn’t judging Hall in advance of the committee’s review -- which is hardly how Hall characterized Straus' attitude. With all this detail available in the online video of the Straus interview, Hall’s statement shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-00781	"Iran’s defense budget is $30 billion. Our defense budget is closer to $600 billion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/09/barack-obama/obama-iran-spends-30-billion-defense-us-about-600-/	As President Barack Obama tries to win support for a nuclear deal with Iran, one of his arguments is that this strategy of negotiation comes with minimal risk. In an interview with the New York Times, Obama made the point that America is and will remain much more powerful than Iran. "Iran’s defense budget is $30 billion. Our defense budget is closer to $600 billion," Obama said. "Iran understands that they cannot fight us." As part of the promise we made during our Kickstarter campaign, we gave a reader the chance to pick from a list of possible claims, and the reader asked us to look into Obama’s comparison of the Iranian and U.S. military budgets. We asked the White House for the source of the president’s statement. The press office staff was checking but as of the time we published, we had not heard back. Iran Iran has about 500,000 people in its military, including many conscripts with limited training and some elite forces. According to the U.S. Defense Department’s annual review of Iran, "Iran’s military doctrine is defensive. It is designed to deter an attack, survive an initial strike, retaliate against an aggressor, and force a diplomatic solution to hostilities while avoiding any concessions that challenge its core interests." A summary from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analytic branch of Congress, says "Iran lacks the logistical ability to deploy its own ground forces across waterways such as the Persian Gulf, but Iran is able to project power throughout the region by recruiting, advising, and arming Shiite fighters from around the region as a force multiplier." The reports adds that Iran "is developing increasingly lethal systems such as more advanced naval mines, submarines, coastal defense and anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles, and attack craft." We found several estimates of Iran’s military spending. The Congressional Research Service said the country spends about 3 percent of its GDP, which translates into about $11 billion. Reuters reported that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani plans to spend 282 trillion rials on defense. At the current exchange rate, that equals about $10 billion. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database has a similar figure. Long-time Middle East analyst Anthony Cordesman with the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote that after accounting for Iran’s support for its defense industry, the money it spends on Shiite paramilitary groups in other countries, and its nuclear program, the total could reach $14 billion. The highest estimate we found came from the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation, a Washington think tank and advocacy group. It put Iran’s total spending at $17.7 billion in 2013. U.S. military spending Most of the military budget falls under the Defense Department. The actual total includes portions of the country’s nuclear program at the Energy Department and defense-related spending in other departments. For the Defense Department alone, the Congressional Budget Office’s summary of the budget bill passed last December shows $520 billion in outlays with another $64 billion (good for two years) to cover overseas contingency operations, such as fighting the Islamic State group. That yields a total of $584 billion. Laicie Heeley is policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation. By Heeley’s tally, after you add in $19 billion for nuclear weapons and $7.5 billion in other departments, the total comes to $621 billion. For fiscal year 2016, the president is requesting nearly $612 billion. "It's hovered around the $600 billion for the past two years and hit almost $700 billion in FY12," Heeley said. Our ruling Obama said that "Iran’s defense budget is $30 billion. Our defense budget is closer to $600 billion." The highest estimate we found for Iran’s total defense spending was $18 billion. That is significantly less than Obama said, although if anything, it supports his argument more than the number he used. Obama gave himself some wiggle room on American defense spending. It is actually a bit higher than $600 billion but his phrasing is pretty close. With the caveat that Obama overstated Iran’s military spending, we rate the claim Mostly True. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union. Thanks to all who contributed.

pomt-01679	Sen. Jack Reed "cast the deciding vote in the Senate for the Affordable Care Act."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/aug/17/mark-zaccaria/mark-zaccaria-says-sen-jack-reed-cast-deciding-vot/	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, remains part of the great divide that separates most Republicans and Democrats. So it's not surprising that Mark Zaccaria, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, would raise the issue during his Aug. 3 interview on WJAR-TV's "10 News Conference." He put the blame for the law's passage squarely on the shoulders of incumbent Democrat Jack Reed. "Let's talk about the Affordable Care Act," Zaccaria said. "Mr. Reed cast the deciding vote in the Senate for the Affordable Care Act and what we are seeing is that more people today associate that with the ineptitude in management that we've seen in the Veterans Administration than in any kind of a private health insurance plan that they may have had prior to this time." We know Reed voted for the ACA, as did all of the Rhode Island delegation at the time. But was Reed really the deciding vote? PolitiFact has been down this road before. A quick search of PolitiFact rulings shows that Democratic Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Bill Nelson of Florida, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Sherrod Brown of Ohio have been blamed by various Republicans and conservative groups for casting the deciding vote on Obamacare. In each case, PolitiFact has ruled the claims Mostly False or False, depending on their wording and context. The reason: A deciding vote is typically the one vote -- sometimes cast at the last minute -- that puts a proposal over the top. To use a sports analogy, the deciding goal in a 3-2 soccer match is never the first two goals, even though all three are crucial to the win. The key Senate vote in the Obamacare debate -- actually the Senate's vote to close debate that paved the way for passage -- needed no fewer than 60 Senators supporting the proposal. That's all it got. Some senators withheld their support until the end, looking for last-minute modifications; Reed did not. He was the 45th "aye" vote during the roll-call. When we emailed Zaccaria's campaign to ask what made Reed's vote the deciding vote, the candidate noted that the vote to end debate got the bare-minimum of 60 votes, including Reed's. "Without Mr. Reed’s vote to end debate, the Senate could have filibustered longer or even changed or defeated the measure," Zaccaria said. "My point is that Sen. Reed had personal control over the passage of the ACA and, knowing the impact it would have, voted Yes," he said. "I don’t believe my point regarding Mr. Reed is diminished simply because every other Democrat Senator also had that same power." Our ruling Mark Zaccaria said that Sen. Jack Reed "cast the deciding vote in the Senate for the Affordable Care Act." Zaccaria's position is that because every "yea" vote in the motion to end debate on the act was crucial to passage, each of those votes -- 60 in all -- was the deciding vote. Reed's vote was crucial. Zaccaria could have called it "a" deciding vote (of which there can be many) but there is no evidence that his was "the" deciding vote (of which there is one). Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts -- in this case, the 59 other yes votes, including the 15 "ayes" that came after his -- that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

"Clinton Foundation Cargo Ship Raided At Port Of Baltimore Reveals Sick Secret," read the headline on a May 11, 2017, post on DailyUsaUpdate.com, a site we know traffics in bogus news articles. The secret, according to the story, was that 460 undocumented "refugees from places like Yemen and Syria" were hidden in 14 shipping containers aboard a ship called the Chelsea. The story said some refugees told authorities they had paid $40,000 for passage to the United States. Some of the other containers, the post claimed, carried other contraband, like illegal fruit and several kinds of drugs. The article was flagged by Facebook users, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake posts being shared in news feeds. It has appeared on other sites, as well. The Clinton Foundation was recently the subject of fake news posts that falsely said Chelsea Clinton had been charged with fraud for essentially stealing from the nonprofit, which was shut down. This particular fake story, like so many others, originated at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. This story originally appeared on May 11. TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site’s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately worked to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don’t rely on facts. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. One way to tell if the story is made up, beyond its absurdity, is a link allegedly to a CNN story that is actually to a Forrest Gump meme that reads, "Are you stupid or something?" Just to be sure, we contacted the Clinton Foundation, which said no, they didn’t own or operate any cargo ships. The picture included with the original fake story is a crude Photoshopped image that really is a press photo of the Port of Baltimore. But the port also picked up on this fake story the same day it appeared, tweeting out: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We checked the cargo manifest on this fake news and found the claim didn’t hold water.

pomt-01415	"The states that have raised the minimum wage (this year) have had faster job growth than the states that haven’t raised the minimum wage."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/09/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-states-raised-minimum-wages-have/	President Barack Obama is renewing his call -- stalled by Republican opposition in Congress -- to raise the minimum wage to $10.10. "We should be raising the minimum wage to make sure that more workers who have been working full-time shouldn’t be living in poverty," Obama said in an Oct. 3 speech at a manufacturing plant in Princeton, Ind. He noted that "about 13 states and a bunch of cities around the country have gone ahead and done it without Congress." "When you hear folks saying, well, if you raise the minimum wage that's going to be fewer jobs -- it turns out the states that have raised the minimum wage have had faster job growth than the states that haven’t raised the minimum wage," he added. We wondered whether Obama was correct. The White House told us they were referring to the seasonally adjusted growth of non-farm jobs since December 2013. So we crunched the numbers for state-level employment data, which is collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The comparison involved nine states that increased their minimum wage automatically early in the year to keep pace with inflation (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington) plus four more states that passed new laws to hike the wage (Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island). The other side consisted of 37 states that didn’t boost their minimum wage at all. We calculated the differences between wage-raising states and non-raising states in two ways. One was to simply average the job-growth rates for all states in each category, with each state weighted equally. The other was to determine the combined increase in jobs for all states in a given category; this second method effectively places more weight on what’s happening in larger-population states. Using the first method, we found that job growth over that eight-month period averaged 1.074 percent per state in the wage-raising states, compared to 0.871 percent per state in the non-wage-raising states. This provides support for Obama’s claim, though it’s a pretty small difference -- just two-tenths of one percent. Using the second method -- the one that gives greater weight to high-population states -- we found that job growth over that eight-month period averaged 1.092 percent in the wage-raising states, compared to 1.090 percent in the non-wage-raising states. That’s a higher rate of job growth in the minimum-wage-raising states -- but by the almost comically narrow margin of 2/1,000ths of one percent. So Obama has some very small numerical support for his claim that growth rates over that period are higher in states that raised their wage. But as support goes, economists we interviewed said it’s an awfully thin reed. Here’s why this scale of difference doesn’t mean a whole lot. • Employment figures are "noisy." That means they tend to move around a lot. So economists caution against reading too much into upward or downward movements in these numbers; they may simply be random blips. One way to illustrate this is to use a slightly different time frame. We decided to run the numbers the same way, but started the clock one month later, crunching the data from January 2014 to August 2014. If you make just this one-month switch, the job-creation advantage among wage-raising states simply disappears. The difference in job growth "could just be random chance," said Andrew G. Biggs, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. • The raw data we’re using has built-in margins of error. A related point is that BLS’s job figures may seem precise on the surface, but the agency warns that they are only the best approximation -- there’s a margin of error that has to be taken into account with every figure. For the nation as a whole, the monthly job figures have a margin of error of about 90,000 jobs -- meaning that if the number of jobs is reported to grow nationally by 100,000, the actual amount will very likely be somewhere between 10,000 and 190,000. The widely reported figure of 90,000 is simply the best guess within that range, rather than an absolute. Each state has their own margin of error. This degree of uncertainty becomes particularly important when Obama is relying on such small differences to make his point about the impact of the minimum wage on job growth. When he argues that a difference of two-tenths of a percentage point is enough to hang a talking point on -- much less 2/1,000ths of a percentage point -- it’s important to remember that’s a difference so small it is likely within the margins of error. • Eight months is a short period for drawing conclusions. "I would never draw an inference about employment effects by considering the observed change in employment in just the first six or eight months after its enactment, period," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "I would be flabbergasted if it turned out that the effect over such a short period of time could offer a valid indicator of the impact of minimum-wage hikes on employment. You need more time, and you need to make some kind of rudimentary control for the economic trends in the states that preceded the wage hike." The White House told PolitiFact that there’s precedent for an eight-month window in studying this question, pointing to this widely cited 1994 study on the minimum wage. More broadly, the White House frames Obama’s comment not as proclaiming that minimum-wage hikes cause faster job growth, but as a reaction to critics who argue that minimum-wage hikes inevitably hamper job creation. That is a more defensible point, and it’s true that Obama prefaced his claim by saying, "When you hear folks saying, well, if you raise the minimum wage that's going to be fewer jobs." However, Obama goes on to say that minimum-wage-raising states actually "had faster job growth" -- a stronger statement than just saying that a minimum-wage hike won’t damage job growth. Obama may not have intended to, but it would be reasonable for a listener to the Princeton, Ind., speech to think the president believes that raising the minimum wage affirmatively leads to faster job growth, and then wonder if that’s true. Our ruling Obama said "the states that have raised the minimum wage have had faster job growth than the states that haven’t raised the minimum wage." The White House told us they were referring to the seasonally adjusted growth of non-farm jobs since December 2013. On the numbers, Obama has a point -- at least when using the very specific time frame he chose. But economists say that the numbers are too noisy, the margins of error are too big, and the time frame may be too short to be certain that we’re seeing the effect of a higher minimum wage. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-10-09T11:48:05	2014-10-03	['None']
pomt-07314	Failure to raise the debt limit does not force a U.S. default on debt payments.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/16/randy-forbes/rep-randy-forbes-says-holding-line-debt-limit-does/	If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, the result would surely be an immediate financial Armageddon the likes of which the U.S. has never seen, right? Not so, says Virginia Congressman J. Randy Forbes, R-4th. With the nation expected to reach its $14.294 trillion debt cap as early as today, a decision on the debt ceiling looms large. Unlike previous votes, this one won’t be a formality. Republicans say they won’t approve a hike without a sweeping plan to reduce the debt. Recognizing that consensus will not be reached by today, Forbes has co-sponsored the "Full Faith and Credit Act," which would require the U.S. Treasury to prioritize payments on the public debt over any other payments when we reach the ceiling. In a blog post on his website, Forbes touts his legislation as a safeguard, saying warnings of impending fiscal calamity have been greatly exaggerated. "The most inflammatory rhetoric we’re hearing is the threat that failure to raise the debt limit would automatically cause the U.S. to default on our national debt. This claim, thankfully, is baseless," he said. Is it? We decided to take a look. Although Forbes did not identify who he thinks is guilty of spreading "inflammatory rhetoric," a growing number of House Republicans are accusing U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner of overstating the risk of default if the debt limit is not raised by this summer. Forbes, in his blog post, rolled out the identical argument being used by Geithner’s critics. "Whether or not the debt ceiling is raised, the federal government collects significantly more revenue than it needs to fulfill U.S. debt obligations," Forbes wrote. "If the debt ceiling is reached, the government will still have ten times as much revenue as it needs to make debt payments. The only way the U.S. will immediately default upon reaching the debt ceiling is if the government actively chooses to do so by not making debt payments." Well, if we’re talking about today, Forbes is absolutely right. As it has become clear that consensus will not be reached by today, the U.S. Treasury has said that through various fiscal maneuvers, it can extend until Aug. 2 the deadline before default is even a possibility. OK, but the larger question is, if Congress remains deadlocked in early August, do we default "automatically" then? Well, no. But it wouldn’t be pretty. "What will happen is that we’d have to stop making payments to our seniors — Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security," Geithner recently said in an ABC interview. "We’d have to stop paying veterans’ benefits. We’d have to stop paying all the other payments on all the other things the government does. "And then we would risk default on our interest payments," he added. A Congressional Research Service report backed that up Geithner’s assessment. It said the federal government needs to borrow $738 billion beyond the current statutory limit to finance obligations for the remainder of this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. "To put this into context," the report said, "the federal government would have to eliminate all spending on discretionary programs, cut nearly 70 percent of outlays for mandatory programs, increase revenue collection by nearly two-thirds, or take some combination of those actions in the second half of FY2011 in order to avoid increasing the debt limit. Additional spending cuts and/or revenue increases would be required, under current policy, in FY2012 and beyond to avoid increasing the debt limit." Jim Horney, an analyst with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said taking dire steps to keep up with debt payments would not avert U.S. credit problems. He said the federal government would still likely default on payments for goods and services and benefits to Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries. "There are really serious consequences from us defaulting on any of our legal obligations even if we make interest payments but default on other things," he said. "It would do serious damage to the credibility and credit worthiness of the U.S. government." Horney said reneging on any payments would cause creditors to lose faith in the U.S. to meet all of its obligations and lead to higher interest rates. On the other hand, some conservatives argue that it would simply force the U.S. to start living within its means. "It would be a disaster if we defaulted on our debt. It would be a disaster if we were hit by an asteroid. I think being hit by an asteroid is a more likely scenario," said J.D. Foster, an expert on fiscal policy with the conservative Heritage Foundation. He suggests that Congress look for dramatic spending cuts or offer guidance through legislation on which debts should be paid first to reassure creditors. So let’s look back. Forbes’ claim is that failure to raise the debt ceiling would not "automatically" cause the U.S. to default on its debt. We checked it against two deadlines: first, the May 16 date when we are expected to reach the current debt cap, and then the ominous Aug. 2 date issued by the Treasury. On both, Forbes is right. The Treasury has already said we can reach the max and be OK for a couple months. Beyond Aug. 2, debt payments could continue at the expense of maiming popular government programs. That’s an option. So we rate Forbes’ claim True.	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2011-05-16T07:00:00	2011-05-05	['United_States']

Jamal Raad, Merkley’s spokesman, pointed us to a map by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force that shows Oregon as one of 16 states and Washington, D.C., that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or the expression of gender identification. Five additional states prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, but not on expression. So Merkley is correct about the figures. Raad also clued us into other reports and studies to back up the statement. The Center for American Progress has a state-by-state report that goes even further, identifying 10 additional states with policies prohibiting such behavior in state government or in a part of state government. Those are generally done by executive policy. These policies do not carry the weight of law and do not extend beyond public employees. The federal government also prohibits discrimination against gays and lesbians, as do many Fortune 500 companies. Now the next question: Do gay, lesbian and bisexual workers report employment discrimination at much higher rates than the U.S. average? This was much harder to track down. Raad directed us to a 2005 Gallup Poll, which showed that 15 percent of employed people reported being discriminated against in the previous 12 months. Gallup researchers concluded the actual rate was probably between 9 percent and 15 percent. Among racial/ethnic groups, whites reported the lowest incidence of discrimination, at 12 percent and Asians reported the highest incidence, at 31 percent. But there was no breakout by sexual orientation, leaving us without an apples-to-apples comparison. (Of the types of discrimination, sexual orientation made up for 4 percent of cases, same as religion. Gender accounted for 26 percent of cases.) We turned to Jennifer Pizer, legal director of the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, whose researchers submitted testimony in support of legislation. Pizer said she did not know of a broader study comparing discrimination rates. But her institute relies on several statistics, including a 2008 survey showing that a quarter of lesbian, gay and bisexual respondents reported experiencing job discrimination in the previous five years. A 2007 report of past surveys found that anywhere between 16 percent and 68 percent of LGBT reported experiencing employment discrimination. Again, that’s a fairly broad range and it doesn’t indicate an average of all employees. Perhaps most helpful to us was, Pizer’s colleagues also aggregated state data and found that lesbian, gay and bisexual workers filed anti-discrimination complaints at about the same rate as women, about 5 complaints per every 10,000 employees. Complaints based on race and ethnicity were higher, at 7 per 10,000 workers. Just out of curiosity, we checked with Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian’s office. Spokesman Bob Estabrook said discrimination based on sexual orientation makes up about 2 percent of job and housing complaints. California’s fair employment and housing department shows a similar percentage. But this doesn’t tell us much about rates of job discrimination in general. Where does this leave us? We couldn’t find definitive data showing that gay, lesbian and transgender workers "report employment discrimination and unemployment at much higher rates than the U.S. average." We suspect attitudes toward all minority groups are changing and also, as the workplace becomes more diversified, we expect the U.S. discrimination average to change. We don’t know whether the LGBT community faces more discrimination at work than ethnic groups, women, older people or the disabled. That aside, the studies cited -- and quite frankly, common sense -- suggest that the gay and lesbian population sees its share of discrimination at the workplace. And transgender workers, most likely, see more than their fair share of unemployment and discrimination. And they are not protected under the federal Civil Rights Act. Merkley is correct to say that in more than half the states in the country, there is no law against employers who discriminate based on sexual orientation although employers and government agencies may have their own prohibitions. The statement requires clarification on the scope of protections offered in private and public sector employment. It also requires clarification about what we do know and do not know about job discrimination faced by the general population and other groups. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11141	"Amazon Echo is recording every conversation in a person's home and transmitting it to the cloud."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/31/ro-khanna/your-amazon-alexa-spying-you/	Once the stuff of science fiction, voice-activated virtual assistants like the Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod now reside in millions of American homes, tweaking thermostats, streaming music and scheduling appointments. While some see these devices as helping hands, others view them as Trojan horses in the age of digital surveillance. "It is outrageous that the Amazon Echo is recording every conversation in a person’s home and transmitting it to the cloud," Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., tweeted May 26. "This is exactly why we need an internet bill of rights! Didn’t we fight a revolution to prevent exactly this kind of surveillance?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is Khanna correct about the scope of smart speakers’ electronic eavesdropping? We decided to take a closer look. Does Amazon ‘record every conversation’? Amazon’s voice-controlled Alexa products are considered "always-on" devices — but that doesn’t mean they record customers’ conversations. The devices constantly listen for a user to say a "wake word," which triggers Alexa to begin recording voice data and respond to commands. Wake words include "Alexa," "O.K. Google," and "Hey Siri." The Amazon Echo — one of the online retail giant’s smart speaker product lines — uses seven microphones to listen for its wake word. According to Washington Post tech columnist Geoffrey Fowler, the Echo records a second-long snippet of ambient sound which it "constantly discards and replaces," until a wake word starts the recording process. (Khanna said his claim was based on Fowler's piece.) At least, that’s how it works in theory. In practice, the wake word triggering mechanism has a track record that is far from perfect. In one highly publicized incident, a Portland family’s Alexa captured a private conversation after the voice-controlled device misheard what it thought was the wake word. It later sent the audio recording to someone in Seattle whose number was stored in the family’s contact list. (Khanna’s tweet referenced this story.) Amazon described the chain of events as "an extremely rare occurrence," and issued the following statement: "Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like 'Alexa.' Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a ‘send message’ request. At which point, Alexa said out loud 'To whom?' At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer’s contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, '[contact name], right?' Alexa then interpreted background conversation as 'right.' As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely." The Washington Post’s Fowler, who has an Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod, said his devices go rogue on a regular basis. "At least one of them starts recording, randomly, at least once per week," he wrote. "It happens when they pick up a sound from the TV, or a stray bit of conversation that sounds enough like one of their wake words." False positives aside, technology experts told us it’s against Amazon policy to constantly record customers’ private conversations, as Khanna claimed. "There's no proof or confirmation from Amazon that Echo products record ‘every’ conversation in a person's home," said Tiffany Li, a privacy attorney at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project. "Indeed, Amazon has publicly stated that the Alexa products only record after hearing users say wake words." But Li noted that Amazon has been less-than-forthcoming about the circumstances surrounding its recording practices. "It is possible that more data is being recorded than consumers know or that Amazon is willing to publicly admit," she said. "Amazon is not very transparent on privacy practices related to Alexa/Echo products." (An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on this story, but pointed us to their frequently asked questions page.) Notwithstanding Amazon’s lack of candor, Li said Khanna’s claim is "probably not accurate." When does Amazon send conversations ‘to the cloud’? Only voice data that’s recorded after a wake word is detected is sent to the cloud. So Khanna’s claim creates a false impression that private conversations are being secretly routed to Amazon’s computers. "While the device is indeed always listening (there's no way for it to respond to the wake word otherwise), it is not always transmitting to the cloud," said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a Senior Staff Technologist for the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. Still, Gillmor expressed reservations about the degree of control Amazon maintains over the devices after they’re installed in customers’ homes. "The code in that device is under the control of Amazon, and it's basically up to Amazon (not to the owner of the device) to make sure that it's not transmitting to the cloud," he said. "Clearly, Amazon isn't making those decisions correctly all the time." Our ruling Khanna said, "Amazon Echo is recording every conversation in a person's home and transmitting it to the cloud." Amazon’s Alexa technology is designed to capture voice data only after a specific voice command, called a wake word, triggers a recording mechanism. Despite some instances where private conversations were accidentally recorded and uploaded to the cloud, Khanna’s claim greatly overstates things. We found no evidence to suggest the device records every conversation and sends it the cloud. It does record conversations when it hears the wake word, and in some cases the device has misinterpreted speech when people didn't actually say the wake work. We rate this Mostly False.

pomt-05143	"Women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-women-are-paid-77-cents-dolla/	President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign released a new ad aimed at women on June 21, 2012. Here’s the narration: "The son of a single mom, proud father of two daughters, President Obama knows that women being paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men isn't just unfair, it hurts families. So the first law he signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help ensure that women are paid the same as men for doing the exact same work. Because President Obama knows that fairness for women means a stronger middle class for America." In this item, we're checking the claim that "women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." The 77 cent figure has become a rallying cry for those who seek to eliminate employment discrimination based on gender. And it’s a genuine statistic. In a report released in September 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau wrote that in 2010, the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers was 0.77." Translated into dollars, that means that in 2010, women working full-time earned 77 cents for every dollar earned by men working full time. But the Obama ad takes a solid statistic and describes it incorrectly. The campaign is wrong to say that the 77-cent figure describes the pay differences between men and women "doing the same work." (By contrast, former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine recently earned a Mostly True on a similar claim because he was not specifying the number was for the same occupations.) The 77-cent figure compares all male and female workers, regardless of their occupation. Whether due to a historical legacy of discrimination or because of personal choice, women and men are disproportionately represented in certain jobs. For instance, women dominate the ranks of receptionists, nurses, and elementary and middle-school teachers, among other fields. Men are disproportionately truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers. "If more men tend to be employed in occupations that pay higher wages both to men and women, then men may enjoy an overall earnings advantage even if all women in each occupation receive exactly the same hourly pay as the men who are employed in the occupation," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Indeed, if you look at men and women working in the same professions, the pay gap is much smaller (though for most professions, it doesn’t disappear entirely). For computer programmers, for instance, women earn 95 cents for every dollar a man earns. For cashiers it’s 92 cents. For cooks and customer service representatives, it’s 95 cents. Other occupations have more unequal ratios. Women who are personal financial advisers, for instance, earn just 58 cents of what men in that job earn. (The statistics come from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a think tank focusing on women’s issues.) There are at least two other factors that weaken the accuracy of the ad’s claim. One involves hours worked. While calculations that led to the 77-cent figure did not include any part-time workers, the label "full time worker" can actually be applied to employees with a wide range of hours worked per week. The official Bureau of Labor Statistics definition of a full-time worker is someone who works at least 35 hours per week. Someone who gets no vacation time and works 40 hours a week for 52 weeks would work 2,080 hours in a year. By contrast, a worker on a 36-hour-per-week schedule who has two weeks off would work only 1,800 hours. Meanwhile, a worker with two weeks off who averaged four hours per week of overtime would end up with 2,200 hours. "Some workers have even longer work schedules than that, especially when the economy is expanding rapidly," Burtless said. "So even among full-time, year-round workers, there is considerable variability in annual work hours." This variation can work its way into the gender pay gap if women seek more flexible schedules or if men happen to fill jobs with greater opportunities for overtime. (PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) The other complicating factor involves seniority on the job. Men have typically held their jobs longer than women in the same position. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, men in 2010 who were between 45 and 54 years old had a median job tenure of 8.5 years, compared to 7.1 years for women in the same age group. "Women have shorter job tenures than men because they have more work interruptions than men, usually because they have children and assume heavy responsibility for rearing those children," Burtless said. Improving access to child care or offering stronger protections for workers who leave the workforce temporarily to raise children, as some other advanced industrialized nations do, would probably decrease the wage gap, Burtless said. When we contacted the Obama campaign, they reiterated the importance of the overall figures and noted a Bloomberg analysis that showed that only one occupation out of 265 with more than 10,000 men and women employed did women out-earn men -- namely, "personal care and service workers, which include butlers, valets, house sitters and shoe shiners." "No matter how you look at it, women make less than men -- at the same job, at different jobs, weekly, annually and by occupation," said Kara Carscaden, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign. Nothing in our analysis suggests that gender discrimination doesn’t exist. In fact, the experts we consulted agreed that no matter how much you adjust the models to equalize for outside factors, a difference in pay between men and women remains, and it’s one that can’t be explained away. Still, those same experts also agreed that ad goes too far in claiming that the 77-cent statistic describes the pay gap for women "doing the same work as men." "Sexism may explain differences in occupation, industry, education, hours and weeks worked, so it’s hard to know how much of the gap is due to discrimination. But (77 cents) isn’t the right statistic for saying ‘the same work as,’" said Betsey Stevenson, a business and public policy professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and visiting economics professor at Princeton University who previously served as chief economist for Obama’s labor secretary. Burtless agreed. "It’s hard to defend the last seven words in the ad’s claim." Our ruling The Obama campaign took a legitimate statistic and described it in a way that makes it sound much more dramatic than it actually is. The 77-cent figure is real, but it does not factor in occupations held, hours worked or length of tenure. Describing that statistic as referring to the pay for women "doing the same work as men" earns it a rating of Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-06-21T17:43:27	2012-06-21	['None']
pomt-08846	Says the United States is the only nation that affords citizenship to anyone born here, "whether you are here legally or illegally."	false	/texas/statements/2010/aug/10/john-carter/rep-john-carter-says-united-states-only-nation-aff/	U.S. Rep. John Carter told reporters Monday he's sympathetic to concerns simmering in some circles over the first part of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which holds that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens." At issue: Whether providing citizenship for being born on U.S. soil makes sense amid turmoil over illegal immigration. In Monday’s conference call, organized by the Republican National Committee to generate heat over President Barack Obama's in-and-out visit to Texas, Carter went on to say the United States "may be, or probably (is) the only nation in the world that has a provision where if you are born in our country, no matter whether you are here legally or illegally, you are still considered a United States citizen." Asked about his comment a moment later, Carter didn't hedge; he said he thinks it's correct that "we are the only country in the world that affords citizenship" to children born to parents illegally in the country when their child is born here. If so, Carter, R-Round Rock, thinks wrong — as PolitiFact National concluded about a similar June 2009 statement by conservative pundit Glenn Beck, rating False Beck's statement that we're the only country in the world that has automatic citizenship for individuals born here. Citing a list posted online by NumbersUSA, a group that favors reducing immigration into the United States, PolitiFact wrote: "We might be inclined to cut Beck some slack if the only other countries were Saint Lucia, Antigua and Lesotho. In fact, we'll even admit that we had to look up what continent Lesotho is even on (Africa). But Canada, Brazil, Romania? We didn't have to go looking for those. It might be surprising to Americans that automatic citizenship isn't more common in the developed world, but the bottom line is Beck made a blanket statement that is just wrong." This wrap up our Carter review? Not quite. Bill Riggs, the RNC's spokesman, telephoned after Monday's call and said Carter means the United States is "one of the few industrialized nations" that afford citizenship for anyone born here. When we reached Carter's communications director, John Stone, he said likewise. Stone followed up with an e-mail stating that 34 nations allow birthright citizenship. "Note the lack of all major Western industrialized nations with the exception of Canada. None of the nations of the European Union (or the countries of) Japan or China recognize birthright citizenship," Stone’s e-mail said. "These facts confirm Congressman's Carter's frequent statement that the United States is one of the few nations that allow birthright citizenship." Stone didn't immediately say how he came up with the list. Separately, we reached Jon Feere, legal policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, which has studied the costs of illegal immigration. Feere said he's completing a report on birthright citizenship including a breakdown of, to this point, 27 nations that grant automatic citizenship to children born to illegal residents. Feere said he built his list based on conversations with foreign government officials. Canada has automatic birthright citizenship, according to Feere's breakdown, while Mexico provides for automatic Mexican "nationality." Latin and South American nations predominate on the list;. they include Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Feere said in an e-mail: "No European country has such a policy. The only advanced economies in the world with birthright citizenship policies are the United States and Canada." He pointed us to the International Monetary Fund's classification of nation's economies as advanced, emerging and developing countries, demonstrating that the only nations with advanced economies that provide for birthright citizenship are Canada and the United States. So, how does Carter's statement come out? As researched by PolitiFact in 2009, Carter's initial statement (which he reaffirmed) that the United States is the only nation that provides citizenship to children born here regardless of their parents' immigration status is incorrect. Yet the RNC’s Riggs quickly amended Carter’s statement to say he means the United States is among a few industrial nations with such a provision; that's accurate. It’s good that the GOP spokesman reeled back on the congressman’s mistake. Still, we rate Carter's initial statement False.

pomt-13105	Says Mike Coffman said two different things: "stop the deportations" in a Spanish-language debate and "you're going to be deported" in an English-language TV interview.	mostly false	/colorado/statements/2016/nov/04/morgan-carroll/morgan-carroll-says-mike-coffman-changes-tune-immi/	Democratic challenger Morgan Carroll's campaign says Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman changes his immigration stance depending on the audience. In a recent news release, Carroll's camp accused Coffman of saying "stop the deportations" while speaking Spanish in the Univision debate on Oct. 4 and then flip-flopping to say "you're going to be deported," while speaking English during a KUSA-TV interview two weeks later. "Mike Coffman can lie in whatever language he wants, but it's clear that Mike Coffman will say or do anythincig to hold on to his job," said Carroll campaign spokesman,Drew Godinich in the release. The dispute captures the bare-knuckle battle for Colorado’s 6th Congressional District, which rings Denver’s eastern suburbs and is one of the most competitive swing districts in the nation. In recent years, Coffman moderated his once-hardline positions on immigration after the district, formerly a conservative bastion, was redrawn in 2012 and became the most politically and ethnically diverse enclave in Colorado. He learned Spanish and has worked to reach out to Hispanic and Muslim constituents and attend Ethiopian community festivals. But Carroll, a state senator, and her Democratic allies have worked just as hard to remind voters that in 2010 Coffman said, "The DREAM Act will be a nightmare for the American people," as he voted against the bill to give children brought into the country unlawfully a path to citizenship if they attended college or served in the military. And they recall that Coffman supported doing away with bilingual ballots in 2011, saying non-English speakers ought to "pull out a dictionary" when they are at home reviewing their mail-in ballots. We looked closer at the claim that a Spanish-speaking Coffman said "stop the deportations" in the Univision debate and then warned undocumented immigrants, "you're going to be deported," while speaking English in a KUSA-TV interview. (Coffman's immigration comments start at 7:09 in the KUSA interview). Coffman has recently made comments on TV programs with English-speaking audiences that we need tougher border security and immigration enforcement and, at some point in the future, undocumented immigrants need to be deported. But Coffman clearly states -- in Spanish and English TV appearances -- that he advocates a "path to permanent residency" for young immigrants who were brought here as children. And for longtime, undocumented adult immigrants who haven't violated criminal laws, he supports a grace period of three-to-six months where they could "come out of the shadows" and gain legalized status that would allow them to live and work here "without fear of deportations." Here's the Carroll campaign's news release translation for Coffman's Spanish comments on immigration (with a section they highlighted in bold): "I think that as a part of an immigration reform, we should create a (period) of time that allows those who have not broken any other law other than immigration laws to come out of the shadows, obtain documentation that allows them to work in our country without fear, to stop the deportations." PolitiFact partner Denver7 checked the Carroll campaign's Spanish translation of Coffman and found a brief but noteworthy error. Coffman said he supported immigration reform that would create a time period for undocumented immigrants who have not broken criminal laws to come out of the shadows and obtain documentation that allows them to work in our country "without fear of deportations." He did not say, "stop the deportations," as the Carroll camp’s translation stated. (Coffman's Spanish comments on immigration begin at 6:55 in the Univision debate) Let's turn to Coffman’s interview in English with KUSA anchor Kyle Clark. As the Carroll campaign noted, when Coffman was asked what should be done with unlawful immigrants in the country, he replied, "I think we need to go to a system...where we have tough enforcement. Where if you're here illegally, you're going to be deported." Yet, Coffman stressed, "My sympathies are really with the children (whose parents are unlawful immigrants). The children that were taken here when they were young, who grew up here, who really know no other country but the United States." He talked about how he's worked to help these young people by introducing legislation, including a 2013 bill, the Military Enlistment Opportunity Act, which sought to provide immigrant children an opportunity to serve in the U.S. military and gain a path to citizenship. On Univision and KUSA, Coffman said he supports giving these young immigrants a path to permanent residency and citizenship based on their education, work history or military service -- which sounds similar to the DREAM Act he once voted against. What about unlawful adult immigrants? "I think for the adults, what I would like to see is to give them a period of time to come out of the shadows (and) as long as they haven't violated criminal laws, to give them a legalized status that would allow them to work here without fear of deportation," he told KUSA. This echoes Coffman's Spanish debate comments where he proposed a grace period where noncriminal adult immigrants could "obtain documentation that allows them to work in our country without fear of deportations." Coffman also makes clear that the window for granting legal status to undocumented immigration must eventually close. Asked about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's "mass deportation plan" at a recent KUSA debate, Coffman said, "I think that's the system we ought to move to." Once his proposed grace period ends, Coffman said: "I would like to see us move to a much tougher system after that point in time. We have to get control of our borders." Coffman campaign spokeswoman Cinamon Watson said his opponents continue to mischaracterize his support for immigration reform. She cited news coverage of how the congressman has clashed with fellow Republican lawmakers and earned praise from some Democrats on reform. Our ruling The Carroll campaign says Coffman said "stop the deportations" while speaking Spanish in a Univision debate and then shifted to saying "you're going to be deported," while speaking English during a KUSA interview. Technically, Coffman said in Spanish that he supported reform that would allow noncriminal adult immigrants to obtain documentation to work in the United States "without fear of deportations" -- not "stop the deportations," as the Carroll camp’s translation stated. The Carroll campaign is correct that Coffman said, "If you're here illegally, you're going to be deported" during the KUSA interview. But he also backed off that hardline position and emphasized his support for providing legal status to noncriminal adult immigrants and young people who were brought here as children who have lived here for years. Carroll can accuse Coffman of trying to be all things to all people, but her news release left out that he maintained -- in Spanish and English -- his reform goal of ensuring that noncriminal immigrants have an opportunity to live and work here "without fear of deportations." We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eab32659-925c-4ea3-95fe-1509c024411f	None	Morgan Carroll	None	None	None	2016-11-04T16:49:32	2016-10-20	['None']
pomt-06606	"We're bankrupt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/22/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-us-bankrupt/	At the Sept. 22, 2011 Fox News-Google Republican presidential candidates debate in Orlando, Fla., former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson was asked about U.S.-Cuba policy, but his reply somehow morphed into a frequent subject of Truth-O-Meter rulings: whether the U.S. is bankrupt.. Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked, "Gov. Johnson, here in Florida, charter flights from Ft. Lauderdale to Havana, Cuba, have resumed. Is there a problem with that? And what are your thoughts on U.S.-Cuba policy? Johnson responded, "I think the biggest threat to our national security is the fact that we're bankrupt," Johnson said. "So I am promising to submit a balanced budget to Congress in the year 2013, and included in that is a 43 percent reduction in military spending." Bankrupt? PolitiFact has examined that claim several times, most recently when Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, said it at a debate in Iowa on Aug. 11, 2011. (Oddly, Baier asked the question that time, too.) We rated it False, and we haven’t changed our minds. Here, as before, we’re relying on common definitions of "bankrupt" that seem to best fit the context of Paul's statement. One is "declared in law unable to pay outstanding debts." Another is "reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished." Since the U.S. government hasn't landed in bankruptcy court and been declared unable to pay its bills, we'll simplify it to whether the United States can pay its debts. Ratings agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch pay attention to this very question. They offer sovereign credit ratings based on the same standards as your credit score: What's the risk a nation might default on its debt by failing to pay its bills? And S&P did downgrade the country's credit rating on Aug. 5, 2011. But what does that mean, exactly? The United States had a AAA credit rating, which S&P defines as having "extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments." It's the highest rating you can get. After the downgrade, the United States has a AA+ credit rating. It's just one notch down from AAA on a scale that has more than 20 notches. S&P now says the United States "has very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments." The "+" shows that the U.S. rating is on the high side of AA. Meanwhile, two other ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, didn't change their U.S. ratings — America still has the highest rating they offer. Fitch Ratings said on Aug. 2, 2011, that "despite the heated political debate ... corporate sector balance sheets and profitability are healthy, underlying productivity growth is still relatively strong, and the U.S. dollar remains unchallenged as the global reserve currency." We'll note that the ratings are forward-looking -- they evaluate whether the United States is likely to default in the future. But Johnson, like Paul, went further than that, saying that "we’re bankrupt" – in the present tense. When we fact-checked Paul’s comment a few weeks ago, we asked the U.S. Treasury: Can the country pay its bills right now? Yes, said spokesman Matt Anderson. "Because Congress acted to prevent a default crisis, the government has been able to meet its financial obligations," he said. Meanwhile, he pointed out that the Bureau of Public Debt has had no trouble selling bills, notes and bonds to finance the public debt. (We should also note that in addition to using taxes, layoffs, spending cuts and debt shifting to fund its obligations, the federal government as sovereign nation could just print more money, though there are downsides to that approach.) Now, about that second definition, "reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished." Allow us an analogy: Your paycheck doesn't cover your bills every month. But you have a great credit score, use your credit card to cover the difference and have no trouble paying your credit card bill. Would you describe yourself as "bankrupt" or "impoverished"? We wouldn't. We'd reserve that description for the neighbor who was behind on his mortgage and couldn't pay his creditors. Johnson said that "we’re bankrupt."

pomt-06867	Under last year’s health care reform, "a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/02/phil-gingrey/gingrey-claims-federal-health-care-board-can-decid/	U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, who’s also a doctor, is aiming his scalpel at a lesser-known provision of last year’s health care overhaul. The Marietta Republican recommends swift removal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which was created to rein in growing Medicare costs. Gingrey, an obstetrician-gynecologist, wants the board repealed. He said at a recent news conference it’s worse than tossing Granny off Stone Mountain. "Democrats like to picture us as pushing Grandmother over the cliff or throwing someone under the bus. In either one of those scenarios, at least the senior has a chance to survive," Gingrey said June 22. "But under this IPAB we described that the Democrats put in Obamacare, where a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy, I guarantee you, when you withdraw that, the patient is going to die," said Gingrey. "It’s rationing." What a bleak prognosis. Under the IPAB, does "a bunch of bureaucrats" really "decide whether you get care"? PolitiFact Georgia asked a Gingrey spokeswoman for proof, but she did not provide any. We turned to four health care policy experts with differing opinions on the IPAB. They all told us that Gingrey was wrong. But before we explain their reasoning, here’s more about the Independent Payment Advisory Board. Lawmakers created the board in response to criticism that Congress has been unable to make the politically risky and technically complex decisions needed to slow the growth of costs for Medicare, the federal program that provides health care for seniors. Under the health care reform bill, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed certain targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow the increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendation within a set time frame, it is automatically implemented. Both sides of the aisle have their problems with the board. Some worry it will be too hard for Congress to overrule IPAB recommendations, or that the board will stifle innovation. In recent months, Republicans such as Gingrey and even Democrats have signed on to repeal the board. This brings us back to Gingrey’s claim that under the IPAB, "a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy." Gingrey is "not even close to correct," said Michael Tanner, a scholar with the libertarian Cato Institute. He opposes the IPAB. "It [IPAB] has nothing to do with individual care at all. It’s not making decisions on individuals," Tanner said. Experts agree that the IPAB has no say in whether a specific person receives dialysis, chemotherapy or any other such treatment. The board does not intercede in individual patient cases. It makes broad policy decisions that affect Medicare’s overall cost. Furthermore, the IPAB is barred from making policy recommendations that would block patients from receiving needed care, experts told PolitiFact Georgia. "The legislation explicitly forbids the board from rationing care," said Stuart Guterman, a health policy expert with the Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan group which works to improve health care access, quality and efficiency. Guterman said he thinks the IPAB can help with health care savings. Our analysis of the bill only found language designed to avoid the result Gingrey foretells. For instance, the IPAB may not submit "any recommendation to ration health care," Section 3403 states. The same section also bars raising premiums for Medicare beneficiaries, as well as increasing deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue, either. The IPAB can reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmissions, or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives for giving chemotherapy to a Medicare patient, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing. If Medicare reimbursements for chemotherapy drop too low, doctors might stop treating Medicare patients, or avoid recommending chemotherapy. But this is not the scenario that Gingrey describes. Gingrey makes no mention of indirect or long-term consequences. He says that with the IPAB, "a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy. I guarantee you, when you withdraw that, the patient is going to die." In other words, Gingrey says that bureaucrats will have the power to deny you treatment. And because of the bureaucrats, you could die. This claim is incorrect. The IPAB does not have anything close to the power that Gingrey suggests. It cannot raise costs to Medicare recipients, much less kill them off by denying lifesaving care. The claim is also outrageous. A policy board is not deadlier than pushing Grandma off a cliff. We diagnose Dr. Gingrey with a not-quite-fatal case of False.	None	Phil Gingrey	None	None	None	2011-08-02T06:00:00	2011-06-22	['None']
pomt-12712	"Florida is now the only state in the nation to tax commercial leases."	true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/08/rick-scott/florida-only-place-state-nation-tax-commercial-lea/	At his State of the State address, Gov. Rick Scott once again promised to cut the state's tax on commercial leases, something he says is unique only to Florida. "Florida is now the only state in the nation to tax commercial leases," Scott said March 7. Florida does levy a 6 percent sales tax on the total rent paid for any commercial property, including storefronts, offices and warehouses. But is that the only state-level tax of its kind? Scott’s team sent over an October 2015 report from Florida TaxWatch, a group that takes a critical look at state spending with an eye toward long-term savings. The report says that Florida "is the only state to impose a standard, statewide sales tax on commercial real estate leases." It cites as evidence a Nov. 24, 2014, research memorandum from the Florida Legislature’s Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, which is nonpartisan. The OPPAGA memo concluded that Florida is the only state that imposes a sales tax on commercial real estate leases. "In 45 states, there is either no sales and use tax or state law applies only to tangible personal property," it reads. The OPPAGA report details a few other places with similar instances of limited taxation of commercial rents. For example, New York City imposes a 6 percent tax on commercial real estate leases, but it only applies to companies that pay at least $250,000 in rent every year. Hawaii imposes a 4 percent general excise tax on income, which can include income from rentals. New Mexico has a gross receipts tax that varies from 5.125 percent to 8.9 percent depending on the location. Commercial rents are included in gross receipts but a deduction for those leases is allowed, effectively eliminating the tax, the report says. And then there’s Arizona, which has no state tax on rent, but does have five cities that impose a particular tax on commercial real estate leases. Still, those laws don’t change the fact Florida is still the only state with a specific sales tax on commercial leases, said Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of research. National experts at the Tax Policy Center said to the best of their knowledge Scott was correct. So did Carla Markowitz, an attorney who specializes in Florida commercial landlord representation speaking on behalf of the Building Owners and Managers Association, or BOMA. In his second term, Scott promised to phase out commercial leases, and has made attempts to do so as far back as 2014. Most recently, in his 2017-18 recommended budget, Scott proposed to reduce the tax on commercial leases by 25 percent, which his office says will cut off $454 million in the state sales tax levied on commercial leases. Our ruling Scott said that "Florida is now the only state in the nation to tax commercial leases." Scott's claim is rooted in a research memo that said Florida is the only state to have a sales tax on commercial leases. The report noted that other states and municipalities have similar taxes, but none of them are comprehensive sales taxes like Florida’s. We rate Scott’s statement True.

pomt-06316	Georgia has had ʺmore bank failures than any other state.ʺ	true	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/14/lynn-westmoreland/georgia-leads-nation-unfortunate-category-lawmaker/	U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland has made a sobering observation about his home state of Georgia in town hall meetings and to others who’ll listen. Georgia has had "more bank failures than any other state," the Republican from Coweta County said at a GOP breakfast meeting in Newnan. Coweta County lost all three of its banks, The Times-Herald of Newnan reported. Westmoreland believes the federal government should not have adopted the bailout plan in 2008 for some of the nation’s largest banks. The congressman believes the government should have let some of them fail and provided more support for community banks. "These are community banks that have been around for 100 years," Westmoreland was quoted by the newspaper as saying. "We're talking generational wealth. We're talking about people losing their savings, their retirement, funds for the education of their children. All of that has gone down the drain." The housing foreclosure crisis in Georgia has been well-documented. It began in some metro Atlanta counties about a decade ago and became a statewide problem as the impact of the Great Recession took hold in 2008. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the congressman was right about a similar economic impact on banks here in Georgia. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. keeps track of bank failures by state. Since Westmoreland’s statement wasn’t specific about what time frame he was talking about, we crunched the numbers for several years. Georgia had 19 bank failures this year when Westmoreland made his statement. That was more than any other state, according to the FDIC. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported a 23rd bank failure, Community Bank of Rockmart, in its Nov. 10 editions. Florida is second with 11 bank failures. Illinois is a distant third with seven bank failures. Next, we went back to 2008, when the recession was at its worst and the bank bailout plan was adopted, and we counted how many bank failures there have been since then. Again, Georgia was first with 70 bank failures, according to the most recent FDIC data. And again, Florida was second with 56 bank failures. If only it was like this in college football, Georgia fans might say. We also decided to examine how many bank failures there have been in each state since 2006. Five years seemed like a good time span to examine bank failures. Once again, Georgia was first with a total of 71 bank failures since then. So what’s the problem in Georgia? Many community banks invested heavily in the real estate market during the boom years of the early 2000s. When the economy stumbled, so did those banks because the loans weren’t being paid. Most of Georgia's failures came after the banks crossed below a certain threshold for capital after those loan losses, the AJC has reported. The banks in Georgia lost less than Florida and other states such as California. Those failed Georgia banks had fewer assets than those in California, Florida and Illinois. Westmoreland was not talking about the size of those bank failures when he spoke in Coweta County. The congressman said bank failures. Therefore, we rate his statement True.

pomt-03263	Says "the acting chief of the IRS said he – and the majority of IRS employees – would rather stay with his current" health "plan than switch to Obamacare."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/aug/09/jeb-hensarling/irs-chiefs-words-didnt-reject-obamacare/	In an Aug. 2, 2013, press release forwarded to us by a reader, U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Dallas, objected to the IRS enforcing Obamacare -- a law he claimed the IRS chief said his employees don’t want applied to themselves. That week, Hensarling said, "the acting chief of the IRS said he – and the majority of IRS employees – would rather stay with his current plan than switch to Obamacare." Did the IRS boss say most agency workers would rather not be included in Obamacare? The 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, isn’t a health plan itself. It requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. The act also sets up online marketplaces, which start opening Oct. 1, 2013, where people can shop for health care plans. Starting in 2014, the IRS gets the job of confirming taxpayers have health insurance and assessing a financial penalty if they don’t. One Obamacare provision requires members of Congress and their aides -- even though they already had health insurance through their employer, Uncle Sam -- to get coverage through the online exchanges, though how that will happen is in flux. A bill filed by U.S. Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., would require all federal employees to get coverage through the exchanges. The National Treasury Employees Union -- whose members include about 80,000 of the IRS’ 90,000 employees, according to a June 10, 2013, Bloomberg news story -- has urged its members to oppose Camp’s bill. Hensarling spokeswoman Sarah Rozier told us the congressman’s claim referred to Aug. 1, 2013, testimony by acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel to a House committee, after Werfel was asked by another Texan why IRS union members opposed Camp’s bill. Notably, however, the question posed by U.S. Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Plano, contained an inaccuracy that’s also present in Hensarling’s statement and in a claim by Florida Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio that PolitiFact recently found flawed. Here’s what Werfel was asked, according to CSPAN video: Johnson: Now, Mr. Werfel, last week your employees who are a member of the National Treasury Employees Union sent a form letter for union members to send in to ask they be exempt from the exchanges. Why are your employees trying to exempt themselves from the very law that you’re tasked to enforce? On Aug. 1, 2013, PolitiFact rated as Mostly False Rubio’s claim that the union was "begging to be let out from under this law." The others also cite the existing Obamacare law: Hensarling referred to a "switch to Obamacare" and Johnson said "exempt ... from the very law." But that premise is flawed, because the union is not objecting to Obamacare -- which doesn’t target Americans who already have insurance. In contrast, the union was objecting to the Camp bill, under which federal employees would have their current health plans taken away and then, like other Americans who lack insurance, buy plans through the exchanges. Here’s the IRS chief’s response to Johnson: Werfel: Well, I don’t want to speak for the NTEU, but I’ll offer a perspective as a federal employee myself and a federal employee at the IRS. And that is we have right now, as employees of the government or the IRS, affordable health care coverage. And I think the ACA was designed to provide an option or an alternative for individuals that do not. And all else being equal, I think if you’re an individual who’s satisfied with your health care coverage, you’re probably in a better position to stick with that coverage than go through the change of moving into a different environment and going through that process. So I think, for a federal employee, I think more likely, and I would -- can speak for myself, I’d prefer to stay with the current policy that I’m pleased with rather than go through a change if I don’t need to go through that change. And -- but, if I’m an individual that doesn’t have affordable health care coverage, or I’m unhappy with my coverage, then it’s my understanding the exchanges would offer a competitive alternative to look at, and that might be something someone might want to pursue. But I think the IRS employees as a whole, I think what the NTEU is saying is they’re pleased with their health care coverage, they prefer to stay in their current health care coverage. Boiled down, Werfel said federal employees already have affordable insurance and he thinks the Obamacare law set in motion programs designed for people who don’t. He said that he and IRS union members would prefer to keep their current policies rather than make a change (in context, the change proposed by Camp’s bill). Rozier told us Hensarling accurately summarized Werfel’s comments. Our ruling Hensarling said that "the acting chief of the IRS said he – and the majority of IRS employees – would rather stay with his current plan than switch to Obamacare." Werfel did say that he and other IRS workers would prefer no change in their insurance coverage. But the context for that statement is not as Hensarling suggested. IRS and other federal workers are not objecting to the law known as Obamacare but to proposed legislation designed to take away their current employer-provided insurance and make them buy coverage through exchanges created by Obamacare. We rate Hensarling’s partly accurate claim, which leaves the misimpression that IRS workers are scrambling to get out from under a law that actually applies to the nation’s uninsured, as Half True.

pomt-01329	Says property insurance rates are going up because Rick Scott signed a bill preventing the state from regulating insurance.	false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/24/charlie-crist/scott-signed-bill-preventing-state-regulating-prop/	Candidates in this year’s gubernatorial race have launched so many attacks against each other, it’s hard to keep them all straight. Even the candidates themselves seem to be having problems. During the Oct. 21, 2014, CNN debate in Jacksonville, Democrat Charlie Crist seemed to mix his talking points when it came to insurance rates. "We haven't had a hurricane in eight years and your property insurance rates have gone through the roof. Now why is that? I'll tell you why," he said. "It is because Rick Scott is not letting the department of insurance regulate insurance. He actually signed a bill last year that said that the Department of Insurance Regulation cannot regulate insurance." Because we have a fairly long memory here at PolitiFact Florida, that didn’t sound right to us. Crist’s campaign told us they didn’t want to expound on this any more, so we looked into it ourselves. We found that Crist is actually using two unrelated attacks at once here, so stick with us and we’ll sort this out. Property insurance The first part of this claim notes that property insurance has gone up. This attack has been a linchpin in the Crist campaign, and we’ve rated it Mostly True in the past. The reason has nothing to do with the state’s Office of Insurance Regulation, though (we’ll get to that in a minute). It’s because Scott signed SB 408, a 2011 law that allowed a reduction in overall coverage limits, shortened the window for filing sinkhole and storm-related damage claims, and limited claims for damage caused by sinkholes to primary structures, among other things. But instead of limiting the Office of Insurance Regulation’s power, the law made carriers file requests with the office for rate increases for higher reinsurance costs -- effectively insurance bought by insurance companies -- and capping those requests at 15 percent per year. The law also allowed insurers to pay back some claims at actual cash value -- the cost of the insured dwelling minus depreciation -- instead of replacement value, depending on the policy. Scott’s plan indeed was to reduce the number of policies run by state-run insurer Citizens, and the legislation worked to that end. It reversed a Crist-era trend of more property owners depending on the agency. The law did reduce coverage and it did raise rates, because its intent was for Citizens to become "actuarially sound." This was accomplished through "taking out" policies that were assumed by private companies and charging more in order to balance costs. Now that the reinsurance market has stabilized after spiking following busy hurricane years in 2004 and 2005, Citizens and other companies this year have asked the state if it’s all right to reduce their rates, but many people in Florida are still stuck with high insurance bills and are unable to afford the coverage they need. Health insurance Now, to Crist’s point about the state’s Office of Insurance Regulation being unable to regulate insurance. This goes back to May 2013, when Scott signed SB 1842. That indeed was a bill that suspended Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty’s power to regulate insurance for two years. But it was health insurance, not property insurance. We’ve looked at this one a couple of different ways, too. It was a response to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which said state law had to follow minimum federal guidelines for insurance plans. The federal health law said insurance providers also had to justify unreasonable rate increases, defined as more than 10 percent per year. The GOP-controlled Legislature was so opposed to the law that it said the federal government could regulate health insurance rates instead of the state. The law said insurers still file rate proposals to OIR, but they didn’t need the agency’s approval. The problem is, the federal law doesn’t give Washington the power to regulate rate increases. Instead, it says the federal government will defer to state agencies. It even provided grant money to help state’s get up to snuff -- Scott gave back $1 million the state received for this purpose. The only time D.C. gets involved is if a state’s system doesn’t meet federal standards to review rates, as is the case in Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. Florida’s system is just fine, the Department of Health and Human Services said. That makes Florida the only state that doesn’t regulate rates despite having a qualified review system. For 2015, 14 insurance companies filed plans for rate increases averaging 13.2 percent. Those numbers will likely go down before final rates are set, but the 2013 law prevents McCarty’s agency from doing anything until next year. Our ruling Crist said property insurance rates are up because Scott signed a bill preventing state from regulating insurance. There are actually two bills involved here: One in 2011 concerning property insurance that effectively let rates go up while reducing coverage, and another in 2013 that prevents the state’s regulatory agency from having a say in health insurance rates for two years. Scott signed both those bills, but they are not interchangeable. Crist mixed his talking points here, but the result confuses the issues. We rate the statement False.

pomt-09419	"Under the ruling of the Supreme Court, any lobbyist could go into any legislator and say, if you don't vote our way on this bill, we're going to run a million-dollar campaign against you in your district."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/17/david-axelrod/axelrod-says-supreme-court-ruling-enables-lobbyist/	In his 2010 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama blasted a landmark 5-4 Supreme Court decision that lifted restrictions on campaign spending by corporations. Television cameras in the House chamber showed that Justice Samuel Alito was visibly irked by the president's criticism, prompting a flurry of media coverage. Chief Justice John Roberts gave the controversy new life when he publicly questioned whether Supreme Court justices should attend the address, which Roberts said had "degenerated into a political pep rally." But the controversy seems to have only emboldened the White House to keep up its criticism of the high court's decision. On the March 14, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, David Axelrod, a top White House confidante to the president, took aim once again at the decision. "Under the ruling of the Supreme Court, any lobbyist could go into any legislator and say, 'If you don't vote our way on this bill, we're going to run a million-dollar campaign against you in your district,' " Axelrod said. "And that is a threat to our democracy. It's going to further reduce the voice of the American people, and it's something we have to push back vigorously on." We checked with a variety of legal experts about whether Axelrod was right. Most agreed that his comments were technically accurate but misleading. First, let's review what the Supreme Court said in the case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. The majority of justices overturned previous decisions that prohibited, in the court's words, "corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an ‘electioneering communication' or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate." While corporations are still barred from giving directly to candidates, they are no longer forced to create political action committees, or PACs, in order to spend money on direct electioneering. A corporation, the justices held, may simply spend funds from its own accounts for that purpose. Here are the main concerns we heard from our experts: • What Axelrod said is correct, but it could have happened even before the Citizens United ruling. It's true, as the White House argues, that the Citizens United decision makes it easier for corporations to make the kinds of threats that Axelrod mentions. Now, rather than having to establish a PAC -- which must abide by stringent rules on soliciting donations from employees -- corporations may spend money directly from their own coffers on direct electioneering. That way, they avoid the regulatory hoops required of using a PAC. Also, because of the ruling, corporations may now run ads that "expressly advocate" the election or defeat of candidates. Before Citizens United, they had to word their corporate-funded ads carefully in order to address issues instead of directly urging viewers to "vote for" or "vote against" a particular candidate. And restrictions on the timing of ads are now out the window. However, the specific scenario Axelrod cited – that "any lobbyist could go into any legislator and say, if you don't vote our way on this bill, we're going to run a million-dollar campaign against you in your district" – could have happened before Citizens United, as well. First, several legal experts said they don't believe the Axelrod scenario would have been prohibited by congressional ethics rules or corruption statutes. Second, any corporation with enough resources in its PAC could have threatened to run, and run, "a million-dollar campaign" against a lawmaker in his or her district. It's true that it would have been more complicated to have raised those million dollars using a PAC, but it would have been feasible for a corporation that was big enough and determined enough to do it. Third, lobbyists aren't the only ones who could have made such a threat before (or after) Citizens United. "The Democratic National Committee can say, ‘If you don't vote with us on this bill, we'll support a primary challenge with $1 million in independent expenditures,' " said Bradley A. Smith, a former Federal Election Commission member who now teaches law at Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio. And fourth, privately owned companies – essentially, a wealthy individual – could already run million-dollar campaigns against candidates under existing rules, especially so-called 527 groups (that is, lightly regulated groups named for the section of the tax code they are organized under). It's true that Citizens United further loosens the restrictions on such groups, but they had already been able to run issue advertising campaigns of unlimited size for years. Axelrod's formulation "really misses the point, because it raises concerns that existed before Citizens United," said Rob Kelner, who chairs the election and political law practice group at the law firm Covington and Burling. • There are practical constraints that would make the Axelrod scenario unlikely to happen. "Could that happen?" asks Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in ethics and lobbying law at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Arent Fox. "Yes, and I could win a gold medal in the next Olympic marathon. Would either of those things happen in reality? No. Any lobbyist who was stupid enough to make such a threat would become persona non grata on Capitol Hill in, oh, about an hour after the threat was made." Kappel added that large, publicly traded companies aren't likely to do the kind of advertising newly permissible under Citizens United, since getting directly involved in partisan politics "runs the risk of alienating half of a company's customers and shareholders, not to mention the possibility of consumer boycotts of the company's goods and services." We ran these arguments by the White House, and spokeswoman Katherine Bedingfield said that the White House stands by Axelrod's portrayal. "The Citizens United decision opened the floodgates for special interests and corporations to make unlimited expenditures to influence American elections," she said. "As a result, corporations have significantly more leeway to run ads prior to an election, and they can now target elected officials in ways that were not possible before. They also have vastly more money to spend, with far fewer restrictions on how they spend it, as a result of the decision. That's why the president has called for bipartisan support for legislation to repair the damage done by this unprecedented and troubling decision." The merits of the Citizens United decision are a legitimate topic for debate. But here, we'll stick to the narrower question of whether Axelrod correctly described the law's impact on his scenario. Based on our discussions with experts, we'd characterize the Citizens United decision as something that opens the door to Axelrod's scenario wider than it had been, not a decision that makes the scenario possible for the first time. Axelrod is correct that under Citizens United, making that kind of threat to a lawmaker is possible -- but by implying that Citizens United is what made it possible, his comment is somewhat misleading. We found broad expert agreement that lobbyists had been legally able to make such threats even before the Citizens United ruling was handed down. As a result, we'd argue that Axelrod's example loses some of its relevance and urgency. So we rate Axelrod's statement Half True.

pomt-05217	"It took us four years to balance the budget. Then I gave you four surplus budgets for the first time in more than 70 years, paid $600 billion down on the national debt."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/08/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-touts-fiscal-record-president-during-/	Speaking at a campaign event in New Jersey last week for U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, former President Bill Clinton offered his own "fact check" on deficits and the national debt. Democrats Menendez and President Barack Obama have been criticized for those issues, Clinton said, but Republican administrations over the last 30 years have increased the debt. On his watch, the former Democratic president said he delivered four consecutive surplus budgets and reduced the debt by $600 billion. "It took us four years to balance the budget," Clinton told the crowd at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford. "Then I gave you four surplus budgets for the first time in more than 70 years, paid $600 billion down on the national debt." A video of the June 1 event was posted the following day on YouTube. (In a separate video, Clinton weighs in on whether the horse "I’ll Have Another" could become a Triple Crown winner Saturday at the Belmont Stakes.) PolitiFact New Jersey found that Clinton’s history lesson needs a fact-check of its own. It’s accurate that Clinton delivered the first four consecutive surplus budgets in more than 70 years, but his claim about reducing the national debt is off. One form of debt dropped by nearly $453 billion over those four fiscal years, but the total debt increased by roughly $400 billion. First, let’s talk about those surplus budgets. In each of Clinton’s first four complete fiscal years -- fiscal years 1994 to 1997 -- the nation incurred a deficit, meaning federal spending surpassed revenues. The deficits declined every year, from about $203 billion to nearly $22 billion. But in fiscal year 1998, the country reached a balanced budget for the first time since fiscal year 1969. From fiscal years 1998 to 2001, the nation achieved a surplus each time for a combined total of about $559 billion. The last surplus budget year ended under President George W. Bush, but it began while Clinton was still in office. The last time there were at least four consecutive surplus budgets was the period between fiscal years 1927 and 1930. Now, we’ll discuss debt reduction in the latter half of the Clinton presidency. Since Clinton just referred to the "national debt," we’ll look at both of the commonly cited measures: debt held by the public and total debt. The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public and money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Clinton is somewhat accurate in terms of the debt held by the public, but he’s wrong as far as the total debt. As we said earlier, the combined surpluses over those four fiscal years totaled about $559 billion. But due to various types of factors -- commonly known as "other means of financing" -- the debt held by the public was only reduced by nearly $453 billion. Also, with an increase in the money the government owes itself, the total debt grew by about $400 billion in the same time period. It’s worth noting that Clinton had to work with a Republican-controlled Congress during the fiscal years when there were surplus budgets and the debt held by the public was reduced. Our ruling At a June 1 campaign event, Clinton touted his fiscal record in the final years of his presidency. "Then I gave you four surplus budgets for the first time in more than 70 years, paid $600 billion down on the national debt," Clinton told the crowd. Clinton delivered four consecutive surplus budgets for the first time in more than seven decades, but the former president misstated the level of debt reduction. During those four fiscal years, the debt held by the public dropped by nearly $453 billion, but total debt jumped by about $400 billion. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-13636	"Half of all NC legislative candidates are unopposed because of gerrymandering."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/aug/09/common-cause/common-cause-video-says-half-all-nc-legislative-ra/	Gerrymandering: It’s something most people learned about in grade school but didn’t think much about until recently, when a deluge of court cases challenged the extent to which politicians can pick their constituents instead of the other way around. And now Common Cause, an advocacy group that opposes gerrymandering, says the process is robbing voters of power by creating districts so inclined toward one party or the other that politicians will never face a real challenge. "What if an election was decided before a single vote is cast?" an online Common Cause ad asks, over ominous music. "It’s happening in North Carolina right now. Half of all NC legislative candidates are unopposed because of gerrymandering. Gerrymandering deprives voters of a voice and a choice in our elections. Help us end gerrymandering now." That seemed pretty stunning to us. North Carolina is a swing state in presidential elections, with Barack Obama barely winning here in 2008 and then barely losing in 2012. So are we really supposed to believe that half of all the candidates for the North Carolina General Assembly are running unopposed? We wanted to check not only if that was true, but also if gerrymandering is to blame – or if there’s some other culprit. What is gerrymandering? The practice is named after Elbridge Gerry, a 19th century Massachusetts governor who signed a law redrawing political districts for political gain. A local newspaper said one district looked like a twisting salamander, and ever since then ‘gerrymander’ has stuck. North Carolina has long been literally a textbook example of gerrymandering. The Washington Post analyzed all 435 U.S. House of Representatives districts in 2014 and said North Carolina tied Maryland for the title of most gerrymandered state in the country. "Overall, the North Carolina GOP's efforts paid off handsomely," the Washington Post analysis said. "Based on their statewide vote share you'd expect North Carolina Democrats to hold about seven seats. But they won only four." A federal court recently forced North Carolina to redraw its U.S. House districts since two were too reliant on race. But it’s not just at the federal level in North Carolina that election districts have been overturned. Even local county and school boards have had their redrawn district lines thrown out. Gerrymandering is a bipartisan issue. The districts overturned recently were drawn by Republicans, but North Carolina Democrats also used gerrymandering when they held power. Uncontested races But while courts have ruled on districts at the local and federal levels, the district lines for the N.C. House and N.C. Senate are intact so far. And it’s those districts that the Common Cause video is focused on. Since the districts are all roughly the same size in terms of population, the group is basically saying that half of North Carolinians don’t have a choice whether a Republican or Democrat will represent them in the state legislature. So we crunched the numbers. In the N.C. House, 55 of the 120 seats will be uncontested in November. That’s not half, but it’s very close. In the N.C. Senate, though, the number is lower. Of the 50 Senate races, only 15 have just one candidate. That’s about 30 percent. In total, of the 170 state legislative seats, 70 of them (or 41 percent) were decided in the primaries or even before: Of the Senate’s 15 uncontested candidates, 13 also had no primary opponent. Of the 55 uncontested House candidates, 40 had no primary opponent. Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause’s North Carolina chapter, acknowledged the number was slightly under half. He said there are also a number of races that are contested by candidates who lose by double digits. But we’ll recognize those quixotic efforts and give the candidates credit – they did, after all, at least run a campaign. So while Common Cause missed the mark on the number of uncontested races, it wasn’t too far off. But what about the second part of the claim, that gerrymandering is to blame? A mix of issues There’s no way we could interview the people who decided not to run against these 70 uncontested candidates because, well, we don’t know who they are. But from talking to some political experts and reading academic and legal papers, we found agreement that gerrymandering is to blame for some uncompetitive races. It’s not the only reason. Name recognition or a strong fundraising operation could be why some people aren’t challenged, said UNC-Charlotte political science professor Martha Kropf, a past president of the North Carolina Political Science Association. She said that’s especially true "if you’re looking at someone who’s been in office for a while." That’s arguably the case for people like N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore and N.C. Senate leader Phil Berger – the two most powerful legislators in the state – who both faced no opponent in either the primary or general elections, despite the sometimes controversial nature of legislation they’ve backed. And even someone with ties to Common Cause, Ted Arrington, said it’s not accurate to blame every single vacancy on gerrymandering – although it can certainly have an effect. Arrington is an expert witness on voting rights who has testified in several dozen court cases in the U.S. and Canada. "If all the districts were 50-50 chance of winning by party (registration), there would still be cases where the party failed to find a candidate or the incumbent is just so well-liked no one is going to run against him," said Arrington, a retired political science professor. Arrington is also a former vice chairman of the Mecklenburg County GOP, in which role he helped Republicans win power in the Charlotte area. He said both parties sometimes don’t run candidates for races they think they’ll lose no matter what, since doing so could encourage the other side to turn out in greater numbers – which could affect more competitive races elsewhere in the county or the state. But that strategy alone can’t explain why half the General Assembly races have only one candidate. Arrington said in a "perfect" system he wouldn’t be surprised if one in every five races was uncontested, "but it shouldn’t be half. Not in a presidential election year." Our ruling Common Cause claimed that half of all races for the state legislature will be uncontested this year because of gerrymandering. It’s actually a bit less than half, but not too far off. And experts agree that while gerrymandering isn’t wholly to blame, it does contribute significantly to the high number of uncontested races. We rate this claim Mostly True. The premise is accurate, although it’s slightly exaggerated. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/61ac38d9-04a2-42ec-b98d-2e3aae4b8f4a	None	Common Cause	None	None	None	2016-08-09T19:46:07	2016-07-19	['None']
pomt-04350	Says Romney said "we should ask Pakistan for permission" to take a shot at Osama bin Laden.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/23/barack-obama/obama-claims-romney-said-we-should-ask-pakistan-pe/	In an attempt to portray Mitt Romney as "all over the map" on foreign policy, President Barack Obama said the candidate once argued that the United States "should ask Pakistan for permission" to strike Osama bin Laden. "When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call," Obama said at the debate in Boca Raton, Fla. "But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man. And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him." We’ve previously rated an Obama claim that Romney’s view on killing bin Laden was "it's not worth moving heaven and earth." We found it Half True. While Romney used those words, he also explained that he wanted to see a broader focus against the "worldwide jihadist effort," not just the al-Qaida leader. In this fact-check, we’re asking whether Romney once said "we should ask Pakistan for permission" to strike if bin Laden was in reach. ‘We keep our options quiet’ Obama approved the May 2, 2011, strike that killed the terrorist mastermind in his compound in Pakistan. The secret, unilateral Navy SEALS mission followed through on a 2007 Obama campaign promise: "If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President (Pervez) Musharraf won't act, we will." Obama’s words attracted criticism from his Democratic and Republican opponents at the time — including Romney. The Republican primary candidate told reporters in Iowa in August 2007 that Obama’s comments were "ill-timed and ill-considered." "I do not concur in the words of Barack Obama in a plan to enter an ally of ours, and their country in a manner complete with bombing and so forth. I don’t think those kind of comments help in this effort to draw more friends to our effort. But certainly there is a war being waged by terrorists of different types and nature across the world. And we want, as a civilized world, to participate with other nations in this civilized effort to help those nations reject the extreme within them. That doesn't mean our troops are going to go all over the world." A Romney campaign news release in December 2007 said, "Sen. Obama Recently Suggested Attacking Inside Pakistan Without Pakistani Approval." Romney didn’t explicitly say that he would ask for permission to strike inside the country. Rather, he said he wanted to "participate with other nations," to fight terrorism and criticized Obama for saying he would attack "without Pakistani approval." And there’s a bit more to the story. At the Aug. 5, 2007, Republican debate in Iowa, moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Romney to explain his reaction to Obama’s pledge. "I think Barack Obama is confused as to who are our friends and who are our enemies," Romney said. "... He says he wants to unilaterally go in and potentially bomb a nation which is our friend." Stephanopoulos pushed for details: "But if your CIA director called you and said we have Osama bin Laden in our sights, Musharraf says no. What do you do?" Romney responded: "It's wrong for a person running for the president of the United States to get on TV and say we're going to go into your country unilaterally. "Of course, America always maintains our option to do whatever we think is in the best interest of America. But we don't go out and say, ladies and gentlemen of Germany, if ever there was a problem in your country and we didn't think you were doing the right thing, we reserve the right to come in and get him out. "We don't say those things. We keep our options quiet. We do not go out and say to a nation which is working with us, where we've collaborated and they are our friend, and we're trying to support Musharraf and strengthen him and his nation, that instead that we intend to go in there and potentially bring out a unilateral attack. "Recognize, to win the war on jihad, we have to not only have a strong military on our own and we need a stronger military, we also need to have strong friends around the world and help moderate Muslims reject the extreme. Because ultimately, the only people who can finally defeat these radical Islamic Jihadists are the Muslims themselves." Stephanopoulos clarified: "So ... what I'm hearing is you keep this option on the table, but it was foolish to talk about it in public. Does anybody disagree with that?" A transcript shows former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson speaking up — but not Romney. Our ruling Obama claimed that during the 2008 campaign, Romney said, "we should ask Pakistan for permission" to take out bin Laden. The reality is somewhat more complex. Romney did express a preference for working with the Pakistanis, and he attacked Obama for saying he would strike if Musharraf wouldn’t. But Romney’s clearest objection was to Obama saying the United States would attack inside Pakistan without approval — not to the option itself. "We keep our options quiet," he said. Obama oversimplified Romney’s stance four years ago. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-23T18:29:06	2012-10-22	['Pakistan', 'Osama_bin_Laden']
pomt-13590	Says "Marco Rubio wrote and passed bipartisan legislation allowing the VA to fire negligent workers."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/aug/17/marco-rubio/rubio-says-he-wrote-passed-veteran-affairs-bill/	Marco Rubio is touting his support for veterans in his latest campaign ad ahead of the Aug. 30 primary in the Florida Senate race. The ad opens with snippets from veterans in the Army, Marines and Navy who are backing Rubio for his efforts to help veterans. After a few testimonials, the screen cuts to text that reads, "Marco Rubio wrote and passed bipartisan legislation allowing the VA to fire negligent workers." We wondered if this was correct, so we looked into it. The bill in question Rubio’s campaign cited the VA Management Accountability Act of 2014, which included stipulations that give the VA secretary the ability to fire Senior Executive Service workers if their performance warrants it. The bill (S.2013) was sponsored by Rubio. A related bill passed in the House, but Rubio's bill didn’t go anywhere in the Senate. So we wondered why Rubio said it "passed." Turns out, Rubio’s legislation was included word-for-word in a larger bill known as the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, which was signed into law in August 2014. This law addressed the Veteran’s Health Administration scandal in 2014, in which Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned following outcry that the VA had falsified data in regards to the long wait times veterans were met with when using VA hospitals. This bill passed the Senate 93-3, with four members not voting. It passed in the House 265-160, with six members not voting. One highlight from the law provides for more accountability for negligent senior managers of the law, which includes the ability to remove or demote senior executive officers for misconduct. Rubio had a role in the passage of the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014. News reports provided by his spokeswoman backed this up. A McClatchy DC report in March gave Rubio credit for playing a "vital role" in the final legislation, although the specific overhaul he sponsored did not pass. Another report from CBS Miami mentions that Rubio was asked to be a part of the committee that oversees problems with veteran’s health care: "While he is not a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Rubio was asked to be part of the conference committee due to his work in sponsoring the VA Management Accountability Act of 2014." And finally, Capitol newspaper The Hill said Rubio’s section about firing negligent VA workers was included in the overall bill-turned-law. Our ruling Marco Rubio’s latest ad said he "wrote and passed bipartisan legislation allowing the VA to fire negligent workers." This is fairly accurate, with the one caveat being that his legislation was included in a larger bill, and passed as law with other reforms to the VA system. We rate this Mostly True. Editor's Note: This fact-check was updated Aug. 25, 2016, to clarify House action on a bill related to Rubio's.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-08-17T14:00:00	2016-08-12	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-11561	"Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/06/say-anything-blog/heitkamp-didnt-high-five-schumer-abortion/	A headline on a North Dakota political blog wrongly said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., high-fived Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., following a controversial abortion vote. "Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban," the headline reads. The vote in question was to proceed to a motion that would make nearly all abortions after 20 weeks illegal and subject anyone who performed the procedure to prison time or fines. The 51-46 yea-to-nay vote fell below the filibuster threshold of 60 votes, and Heitkamp’s vote was one of those nays. But did Heitkamp follow up her vote with a celebratory high-five with the Senate minority leader? The main image, a screen grab from C-SPAN, certainly makes it seem that way. But the video, which is embedded in the story, shows more of an awkward greeting than a crude celebration. The footage shows Heitkamp walking into the chamber as she converses with Cory Booker, D-N.J.. She responds to the clerk’s roll call in the negative, and resumes chatting. As they speak, Schumer approaches Booker and Heitkamp, and Heitkamp catches his eye. They each wave hello with their hands up, and Heitkamp reaches her hand out to meet Schumer’s as he lands at their side. They clasp hands, exchange a few inaudible words, and let go as Booker pats Schumer’s shoulder. The vote was about halfway through, so the hand clasp was not in reaction to a final tally. Typical high fives involve slapping of two hands in celebration. This was a very gradual meeting of awkwardly waving hands. "They were greeting each other to say hello, as senators often do during votes," said Abigail McDonough, Heitkamp’s communications director. Justin Goodman, Schumer’s press secretary, confirmed the senators did not speak about the vote when they greeted each other. The vote was held on a Monday night, so it was the first time a lot of the senators would have seen each other since the previous week. Rob Port, the editor of the blog, did not provide any evidence that the hand-gesture was about the vote. "Looked like a high five to me, but the video speaks for itself I think," Port said. The clip was generated by a C-SPAN user, who titled it "Heitkamp & Schumer High-Five Over Abortion Vote." Tom Campbell, Heitkamp’s Republican challenger, posted the clip to his Facebook page three hours before the SayAnythingBlog post was published. Our ruling A SayAnythingBlog.com headline said, "Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban." The headline suggests the celebration of a pro-abortion victory, but that’s not what the footage shows. The video shows an awkward hand waving-turned-holding between Schumer and Heitkamp on a Monday night. Both senators said they did not mention the vote on the floor, and that they were simply greeting each other. Port provided no evidence that the two were celebrating the vote.

pomt-07889	Israel's per capita income "is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/04/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-israels-capita-income-greater-proba/	House Republicans have released a plan to cut the budget, but Rand Paul says they need to cut even more. House GOP leaders proposed cuts of $58 billion per year. Paul, a Republican senator from Kentucky and a tea party favorite, has a plan that cuts $500 billion. Paul's plan includes cutting all foreign aid, including about $3 billion in annual aid to Israel. Cutting aid to Israel has got some of his fellow conservatives unhappy, but Paul isn't backing down. "I'm not singling out Israel. I'm a supporter of Israel," Paul said. "I want to be known as a friend of Israel, but you can't give money you don't have. We can't just borrow from our kids' future and give it to countries, even if they are our friends." Paul added that, "They're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world. Should we be giving free money or welfare to a rich nation? I don't think so." Paul added that Israel has defense capabilities already that are ahead of the country's potential enemies. Paul's phrasing suggested some uncertainty about Israel's wealth, so we decided to check it out. We discovered that there are several ways to calculate per capita income by country. The two major indicators we consulted showed that Israel was safely in the top 25 percent. The World Bank calculates per capita income two ways. One accounts for purchasing power and one doesn't. Purchasing power means that the measurement takes into account how goods are priced in a particular country. The World Bank statistics covered about 160 countries and territories. If you consider purchasing power, in 2009 Israel was No. 25 on the list of countries, with per capita income of $27,110. No. 1 was Luxembourg with $59,550. The United States was No. 5 with $45,640. If you don't consider purchasing power, Israel is No. 23, at $25,790. On this measure, Norway is No. 1 at $84,640, and the United States is No. 8 at $46,360. Either way, Israel makes the top 40, which puts it in the top 25 percent of the World Bank listings. Seeking the broadest possible measure, though, we looked for a more widespread account of how many countries there are in the world. The United Nations, for example, says it has 192 members. Other sources note that the independence of some countries is contested, so the number can shift depending on world events to anywhere between 191 and 196 countries. So even by the larger number of countries, Israel would still be in the top 25 percent. We find Paul's statement True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2011-02-04T17:12:02	2011-02-04	['Israel']
pomt-08798	Republicans tried to block the deficit commission.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/18/tim-kaine/dnc-chairman-says-republicans-blocked-move-cut-def/	Republicans keep talking about cutting the deficit, but they blocked President Barack Obama's efforts to actually do something about it, Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on the Aug. 15, 2010, segment of CBS Face the Nation. "The good news is, the president has said I'm going to do what the previous Democratic president, Bill Clinton, did. I'm going to get control of this deficit. And so he's cut domestic spending and -- and frozen discretionary spending. They're making strategic cuts to defense. He's got a deficit commission working that the Republicans tried to block." Kaine's statement made us wonder -- do Republicans talk the talk but refuse to walk the walk? We decided to look into it. We quickly found that what happened isn't as straightforward as Kaine makes out. It all began with a proposal to create the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action, co-sponsored by the top Democrat and the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H. It would have established an 18-member bipartisan commission to study the current and future fiscal condition of the federal government and make recommendations about how revenues and expenses can be brought into line. Those recommendations would be fast-tracked to the House and Senate floors under a special procedure. We checked the Senate voting records, and found that the proposal was ultimately rejected by a vote of 53-46. Though a majority voted for the commission, the proposal required 60 votes to avoid the possibility of a filibuster and pass it. Of the 46 people who voted "nay," 22 were Democrats. They were joined by 23 Republicans and Bernie Sanders, who is Independent. Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski was the only senator who did not cast a vote. She was absent for family reasons, but would have supported the proposal, her office told Politico. Reasons for opposing the panel varied widely. Some Democratic lawmakers worried that the commission would recommend drastic cuts to entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare. Republicans, on the other hand, feared steep tax increases and argued that the commission would not be focused enough on cutting spending. There were also concerns that the commission was infringing on Congress' territory. "Bureaucrats do not enact great legislation. Senators do!" said Max Baucus, the Democratic Senate Finance Committee chairman. As noted by a Politico story on Jan. 26, 2010, "The tepid support from Democratic leaders contributed to the loss, but more decisive was the number of Republicans switching under pressure from their party to block the measure." Days before the vote, seven Republicans who had supported the measure withdrew their co-sponsorship and eventually voted against it. "This vote on the deficit commission is like dozens of other votes this year where Republicans changed their support on a bill for purely political reasons. Had the seven Republicans who originally co-sponsored this bill voted for cloture, the deficit commission would have become law. And that is indisputable fact," Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said in an e-mail. Gregg, however, maintained that the White House should have been able to muster up the seven votes that were needed for the measure to pass. "Clearly, the White House has shown the ability to discipline their party in the Senate, and if they want to pass this, they should be able to … If they can get 60 for health care and 60 for pay-as-you-go limits, they can certainly get seven more votes." Then there was Sen. Brownback's proposal to create the Commission on Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies. The panel would have reviewed all federal programs to find those that are duplicative, ineffective, or have outlived their usefulness. The task force would focus exclusively on cutting spending, and would not consider raising taxes. The Senate failed to adopt the measure on Jan. 28, 2010, by a vote of 51-49. Again, 60 votes were required to ensure passage. Forty-five Democrats, three Republicans, and one Independent voted "nay." The debate came to a close on Feb. 18, 2010, when President Obama took matters into his own hands and signed an executive order to create the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The commission, which meets once a month while Congress is in session, is to propose recommendations designed to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. The final report must be available no later than Dec. 1, 2010, and will require the approval of at least 14 of the Commission's 18 members. Unlike the several commissions proposed by members of Congress, however, lawmakers are not required to vote on any of the panel's recommendations. Going back to the original claim. Kaine said that President Obama has a "deficit commission working that the Republicans tried to block." We found that several Republican lawmakers who originally supported the Bipartisan Task Force withdrew their co-sponsorship only days before the vote took place. Had they not done so, the proposal would have passed. At the same time, the Democratic leadership also failed to get all of its members in line -- 22 Democrats voted against the measure. Democrats also overwhelmingly voted down a Republican-backed panel that would have looked at ways to reduce the deficit through spending cuts. In all, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04650	Voter identification laws make it complicated and expensive to get an ID, essentially instituting a modern-day poll tax.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/12/american-civil-liberties-union/voter-id-laws-poll-tax-not-equivalent/	Voter identification laws, such as the one implemented in Georgia in 2007, have become a hot-button election issue. On one side, supporters have said the laws requiring voters to present some sort of government-approved -- and many times government-issued -- photo identification to vote are needed to prevent voter fraud. The GOP even included support of voter ID laws in its party platform adopted last month in Tampa during the Republican National Convention. On the other side, civil liberties and civil rights groups have said the laws lead to disenfranchisement of voters, particularly minority and older voters, by obstructing their voting rights. The American Civil Liberties Union has been one of the staunchest opponents of the voter ID laws, and it has repeatedly published information suggesting the laws suppress voting. But the voter suppression argument has not always been found to be accurate. A study of Georgia election data conducted this month by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, for example, found that participation among black voters rose by 44 percent from 2006 — before the law was implemented — to 2010. For Hispanics, the increase for the same period was 67 percent. Turnout among whites rose 12 percent. Even when African-American participation fell in 2010 after President Barack Obama’s 2008 election, a far greater share of black voters turned out in 2010 than in 2006, showing that Obama was not the only factor driving turnout. In its Summer 2012 edition of the Civil Liberties newsletter, the ACLU notes that "Since the 2008 election, more than 30 states have introduced laws that make it harder to cast a ballot. ... What’s more, most of these laws make it complicated and expensive to get an ID, essentially instituting a modern-day poll tax." Statistics about the voter ID laws have been repeated by people on both sides of the issue. But we wondered just much how of a dent does obtaining government identification make in the wallets of voters? Are the laws too complicated, and do they make it expensive to vote? And are the laws tantamount to a modern-day poll tax? The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that 33 states currently have voter ID laws, with varying criteria and accepted forms of documentation. The ACLU’s newsletter also reports that 25 percent of African-American voting-age citizens and 8 percent of white voting-age citizens lack government-issued photo IDs. The article also said these new voting laws were crafted to recast voting as a "privilege" reserved for certain segments of the population. PolitiFact has previously checked claims by several politicos, including Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., using statistics from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law about citizens lacking the government-issued photo IDs that were also cited by the ACLU. Both claims rated Mostly True. The ACLU newsletter labeled the new voter ID requirements as a "modern day poll tax." The historical poll tax emerged in parts of the U.S. in the late 1800s as a blatant effort to restrict voting. Primarily aimed at minorities, these laws -- along with literacy tests -- disenfranchised many black, Native American and poor white citizens. The poll tax was outlawed in federal elections in 1964. The poll tax portion of the ACLU claim, as a historical comparison, does not hold up. But the organization’s claim about the cost to voters is much tougher to evaluate. Some states, such as Georgia, which was among the first to implement voter ID laws, make it free for residents to obtain the government IDs and don’t require them for absentee voting. DMV Answers, a for-profit website, reported that for residents, the cost of getting a state-issued photo ID varies. On the low end, the IDs cost $5 in states such as Delaware, Iowa, Maine, South Carolina and West Virginia; while costs can reach as much as $33.50 in Oregon. Most of the states’ ID costs are at the lower end, ranging from $10 to $15, according to the site. In May, PolitiFact reviewed a claim by U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings that requests made to some Florida residents to submit proof of citizenship amounted to a "backdoor poll tax" because they had to buy a stamp to mail in the documents. Although experts said any election procedure that requires voters to incur some type of financial costs could be coined a poll tax, actual poll taxes were unaffordable to the African-Americans they affected. The Florida request was seen more as an inconvenience, and the claim received a Half True rating. Whether states offer the ID for a nominal fee or free of charge, there is still a cost, said Randolph McLaughlin, a professor at Pace Law School in New York who specializes in voting rights litigation and has argued several civil rights cases. "What do you need to get the ID? You have to prove who you are, so in some states you have to get a birth certificate and birth certificates cost money," McLaughlin said. "You have to pay to get a piece of paper to get the government-issued ID, and because the places that issue the ID have the same operating hours that most people work, you may have to miss work to get this card for a problem that doesn’t exist." The claim that the voter ID laws are the functional equivalent of a poll tax is difficult to prove. "The U.S. Supreme Court has not definitely settled this debate, although its 2008 decision in the Indiana voter ID case suggests that the poll tax claim faces an uphill battle," said Edward Foley, executive director of an election law center at The Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law. In that case, the high court found that Indiana’s requirement that voters present government-issued photo IDs did not violate the Constitution. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the main opinion in the 6-3 ruling, which said, "The application of the statute to the vast majority of Indiana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process." That brings us back to the claim that voter ID laws make it complicated and expensive to get an ID. Many states with these laws do incur some costs, but the costs vary greatly from state to state. The costs to voters to obtain the IDs also vary. In some states, the cost for the ID is free, but accompanying documents necessary to receive those free IDs can cost money and take time to get. That’s more an inconvenience than a hindrance. There is an element of truth to the ACLU statement. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression if presented. We rule the ACLU’s statement Mostly False.	None	American Civil Liberties Union	None	None	None	2012-09-12T06:00:00	2012-08-26	['None']
pomt-09233	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, cast votes for TARP, the stimulus, and an individual mandate for health care.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/12/george-will/george-will-pegs-sen-bennetts-loss-votes-tarp-stim/	The Tea Party movement shook the political world last weekend when two Utah Republicans knocked U.S. Sen. Robert Bennett out of contention for renomination during a state Republican convention. Commentators immediately hung Bennett's defeat on two of his past decisions -- to vote in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which helped bail out key financial institutions in 2008, and his efforts to co-sponsor a health care bill with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Both actions have been unpopular with Republicans, especially conservatives in the GOP's base. During a roundtable on ABC's This Week, syndicated columnist George Will took a crack at analyzing Bennett's defeat. "This is an anti-Washington year," Will said. "How do you get more Washington than a three-term senator who occupies the seat once held by his father, a four-term senator, who before that worked on the Senate staff and then as a lobbyist in Washington? He's a wonderful man and a terrific senator, but the fact is, he's going against terrific headwinds this year, and he cast three votes, TARP, stimulus, and an individual mandate for health care. Now, you might like one, two or all three of those, but being opposed to them is not outside the mainstream of American political argument." We checked to see whether Bennett did indeed vote for TARP, the stimulus and a requirement that individuals purchase health coverage. Here's what we found: • Bennett did vote for the TARP legislation (H.R. 1424) on Oct. 1, 2008, along with 33 other Republican senators. • Bennett voted against President Barack Obama's economic stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1), on Feb. 13, 2009. Only three Republican senators voted for the bill--Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. (Specter is now a Democrat.) • The only time that Bennett made a floor vote on a bill containing an individual health care mandate came with the Democratic health care bill. During the vote on final passage on Dec. 24, 2009, Bennett joined every other Republican in voting against the bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590). It's true that Bennett did co-sponsor the Healthy Americans Act with Wyden, and that measure did include a requirement that most Americans purchase health coverage. But it was significantly different from the main Democratic bill because it relied more heavily on health insurance exchanges. It never reached the floor for a vote, and because Will said that Bennett had "cast three votes," including one for an individual mandate, he was at best only partly accurate in characterizing Bennett's record on that issue. All told, Will was correct that Bennett voted for the TARP bill. But he was incorrect that Bennett voted for Obama's stimulus bill, and it was inaccurate for him to suggest that Bennett cast a vote for an individual mandate. He actually voted against a bill with an individual mandate, even though he also co-sponsored a bill that included an individual mandate that didn't advance out of committee. We rate Will's characterization of Bennett's votes Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	George Will	None	None	None	2010-05-12T17:00:48	2010-05-09	['Bob_Bennett_(politician)', 'Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program']
pomt-04699	"Under President Bush in eight years, we added $4.9 trillion to the debt. Under President Obama, we've added $5.3 trillion to the debt in the 3.5 years he's been in office."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/sep/05/kelly-ayotte/did-barack-obama-accrue-more-debt-half-time-george/	A few days before she hit the stage in front of a national audience at the Republican National Convention, U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte addressed a far smaller crowd in Merrimack, N.H. Despite the difference in venue, the New Hampshire Republican offered a similar message. During the town hall meeting, Ayotte, a Nashua native and freshman senator, took aim at President Obama and the growing debt under his administration. While she didn’t specifically blame the president for the debt, she used the speech to blast Obama for increased spending and stifling business. "Under President Bush in eight years, we added $4.9 trillion to the debt," Ayotte told the crowd Thursday, August 23, 2012, at Merrimack High School. "Under President Obama, we've added $5.3 trillion ... in the 3 1/2 years he's been in office." The numbers have been used before. Lastweek, PolitiFact gave a Mostly True ratingto a similar claim by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie that the debt has jumped $5 trillion during Obama’s time in office. But, does that mean Ayotte’s numbers are on target? Let’s take a look. The numbers aren’t hard to track. The U.S. Department of the Treasury tracks the national debt figures on its website, TreasuryDirect.gov. On the site, the treasury department divides the national debt into two main categories, debt held by the government and debt held by the public. But, in her statement, Ayotte is referring to the combined total, or total national debt, according to spokesman Jeff Grappone. According to the federal count, the total debt currently sits around $16 trillion. But, as of August, 23, when Ayotte made the statement, it was closer to $15.98 trillion. That figure is about $5.35 trillion higher than the $10.63 trillion debt Obama inherited when he came into office January 19, 2009. When Bush first came into office, the national debt was $5.73 trillion, and by the end of his eight years, it grew to $10.63 trillion -- an increase of exactly $4.9 trillion. So, Ayotte’s numbers look right on target. Still, as is so often the case, the numbers don’t tell the whole story, according to analysts. At PolitiFact, we consider not just the factual accuracy of a statement, but also whether credit and blame is fairly attributed. Federal spending records show that both Democrats and Republican share the blame for the increased spending. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress during Obama’s first two years, but Republicans have held the House of Representatives since January 2011. Further, as noted in the prior PolitiFact piece, much of the debt results from policies set under past presidents and lawmakers. So, the blame falls on both parties. "It’s true. They both contributed," said Ron Haskins, co-director of the Brookings Institution’s Budgeting for National Priorities Project. "I'm not too worked up about attributing 27 percent to this and 36 percent to that. But, the fact is that both presidents (Obama and George W. Bush) were irresponsible. We’re seeing the impact of that now." Our ruling: Ayotte’s got her numbers right. According to the treasury department’s count, the debt has grown $5.3 trillion since Obama took office in 2009, compared to $4.9 trillion in Bush’s eight years. Still, analysts say these figures don’t paint a full picture of the root causes of the debt.In her statement, Ayotte doesn’t attribute direct credit or blame, but she did use the speech to blast Obama and his policies.

pomt-02368	The American slave trade caused 5 million deaths "or more."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/18/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-slave-trade-caused-5-million-deaths/	Every war is filled with grim statistics, and Andrew Napolitano took a debate with Comedy Central’s Jon Stewart down that road when he brought up the Civil War’s casualties. President Abraham Lincoln, Napolitano argued, could have undone slavery "without causing the deaths of 785,000 human beings." "How many deaths of human beings were caused by the American slave trade?" Stewart shot back. "Unfortunately, a million and a half," Napolitano said. "Try 5 million or more," Stewart said. We are fact-checking several claims from the Civil War debate between Napolitano, a libertarian pundit and former judge, and Stewart. Here we are looking at if the American slave trade, the process by which people were acquired and sold into slavery, resulted in the death of 5 million people or more. (Statistics focus on the slave trade, because experts say it's impossible to know the overall death toll caused by slavery in America.) We asked Comedy Central for Stewart’s source and did not hear back. But it seems likely Stewart got his information from another Daily Show guest. Historian Manisha Sinha from the University of Massachusetts was part of a panel in a mock game show called The Weakest Lincoln. Asked during the game to estimate the number of deaths, Sinha said 2 million to 5 million might have perished. So that would put Stewart on the high end of one estimate. But Stewart made an error in his characterization. Sinha was talking about the Atlantic slave trade, which included slaves bound for South America, the Caribbean as well as North America, while Stewart focused on the American slave trade. So what's the American share? Starting in the late 1960s, historians began culling hard numbers on the slave trade from shipping manifests and other original documents. The result is the Trans-Atlantic Slave Database. It has tabulated an estimated 80 percent of the traffic in human beings and found about 10.7 million people survived the passage from their homeland between 1500 and 1866. Of that, about 390,000 made it to North American soil. This was about 3 percent of the total. Historian Herbert Klein of Columbia and Stanford universities, who worked on the database, said that the data suggest about 85,000 people destined for North America did not survive the trip across the Atlantic -- far below 5 million. (The same data show deaths caused by the slave trade in all of North and South America at about 1.8 million.) However, as exact as this information might be, it only goes so far. Much data is missing, either because it was lost or because no records were kept of the illegal shipments of slaves to North America that took place after 1808. That was the year when the United States banned the importation of slaves from Africa. Plus, as we noted, the database counts only the deaths due to the capture and transport of slaves and says nothing about the people who died in bondage from brutality, disease and deprivation. When the Civil War began, about 4 million people lived in slavery. According to the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, half of all their babies died in the first year of life. That was twice the rate for white babies. Stanford Medical School cites the statistic that in 1850, the life expectancy of slaves was four years less than for whites. Our ruling Stewart said the American slave trade caused the deaths of at least 5 million people. Stewart appears to be using an estimate for deaths associated with the slave trade in North and South America. America's portion is much smaller, an expert told us. We rate Stewart’s claim False.

pomt-05156	Says that under President Obama, there’s been a substantial increase in federal government jobs.	false	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/20/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-there-has-been-substantial-increa/	How’s the economy doing? Judging from President Barack Obama’s recent gaffe (the private sector "is doing fine") and public reaction, the answer might depend upon which sector employs you. The White House quickly said that the president was simply trying to say that state and local governments need help to stem job losses. But U.S. Sen. Rob Portman saw it differently. Portman, an Ohio Republican, told a conference call with reporters on June 14 that Obama’s point was that "the reason the economy is weak is because we are losing too many government jobs." Whether Portman accurately interpreted Obama’s point or not, he quickly moved to knock it down. "Well first of all," Portman said, "we are not losing government jobs. If you look at the overall net jobs in the federal government, we’ve actually seen an increase in federal government jobs, and pretty substantially. There have been some reductions in state and local jobs, I don’t know what the net number is, but I would just make the point that I made earlier: If you are looking to grow the economy, the way to grow the economy is not to grow more public-sector jobs." His claim that the federal government has added jobs, published on Cleveland.com, The Plain Dealer’s online arm, caught the attention of a skeptical reader. PolitiFact Ohio agreed it was worth examining. Has the federal government substantially increased its hiring? Portman did not specify a period for this purported increase, but his comments were about the weak economic recovery and what he says was Obama’s inadequate approach dating to the stimulus. So we’ll use the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed in February 2009, as the baseline. The federal government had nearly 2.8 million employees when the stimulus passed. (The exact number, important here, is 2.795 million.) Then, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics: The number grew to 3.4 million by May 2010. PolitiFact has examined that growth spurt several times and found it was because of temporary 2010 Census hiring, long-planned and independent of any White House action. By October 2010, the number of federal workers had dropped to 2.86 million and by May 2012, the most recent most available, it was projected to be 2.819 million. The number has dropped slowly every single month since March 2011. You can assess this a couple of ways. The trend for more than a year has been downward, while the net number since the stimulus passed in early 2009 is up -- by 24,000. Yet Portman’s point was clear: that the proper way to grow the economy is through private sector jobs, not public sector jobs. He didn’t say federal jobs have inched upward. He said they have grown "pretty substantially." How big is substantial? Federal employment on net has grown by less than 1 percent since the stimulus passed, BLS data and our calculator show. His characterization of state and local government employment is correct. State employment fell from 5.188 million workers when the stimulus passed to 5.073 million in May, or by 115,000 jobs. At the local government level, cities, towns, townships and counties dropped overall employment from 14.594 million when the stimulus passed to 14.077 million in May, a loss of 517,000 jobs. The losses came as local and state governments cut their payrolls in response to lower tax collections -- itself a result of the weak economy. As for federal employment, the subject of Portman’s claim, it shows a net growth in the three-plus years since the stimulus passed, but that growth is modest at best, and it is now trending downward month after month. Characterizing a net increase of less than 1 percent as substantial is inaccurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman’s claim rates False.

pomt-12204	Say Oscar Pistorius "commits suicide in prison."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/24/blog-posting/fake-newsoscar-pistorius-did-not-commit-suicide/	The first tip-off that jailed South African Olympian Oscar Pistorius might not be dead, as a fake news item claimed, was the misspelling of his name. "Oscar Pistorious commits suicide in Prison," topped the article on a website that flies under the masthead of City Herald. The additional "o" indicated the piece was dodgy, but the blunders didn’t stop there. The article said Pistorius hanged himself in his prison cell, allegedly by tying a bedsheet to a window. It noted that prison officials announced the death on Saturday, but then added that he died at 5:30 in the morning on Sunday. Comments posted on the article’s webpage showed that odd time sequence didn’t slip by careful readers. "If this was news (bearing in mind you say it happened Sunday morning ZA time, but they managed to announce it on Saturday), it would be all over the international press, the BBC, Reuters, eNCA (a South African television news service)... not a sniff, anywhere," wrote one man. The Pretoria-based Centurion Rekord, a legitimate news source, took the time to check with the family. "Rekord has spoken the brother, Carl Pistorius who said that the family knows nothing of the sort," the paper reported July 17. Similarly, the official website for Oscar Pistorius has nothing about his death. Pistorius is serving a six-year sentence for shooting his girlfriend in 2013, sparking a courtroom drama that drew worldwide attention. Pistorius, a Paralympic gold medalist, claimed he fired on Reeva Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder in the couple’s apartment. The details remain murky and initially, Pistorius was found guilty of negligent homicide. But a higher court overturned that ruling and declared him guilty of murder. There were rumors in 2016 that Pistorius attempted suicide in jail, but he and his lawyers denied those accounts. The Centurion Rekord described the item about Pistorius’ death as fake news, and we fully agree. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-11693	"Roy Moore takes the military vote, pulls ahead by 5,000 votes"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/27/defense-usa/no-roy-moore-wont-win-alabama-race-military-ballot/	Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore appeared to hold out hope that military ballots would reverse his loss to Democrat Doug Jones -- and the theory was circulated as fake news. "Roy Moore takes the military vote, pulls ahead by 5,000 votes," said the headline on the website defense-usa.xyz on Dec. 15, three days after Moore, a Republican, lost to Jones. We found no contact information on this website to probe the story further. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The special U.S. Senate election in Alabama was the subject of many fake news stories. This one, too, is fake. According to the story, the "Alabama Secretary of State’s Division Of Electoral Balloting Integrity" had sent emails to media outlets regarding the military vote count, which showed that Moore led by 5,014 votes after 97 percent of the vote had been counted. Jones would have to pay $213 million for a recount, the story stated. "The Secretary of State’s office has already announced that the election won’t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he’ll waste the taxpayers’ time and money with a fruitless recount," stated the article. "They can never just admit when they lost." In reality, there is no such entity as the "Alabama Secretary of State’s Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity." And the number of ballots cast do not bear out what the story alleged. The official Alabama Secretary of State’s website showed that Jones received 671,151 votes while Moore received 650,436. Moore appeared to hope that military and provisional ballots would turn the tide for him after the election. In a Dec. 15 email to supporters, Moore wrote that those votes were yet to be counted and that the election was "too close to call" and "the battle is NOT OVER!" On Dec. 20, Secretary of State John Merrill provided information showing that there were 366 military and overseas ballots returned. Merrill also reported that there was a total of 4,967 provisional ballots received and of those, 2,888 had been verified. That means that even if all of the overseas and provisional ballots were cast for Moore -- an unlikely scenario -- that would not add up to enough to change the outcome of the race since Jones had a lead of more than 20,000 votes. The state is expected to certify the election results on Dec. 28. A spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office said that the final results are not significantly different from the unofficial numbers from election night but will include slight increases for both candidates due to the late-counted military and provisional ballots. The viral post saying Moore pulled ahead of Jones thanks to overseas and provisional ballots is not accurate. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-07065	"We've got more revenue than we ever have."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/28/jim-demint/jim-demint-says-federal-government-has-more-revenu/	On the June 26, 2011, edition of CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., supported the decision by Republican budget negotiators to keep tax increases off the table. Two leading congressional Republicans -- House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. -- pulled out of bipartisan talks on how to avoid federal debt exceeding a congressionally approved limit. If no action is taken and the debt limit is exceeded in August, the U.S. could be viewed as defaulting on its obligations, which could in turn trigger wider economic difficulties. CNN host Candy Crowley asked DeMint -- a leader of fiscal conservatives in the Senate -- "Why shouldn't we just look at this and say it is another giant game of ‘chicken’ by our legislators?" DeMint responded, "Well, we've got more revenue than we ever have. We're spending more than we ever have. We don't -- we don't have a revenue problem. We have a spending problem. The government is doing things that we can't do well. We're wasting billions of dollars. And we're not going to address that waste and fraud until we have to." A reader asked us whether the federal government currently has "more revenue than we ever have." So we decided to take a look. We turned to historical data tables from the Office of Management and Budget. First, we looked at raw dollars for federal receipts for fiscal years going back to 1901. These numbers primarily include revenue from federal taxes, though a small portion includes money from tariffs and other sources. For fiscal year 2010 -- the last year for which final numbers are available -- federal revenue totaled $2.16 trillion. The figure for fiscal year 2011, which is a projection, is $2.17 trillion. But neither is the highest in U.S. history. Three other years exceeded both years’ figures -- 2006 (with $2.41 trillion in receipts), 2007 (with $2.57 trillion) and 2008 (with $2.52 trillion). But raw figures aren’t even the best measurement, since they take no account of the size of the economy as a whole. As the nation’s economy grows over the long term, receipts tend to go up -- and over the long term, the economy, as measured by gross domestic product, has grown dramatically, making raw-number comparisons over time problematic. OMB also offers a historical table for receipts as a share of GDP. And this yardstick makes the inaccuracy of DeMint’s statement even clearer. In fiscal year 2010, federal receipts accounted for 14.9 percent of GDP, a number that’s projected to fall to 14.4 percent of GDP by fiscal year 2011. To find a level lower than that, you have to go back to the days of the Korean War, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the gray flannel suit. In 1950, federal receipts as a percentage of GDP amounted to 14.4 percent. During the subsequent six decades, the share typically hovered between 16 percent and 20 percent. When we contacted DeMint’s office, spokesman Wesley Denton said the absolute levels of federal tax revenues collected in many of the most recent years have been at or near record levels, even if it wasn’t the case for 2010. "It is absolutely clear that recent years have seen the highest tax revenues on record, but our spending has skyrocketed even more," Denton said. "If spending were today at 2003 spending levels, hardly a time of miserly spending, we'd be running a surplus instead of a deficit." (We checked Denton’s 2003 comparison, and he’s correct.) Still, for the specific statement DeMint made on CNN -- which is the claim that we’re checking -- DeMint was wrong using either standard. He was off by a few years using raw dollar figures. And when you use tax revenue as a share of gross domestic product -- which is a better yardstick for this sort of comparison -- he was off by six decades. So we rate DeMint’s statement False.

pomt-01298	"All of Liberia can produce less than one-third as much electricity as the Dallas Cowboys football stadium consumes at peak times."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/30/nicholas-kristof/kristof-dallas-cowboys-stadium-draws-3-times-more-/	As President Barack Obama and countless public health experts keep saying, "Ground Zero" in the fight against Ebola are the countries in West Africa. In a recent op-ed, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof repeated that cry, saying American military help there was crucial. Left to their own, Nicholas said, these nations have no chance. "These are lovely countries with friendly people and some heroic health workers, but roads, electricity and other infrastructure are desperately weak," Kristof said. "All of Liberia can produce less than one-third as much electricity as the Dallas Cowboys football stadium consumes at peak times." A reader wondered about Kristof’s claim, which essentially is: The country of Liberia cannot produce enough power to fuel one American football stadium at its peak demand. To be sure, the Cowboys home field, AT&T Stadium, is no small affair. The domed stadium seats 80,000 people, has the world’s largest high-definition video screen (70 feet by 160 feet), and plenty of air conditioning to match the heat of a Texas autumn. It covers 73 acres, cost a reported $1.3 billion to build and opened in 2009. Liberia, meanwhile, isn’t the biggest country, but still, it has more than 4 million people. Geography-wise, it’s the 104th-largest country and about the size of Cuba. So what do the facts say? According the U.S. Energy Information Service, Liberia had installed capacity of 197 megawatts in 2011. The CIA World Factbook has the same figure. (For comparison, the United States has a capacity to generate more than 1 million megawatts.) That means Liberia, at any one time, can generate 197 megawatts of electricity. So how does 197 megawatts compare to peak demand at AT&T Stadium? A rock solid answer proved to be elusive, but we found a reasonable estimate. We would have clear figures if the Dallas Cowboys would say how much electricity the stadium uses at its peak. They refused. A spokesman told PunditFact, "We don’t give out those kinds of numbers." However, Oncor, the firm that installed the stadium’s electric system provided a helpful clue. Oncor is a Texas electric company and on its website, it boasts about the work its engineers and contractors did for the Cowboys. In that write-up, Oncor made this interesting comparison. "The stadium, which is the largest domed stadium in the world, uses more power than most medium-sized cities." An Oncor spokesman would tell us nothing more than that, but we turned to Douglas Gotham, director of the State Utility Forecasting Group at Purdue University’s College of Engineering. Gotham did some back-of-the-envelope math for us based on what we know about medium-sized U.S. cities. He chose Evansville, Ind., with a population of about 120,000. "The peak demand for the entire utility service area is about 1,500 megawatts," Gotham told us. "About half of that roughly is in the city itself, so we’re looking at about 750 megawatts at the peak." With Evansville being on the low end of medium-sized cities, Gotham said the comparison is close. If AT&T Stadium can use at least 750 megawatts at its peak, that is more than three times what Liberia can produce -- if Oncor is right. "The statement about Liberia is in the ballpark," Gotham said. We found some other examples of medium-sized cities that bolster Gotham's estimate. Knoxville, Tenn., population 183,000, has a peak demand of 1,109 megawatts. Huntsville, Ala., population 186,000, has a peak demand of 1,150 megawatts. Eugene, Ore., population 159,000, has a peak demand of 480 megawatts. Many factors such as location and the number of industrial users shape electricity consumption, but overall, the pattern reinforces Gotham's conclusion. (These cities have municipal electric companies that mainly supply power within the city borders.) Some lingering data questions in Dallas There’s one other wrinkle to this comparison. Kristof’s New York Times article linked to a 2013 Wall Street Journal piece that discussed the comparison between Liberia and AT&T stadium. The Wall Street Journal cited the work of a utility analyst with the Bernstein Alliance asset management firm. The analyst, Bob Brackett, was intrigued when Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf made the comparison in 2013. So Brackett tried to run the numbers. He said peak demand at the stadium was 10 megawatts and that Liberia could generate less than a third of that. Both numbers seem to be way off. We reached Brackett’s office but we never heard back from him to learn where he got his data. Our ruling Kristof said that Liberia can produce one-third as much electricity as the Cowboys stadium draws at its peak. U.S. government data shows that Liberia has nearly 200 megawatts of installed electricity capacity. The utility that worked on the stadium’s electrical system said the facility used more power than most medium-sized cities. Using that benchmark, a utility expert from one the country’s leading engineering schools concluded that peak demand at the stadium would fall in the range of 750 megawatts. That would mean that Liberia can produce less than one-third as much electricity as the Dallas football stadium consumes at peak times. Exact figures are not available, but the basic comparison works. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Nicholas Kristof	None	None	None	2014-10-30T14:32:09	2014-10-22	['Liberia', 'Dallas_Cowboys']
pomt-14366	"Our campaign depends on small donations for the majority of our support."	mostly false	/nbc/statements/2016/mar/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-her-campaign-depends-small-do/	Following victories in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Illinois, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton thanked her supporters — especially those who have given small amounts of money to her campaign. "Keep contributing at hillaryclinton.com. Please, please join the 950,000 supporters who already have contributed, most less than $100, because our campaign depends on small donations for the majority of our support," Clinton said. We wondered whether it's accurate to say that her campaign "depends on small donations for the majority of our support." This is a surprisingly tricky question to answer. Under Federal Election Commission rules, campaigns must register the personal data of donors who give $200 or more. (That includes name, occupation, employer and ZIP code.) That $200 amount can be in the form of one donation of at least $200, or in a series of donations that collectively equal at least $200. However, if a donor gives an amount less than $200, the campaign is not required to disclose the donor's name. Such donations are often called "small-dollar contributions" or "unitemized donations." Candidates like to play up their small-dollar donations because they are a sign of grass-roots strength. For instance, the Bernie Sanders campaign often talks up its large small-donor base and small average donations. And in fact, of all the 2016 candidates, Sanders has done the best in this regard: Through Jan. 31, Sanders raised $67 million from small donors, or a whopping 70 percent of all the money he took in from individuals, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign finance data. Clinton, for her part, raised a little under $22 million from small donors over the same period, or 17 percent of her total fundraising haul from individuals. That percentage rose a bit with the release of donations through Feb. 29 — Clinton has now raised more than $28 million from small donors, or 19 percent of her individual donations. (Among the remaining Republicans, Ted Cruz had the highest small-donation percentage with 42 percent. Donald Trump had 22 percent and John Kasich had 11 percent, though both Trump and Kasich have taken in much smaller amounts overall from small donors.) So, compared with Sanders, Clinton has raised a smaller dollar total from small donors, and a smaller percentage of her individual contributions have come from from small donors. In other words, if she wants to emphasize the strength of her grassroots support, she needs to find different statistics to highlight. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said that more than 50 percent of the money the campaign has raised in February and March has come from what they call "online grassroots donations." This is a continuation of a pattern the campaign originally noted in a Washington Post article in mid February. And when the campaign released its campaign-finance data through Feb. 29, it reported that the average donation in February was about $50, and that 98 percent of donations were smaller than $250. These do sound like strong statistics to bolster the campaign's grassroots cred — but it also highlights a mismatch between what the campaign says and what fact-checkers can verify. Put simply, once the debate turns to the number of donors and the scope of online donations, reporters simply have to trust that the campaigns are being honest. Consider the number Clinton cited — that she has 950,000 individual contributors. (That's about what the Sanders campaign said he had in January 2016, when it said it had just passed the 1 million donor mark.) Figures such as these come from the campaigns' internal databases and are not filtered through the federal disclosure system, where they can be analyzed by independent groups. And no campaign has thus far let fact-checkers dig into their donor lists. So just knowing the amount of money raised from small donors won't tell you how many people gave. "A lump-sum unitemized receipt of $100,000 could be 100,000 donors, 5,000 donors, or any number in between — your guess is as good as mine," said Kenneth A. Gross, an elections and campaign-finance expert at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Viveca Novak, editorial and communications director for the Center for Responsive Politics, agreed. "It's impossible for us to check claims about things like how many donors have given to a candidate and what the average amount per donor is," she said. This means we're left with the federal disclosure data, which produces weaker support for Clinton's statement. If one defines "the majority of our support" as dollars, then Clinton is wrong — small donations accounted for 17 percent of all of her individual donations, which is well short of a majority. In fact, the Campaign Finance Institute calculated that a clear majority of the funds Clinton had raised through Jan. 31 from individuals came from donors giving $2,700 — the legal maximum that anyone can give. On the other hand, the campaign could be right if they define "the majority of our support" as the number of donors. But this calculation isn't transparent to outside analysis. "Whenever a politician makes a claim about their average contribution or total number of donors, it's impossible to independently verify," said Michael Beckel, a reporter with the Center for Public Integrity. Our ruling Clinton said, "Our campaign depends on small donations for the majority of our support." The campaign's best evidence for this isn't independently verifiable. Otherwise, Clinton is wrong — small donors accounted for only 17 percent of the dollar amount her campaign has collected from individuals through Jan. 31, and 19 percent of the dollar amount collected through Feb. 29.

pomt-10541	"Barack Obama loves Che Guevara."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/22/blog-posting/flag-was-there-but-obama-wasnt-waving-it/	Barack Obama has been subjected to chain e-mail attacks that falsely claim he is a Muslim, that he refused to put his hand on his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance and of taking an oath of office with a Koran. He’s even been accused of being anti-American for not wearing an American flag pin. Here’s the latest chapter: The Barack Obama Revolucion. This one originates with a local Fox 26 story in Houston. The camera follows two Obama volunteers whooping it up as they enter a new campaign office. The reporter talks about the importance of the Hispanic vote in Houston. Though it went unmentioned, many viewers had a moment of “Wait, is that a....?” Yep, a large Cuban flag with the image of Che Guevara on it can be seen prominently hanging behind the desk of one of the volunteers. Ernesto “Che” Guevara was a Latin American guerrilla leader and Marxist revolutionary, a major figure in the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro in the late 1950s. Although hailed in some leftist circles as a legendary icon of rebellion, the Argentine-born doctor is also reviled by many Cubans for ruthlessly ordering the execution of more than 150 prisoners in Cuba without a fair trial. Not surprisingly, it didn’t take long for the Fox video to make the rounds on the Internet. More than 70,000 people viewed the video on YouTube. Many blogs picked up the story and ran with it under headlines such as “Barack Obama Loves Che Guevara” at this site and “Barack Obama is a Che Fan” at this one. And the photos have been widely spread via chain e-mails that suggest Obama supports Che Guevara. On Feb. 11, Orlando Sanchez, a native of Cuba and treasurer of Houston’s Harris County weighed in: “I was outraged to see an image of Che arrogantly displayed over the Cuban flag hanging in the Houston offices of the Obama for President.” Sanchez, a Republican, is the first Cuban-American elected countywide in Harris County, which boasts the largest concentration of Latinos in Texas. He requested, "on behalf of all Cuban Americans" that Obama demand the flag's removal. After the whole thing blew up on the Internet, Fox 26 in Houston went back and interviewed the woman who had the flag hanging behind her desk. Her name is Maria Isabel and on an Obama Web page she describes herself as a precinct captain for Barack Obama in Houston. When asked about the flag, Isabel said, “It’s a distraction. I don’t have time to talk about the Cuban flag.” Isabel, who said she was born in Cuba, cut off the interview when the reporter asked if she wanted to apologize for the flag. “Apologize for what? I think it is a waste of time and it (the interview) is taking too much of my time.” On Feb. 12, the Obama campaign sought to put the issue to rest. “This is a volunteer office that is not in any way controlled by the Obama campaign,” a statement from the campaign reads. “We were disappointed to see this picture because it is both offensive to many Cuban-Americans -- and Americans of all backgrounds -- and because it does not reflect Senator Obama’s views. Barack Obama has been very clear in putting forward a Cuba policy that is based on one principle: freedom for the Cuban people.” A disclaimer now appears below the Web site with the Fox 26 video of the women opening the office. “The office featured in this video is funded by volunteers of the Barack Obama Campaign and is not an official headquarters for his campaign.” Nick Shapiro, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said he has heard that the flag was taken down. “But honestly, it’s not our office,” he said on Feb. 21, 2008. “It is not an official campaign office. She is a volunteer precinct captain. Her views do not reflect the views of the campaign.” The question is whether or not it's accurate to say “Obama Loves Che Guevara,” or any of the many variations of that theme now floating around the Internet, based upon this one decoration in this one office put up by this one volunteer. We say no. We say Pants on Fire.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2008-02-22T00:00:00	2008-02-18	['Che_Guevara', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-00450	"I don’t take a dime of PAC money."	true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/20/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-he-doesnt-accept-pac-donations/	After Beto O’Rourke said on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher that he wants to help get the country back on track, Maher asked: "And you don’t take PAC money?" O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman nominated by Democrats to face Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in November 2018, replied during the program’s March 16, 2018, episode: "I don’t take a dime of PAC money--no corporations, no special interests." MAHER: "First of all, for those, anybody who’s watching that might not be a political junkie, what is PAC money? What does that mean?" O’ROURKE: "So, political action committees represent the corporations and interests that have business before Congress — so the pharmaceutical industries, the telecom industries, the energy industries, the insurance industries — and they give money to members of Congress not just for access, although that’s part of it. "They’re also buying outcomes, actual legislative language that appears in the bills, and in the bills that become laws," O’Rourke said. "When you wonder why Congress is so dysfunctional, why it doesn’t represent the interests of the people it purports to serve, it’s because it’s so tied to the sources of money that are coming in." O’Rourke, initially elected to the House in 2012, accepted PAC donations through his 2014 re-election. In 2017, we rated Half True an O’Rourke claim that he was one of two members of Congress taking no corporate cash or political action committee money. (There were five, and no member of Congress can legally take corporate cash.) O’Rourke had received about $297,000 in PAC donations in his House bids of 2012 and 2014 but hadn’t accepted PAC aid from 2015 into 2017. O’Rourke, who announced his Senate candidacy in March 2017, has since out-raised Cruz in all but one quarter. O'Rourke campaign's finance reports So, has O’Rourke also not taken PAC money? Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign replied to our inquiry about this claim by noting in an email that for the second quarter of 2018, O’Rourke reported raising more than $10.4 million from individuals and absent PAC donations. Evans said all of O’Rourke’s 2017-18 filings with the Federal Election Commission would show a similar pattern--all contributions from individuals, none from PACs. On the FEC’s website, we checked O’Rourke’s seven campaign finance reports covering 2017 through June 2018. In the period, the reports state, O’Rourke’s campaign reported raising more than $23.5 million entirely from individuals. Each report shows a zero for contributions from PACs. Cruz’s Senate campaign reported raising more than $14 million in the same period--counting a little over $1 million from PACs, according to its finance report filed in July 2018. A PAC’s bundling Months after O’Rourke made his claim to Maher, Cruz’s campaign suggested that O’Rourke had benefited from a PAC’s--running afould of his no-PACs self-description. In July 2018, as noted in a Dallas Morning News account, Cruz said O’Rourke had accepted $167,408 in contributions collected, or bundled, from individuals by the J Street PAC, which says it endorses candidates based on goals including a focus on American diplomacy "toward a two-state outcome between Israel and the Palestinians." To our inquiry, Evans defended the PAC-bundled donations, saying by email: "Each contribution was made by an individual following individual contribution limits and the reporting requirements mandated for individuals such as name, address, employer." We separately heard back from the Center for Responsive Politics, which has long tracked the influence of money in politics. Andrew Mayersohn told us by email that the center doesn’t consider PAC earmarking/bundling of donations by individuals to be the same as a PAC contribution. Mayersohn also pointed us to an Aug. 6, 2018, Associated Press fact-check confirming that $170,000 in donations by individuals were routed to O’Rourke’s campaign through the J Street PAC, "which also hosted an event to collect individual donations to put directly toward his campaign." That story quotes an unidentified FEC spokeswoman saying the commission doesn’t consider individuals’ donations delivered through "conduit" PACs to be PAC money. The AP story went on: "Neither do campaign finance experts, who say the donations are more transparent than PAC donations. ‘No, it's not a PAC donation,’ said Victoria Farrar-Myers, an expert on campaign finance at Southern Methodist University in Dallas." Noted too: By law, individual donations are capped at $2,700 per election while PACs may donate up to $5,000. Our ruling O’Rourke told Maher: "I don’t take a dime of PAC money." O’Rourke’s campaign finance reports from the launch of his candidacy in 2017 through June 2018 show no PAC contributions. O’Rourke didn’t object to a PAC focused on Israel bundling donations for his campaign, but all of those were made by individuals. We rate this claim True.

pomt-06758	Says Gov. Rick Scott is "spending a quarter of a million of our tax dollars to robocall people."	false	/florida/statements/2011/aug/22/florida-voter/caller-accuses-gov-rick-scott-using-tax-dollars-hi/	After Republican Gov. Rick Scott launched robocalls in 2011 talking up his efforts to get Floridians jobs and his vetoes of "special interest projects," an anti-Scott group declared robocall revenge. Pink Slip Rick encouraged Floridians to call Scott back. And lots of Scott critics responded. On Aug. 17, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow played some of Floridians' calls posted on Pink Slip Rick's website. One of those calls was from Debra B: "Uh yeah, Gov. Rick Scott, you've got a lot of nerve spending a quarter of a million of our tax dollars to robocall people and tell them how good a job you're doing." Did Scott spend $250,000 in taxpayer money to make robocalls? (In a related Truth-O-Meter item, we rate another caller's claim that Scott cut state funding for PBS.) Typically robocalls occur during the height of campaign season. But Scott started his months after he won election, as part of an image makeover in the wake of low approval ratings and his efforts to speak directly to voters. The Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times first reported the robocalls May 27 and described them this way June 29: The calls have been coming most every week, the same amiable voice on the other side of the line. "Hi this is Gov. Rick Scott. I wanted to personally call and share some very encouraging news about our efforts to get Florida back to work. ... Unemployment is down for five straight months, bucking the national trend." Scott's calls have also talked about property tax cuts, fighting drug abuse and vetoing "wasteful special interest projects" by GOP legislators. Pink Slip Rick then encouraged Floridians to call back and posted many calls on its website. The Pink Slip Rick campaign is sponsored by Florida Watch Action, a progressive group. The executive director of Florida Watch Action is Susannah Randolph, wife of state Rep. Scott Randolph, D-Orlando, and former campaign manager to former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson. The Truth-O-Meter gave Pink Slip Rick a Pants on Fire for its April 2, 2011, claim that Scott lost 331,227 jobs. About 300 people left messages for Scott in August and Pink Slip Rick then forwarded them on to the governor, Susannah Randolph told us in an interview. How the robocalls were funded Now to the meat of the claim -- who paid for Scott's calls? The Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times, the Orlando Sentinel and the Palm Beach Post reported that the Republican Party of Florida paid for the robocalls. "Technically, it's political party intrusion, not government intrusion, because state party campaign donations are paying for the calls, which can cost as little as 2 cents each," the Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times wrote June 29. RPOF spokesman Brian Hughes confirmed for PolitiFact Florida in an Aug. 18 e-mail that RPOF -- not the state -- paid for the robocalls. He also sent us a link to a July 21 St. Petersburg Times blog post that stated RPOF spent $149,450 for the past three months on the robocalls -- and confirmed the blog was accurate. The Palm Beach Post said in an Aug. 5 article that "Since the May poll, the Republican Party of Florida spent more than $500,000 on robo-calls, polling and Google ads touting Scott's achievements." "I would say $500,000 for a variety of communication and outreach to the voters of Florida seems accurate," Hughes wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida. Randolph said she knew that, in this case, the caller had her facts wrong and that the party paid for Scott's robocalls. But Randolph said that the only calls that were omitted from the Pink Slip Rick website were a couple that were profane. "A lot of calls were opinions about the governor -- their own personal stories about what they are going through," Randolph said. "A lot of folks calling in are average middle-class Floridians who don't follow politics the way we follow it. ... We are not going to fact-check people's personal stories." Our ruling "Debra B." said that Scott had "a lot of nerve spending a quarter of a million of our tax dollars to robocall people and tell them how good a job you're doing." He didn't spend tax dollars -- the Republican Party of Florida picked up the tab. Particularly after a session of massive budget cuts, it's a tall claim to accuse Scott of spending tax dollars to promote himself in robocalls, and that's not what he did here. We rate this claim False.	None	Florida voter	None	None	None	2011-08-22T16:10:19	2011-08-17	['None']
pomt-13150	Says Hillary Clinton "shows up in Broward County" and had a private meeting with elections supervisor Brenda Snipes.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2016/oct/31/roger-stone/no-roger-stone-hillary-clinton-did-not-meet-browar/	As early voters in Florida started casting votes, conservative websites buzzed about new evidence of crooked campaign tactics by Hillary Clinton to secure the crucial battleground state. The alleged scheme centered on left-leaning Broward County, already in the news for distributing some mail-in ballots without Amendment 2, a proposal to legalize medical marijuana. The claims originated from Roger Stone, a Donald Trump supporter and former campaign operative who talked of a "secret" meeting in an interview to conspiracy theorist and radio show host Alex Jones on Oct. 26. "Yesterday Hillary Clinton shows up in Broward County — slips into a private meeting with the woman who runs the board of elections," said Stone, who lives in Fort Lauderdale. It’s common for election supervisors to meet with party officials if they have questions about election procedures. But a meeting directly with a presidential candidate would be unusual. Broward has about 600,000 Democratic voters — the highest number in Florida — so it is a key county for Clinton. Jones has millions of followers. The claim about Clinton secretly meeting with Brenda Snipes took off on social media, and some suggested that it was part of a voter fraud scheme. We found no evidence that such a meeting took place — because it didn’t. Within days, Stone retracted his claim. (A retraction doesn’t allow a political figure to avoid the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain what he initially said and then his latest explanation.) No meeting When we first heard the claim about a Snipes-Clinton meeting we were skeptical. Although Snipes is a Democrat, the former school administrator is not known for partisan or political involvement. In fact, a long list of politicians endorsed her opponent in the primary, although Snipes then won in a landslide. Snipes was first appointed to the position in 2003 by Republican Gov. Jeb Bush. In an Oct. 27 interview, Snipes told us she hadn’t met with Clinton. "She has not requested a meeting from me," Snipes said. "I haven’t met with anybody and neither has my staff. I don’t even know who the members of her staff are. Neither I nor my staff met with Hillary Clinton." Snipes told the Sun Sentinel that it was a "big fat lie" that she met with Clinton. A spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign in Florida also denied that such a meeting took place. Stone said he would post photos of the Clinton-Snipes meeting on Jones’ website Infowars "shortly" but never did. When we spoke to Stone on Oct. 28, he explained how he heard the allegation -- third-hand. He lacked even the most basic details, such as where this alleged meeting took place. He said information came from a coordinator for Citizens for Trump, a grassroots group. Stone said that the coordinator told him he spoke with two women from Citizens for Trump. The women said that they saw Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes. "They claim they were inadvertently in a secured area of a presidential candidate visit," when they spotted Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes. "Both admit they ran, they left the place in a hurry because they were shooed off by security." The women tried to take photos and video while they were dashing away, Stone said. The photos didn’t show anything, and Stone said he is waiting for video. "If Snipes denies it and there is no evidence to the contrary, I can say this is an incorrect report, but I’m not ready to conclude that yet," Stone said. After giving Stone a few more days to track down information, we circled back with him Oct. 31. That’s when he retracted his story -- or rather moved his story to a different county. Stone told PolitiFact Florida that he went back on Jones’ show Oct. 30 to say he was wrong about Snipes meeting with Clinton in Broward. "I was incorrect about that," he said on the radio show. "In fact, I was off by a county. The Clinton entourage pulled up behind the West Palm Beach office of the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections. Hillary Clinton was physically seen by at least three witnesses meeting with officials from the building. These observers were shooed away. ... Palm Beach is of course ground zero of the Democrats’ vote stealing operation." (We sought contact information from Stone for these alleged witnesses but Stone said they were too scared to talk.) Again, the Clinton campaign said no meeting took place -- and Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher also said she didn’t meet with Clinton. It is true that Clinton was in Broward and Palm Beach counties the week that Stone made these claims. She gave speeches at Broward College on Oct. 25 and Palm Beach State College on Oct. 26. During his interview with Jones, Stone tried to portray Snipes as incompetent and pointed to ballots missing the medical marijuana amendment. Stone said that Snipes announced that the amendment "isn’t going to be on the ballot in Broward County because of some kind of a screw up." That’s an exaggeration. The amendment is on the ballot in Broward, but four absentee ballots so far have turned up missing the amendment. A group supporting marijuana legalization sued Snipes over the ballots omitting Amendment 2. On Oct. 28, a Broward judge ruled in Snipes favor and concluded that she had taken appropriate steps to remedy the errors including providing replacement ballots. Our ruling Stone said Clinton showed up in Broward County and slipped into a private meeting with elections supervisor Brenda Snipes. Stone was wrong. He heard it third-hand from Trump supporters who claim they stumbled across such a meeting. Snipes and a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign in Florida denied such a meeting took place and we found no evidence that it did. Days later, Stone admitted he was wrong but then claimed that Clinton met with elections officials in Palm Beach County. He lacks evidence for that claim, too -- and both the elections supervisor and the Clinton campaign deny it.

pomt-12282	France "wouldn’t buy Texas beef for some reason, yet 76 percent of their energy comes from nuclear power."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/jun/30/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-france-wouldnt-import-texas-beef-a/	Rick Perry roused reporters at the White House the other day by taking multiple questions including an inquiry prompting the former governor to make a curious two-part claim about France. Reporter: "Can you assure the American people that nuclear waste and nuclear plant safety are such that we should expand nuclear power in this country?’ U.S. Energy Secretary Perry: "You know, I would reflect that -- or deflect that, if he was here, to President (Emmanuel) Macron of France, who gets 70-plus percent of their power from nuclear energy." "Now," Perry went on, "this is the country that wouldn’t buy Texas beef for some reason, yet 76 percent of their energy comes from nuclear power. So the French, who I’ve always thought were a little bit different -- (laughter) -- and that’s in a good way. You know, they recognized us as a state back in the 1830s, so we actually have a really close, personal relationship with the French. We like them. We had an embassy in Paris. They had one in Austin; as a matter of fact it’s still there, called the French Legation. Invite all of you to come and see it. "But the French are a little different when it comes to some things. And one of those I would find it really interesting -- our French friends are very comfortable getting 76 percent, thereabouts, of their energy from nuclear, and I can assure you they’re very fond of getting it at the rate they’re getting it." Perry was surely referring to France’s official recognition of the Republic of Texas. The country also had a diplomat placed in Austin who intended to live in a building that’s still in place just east of downtown Austin, the French Legation Museum, though that didn’t work out. Perry’s juxtaposition of beef, nuclear power and France made us wonder. That is, have the French refused to buy Texas beef and does France also rely on nuclear power for 76 percent of its energy? Boeuf? After unsuccessfully asking the Energy Department for Perry’s factual backup, we chewed on Perry’s beef beef by reaching Joe Schuele of the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Schuele told us the entire European Union has banned imports of beef produced with growth hormones for nearly three decades. As of 2017, France ranked among the EU’s 28 member- nations. A U.S. Department of Agriculture web page, "Export Requirements for the European Union," presents multiple conditions for animal products shipped to EU countries. A portion states: "All bovine meat exported to the European Union must originate from animals that have never been treated with hormonal growth promotants." Then again, Schuele advised that the EU still imports beef not produced with growth hormones--including about 16,000 metric tons of it, valued at $264 million, in 2016, perhaps some of that making it to France. Mindful that Perry led Texas from late 2000 into 2014, we asked about the timing of the EU’s beef limits. The ban on beef produced with growth hormones, he said, traces to 1989, when the EU was the European Economic Community. That roped off many U.S. beef producers, according to a 2015 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: "In the United States, hormones have been approved for use since the 1950s and are now believed to be used on approximately two-thirds of all cattle and about 90% of the cattle on feedlots. In large U.S. commercial feedlots, their use approaches 100%," the report said. "Cattle producers use hormones because they allow animals to grow larger and more quickly on less feed and fewer other inputs, thus reducing production costs, but also because they produce a leaner carcass more in line with consumer preferences for diets with reduced fat and cholesterol," CRS said. In 2009, years after the U.S. successfully challenged the EU limits before the World Trade Organization, Schuele said, the U.S. and EU agreed to annual quotas of duty-free beef exports. Any beef shipped in excess of the quota, Schuele said, faces a duty amounting to 20 percent of the shipment’s invoiced value on arrival. A USDA spokeswoman, Kari Heerman, separately emailed us similar background, also pointing out the agency’s Non-Hormone Treated Cattle Program, which regulates beef shipped to the EU. Heerman said by email: "France does import beef from the United States, but it does not import beef treated with hormones that are commonly used throughout North America." But, Heerman said, "we do not have data to determine whether/how much of the beef that is exported to France comes from Texas." Heerman said data on "beef flows" or exports from each state aren’t collected. Summing up, Schuele wrote: "So while the EU doesn’t exactly refuse to buy U.S. beef, only a small percentage of U.S. beef is eligible for export to the EU." Nuclear power We turned next to whether 76 percent of France’s power comes from nuclear plants. A web search led us to an International Atomic Energy Agency web page indicating that in 2016, France drew 72 percent of its electricity from 58 nuclear power plants.

pomt-07079	The WIC program "is an incredibly cost effective program, serving nearly 10 million Americans each year and costing less than $100 per person. In my district, more than 18 percent of residents suffer from food insecurity and depend on WIC to make ends meet."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jun/26/david-cicilline/rep-cicilline-says-wic-costs-100-person-and-18-per/	Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline has been arguing against cutbacks in social programs proposed by the Republican majority, a campaign he has highlighted in a YouTube video posted on June 15 and available on his website. It shows him speaking on the floor of the House a day earlier opposing a reduction in funds for the WIC program, which stands for Women, Infants and Children. WIC provides nutritious food to low-income women who are pregnant or have recently delivered a baby, and children under age 5 who might not be getting nutritious meals. "If the majority [Republican] party has their way and denies necessary funding to a critical safety net for some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens, nearly 1,000 women, infants and children in Rhode Island's First District will be denied the assistance they need to survive," said Cicilline. "WIC represents the most basic obligation we have to our fellow citizens most in need -- food and nutrition. On top of that, it's an incredibly cost effective program, serving nearly 10 million Americans each year and costing less than $100 per person. In my district, more than 18 percent of residents suffer from food insecurity and depend on WIC to make ends meet." We wondered whether 18 percent of the residents in the 1st Congressional District were actually on the WIC program, a number that seemed high. It seemed even higher when we considered Cicilline's statement that 10 million Americans are covered by the WIC program -- about 3 percent of the U.S. population. That would mean the people in his district are six times more likely to have WIC coverage than the rest of the country. We were also surprised that the program might be so inexpensive. You can't buy a lot of groceries for $100 a year. So we asked Cicilline's office for the congressman's sources. It didn't take long to discover that the $100 figure was wrong. His staff sent us to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, where staffer Minh Ta said Cicilline had relied on a dollar amount that the caucus had miscalculated. Because the program cost $6.4 billion last year and covered 9.2 million people, the actual amount was nearly $700 per year per person. "Honest mistakes are made," said Ta. Then there's the number of people covered by the program. Rounded properly, the number should be 9 million, not nearly 10 million as Cicilline asserted on the House floor. And what about the statement that "more than 18 percent of residents [in the 1st Congressional District] suffer from food insecurity and depend on WIC to make ends meet"? Last March, the Food Research Action Center (FRAC) in Washington, D.C., analyzed data from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a 2010 survey in which more than 352,000 people -- including 1,396 in Cicilline's district -- were asked: "Have there been times in the past 12 months where you did not have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?" According to FRAC, 18.0 percent of the people in the United States and 18.4 percent in Cicilline's district responded "yes," an indication that they suffered from "food hardship." That matches Cicilline’s "food insecurity" number. But is it really true, as Cicilline asserted, that these people depend on WIC to make ends meet? FRAC said it didn't know how many in the food hardship group were on WIC. So we turned to the Rhode Island Department of Health, which administers the program locally. Spokesman Annemarie Beardsworth said the department didn't have a breakdown of WIC recipients by congressional district because it lists its data by community and Providence is divided between two congressional districts. A total of 9,858 Providence residents receive WIC, some in Cicilline’s district, some in U.S. Rep. James Langevin’s district. Outside of Providence, 10,665 people are covered by WIC in the communities Cicilline represents. Even if we assumed that every WIC recipient in Providence lives in the 1st District, that would total 20,523 people, or 3.9 percent of the 524,000 residents in the 1st District, a far cry from the 18.4 percent cited by Cicilline. If Providence's WIC recipients were evenly divided between Cicilline’s and Langevin's districts, the percentage drops to 3.0 percent. So the percentage cited by Cicilline's was at least four and a half times too high. Katie Vinopal, a policy analyst for FRAC, explained why the number of people with "food hardship" is larger than the number of WIC recipients. The food hardship questions "can be capturing elderly people," she said. "We can be capturing people who can't get on the WIC program [because they're adult males, children over age 4 and women who are not pregnant or new mothers]. We're also capturing people who are income ineligible." For someone to say that people suffering from food insecurity depend on WIC to make ends meet "is not right," said Vinopal. While we were at it, we looked at Cicilline's assertion that the proposed GOP cuts would remove a critical safety net for "nearly 1,000 women, infants and children in Rhode Island's First District." To back that up, the congressman's office sent us a June 8, 2011, news release from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It warned that 200,000 to 350,000 women and young children could lose their WIC benefits next year. In Rhode Island, it said, the estimate ranged from 600 to 1,000. But because the 1st District covers about half the state's residents, the numbers Cicilline quoted for his district should have been closer to 300 to 500. Not only that, the page of the news release that Cicilline's office didn't send us -- we found the original online -- makes it clear that the threat to WIC beneficiaries isn't just from the proposed Republican cuts. It's also from rising food costs. The low national estimate of 200,000 presumes a 2-percent rise in prices; the high estimate of 350,000 assumes a 5-percent increase. We asked Zoe Neuberger, coauthor of the center’s study, whether budget cuts or projected food price increases played the biggest role. She said that, based on the information at the time Cicilline made his comment, if the Republican cuts were approved and food prices did not increase, 150,000 low-income women and children will lose their food assistance. So the direct effect of the proposed Republican cuts in Cicilline's district extrapolated to about 225 women and children, not 1,000. Food price increases would account for another 75 to 275 cases. The day after we heard from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Cicilline spokewoman Jessica Kershaw wrote us to report that the congressman had misspoke when he said 1,000 would be affected. "He meant to say that those 1,000 Rhode Islanders could be from across the state -- not just his district," she wrote. "What’s most important -- and what the Congressman sought to stress in his remarks -- is that there are too many people who are going hungry and cannot afford enough food for their household and he strongly opposes cuts to programs that benefit the people who need those programs the most," Kershaw said. That's the message behind Cicilline’s statement. We certainly understand that people going hungry because they can’t afford food is a serious problem. But the bottom line is that Cicilline, in making an impassioned argument for a program meant to address the issue got most of the checkable facts in the statement wrong. Eighteen percent of the people in his district do not depend on WIC to make ends meet -- it's no higher than 3.9 percent. The cost of the WIC program is not $100 per recipient per year -- it's closer to $700. The number of Americans covered by the program isn't nearly 10 million -- it's closer to 9 million -- a relatively small error, but wrong, nonetheless. And if the GOP cuts were to take effect, the number of people affected in his district wouldn't be close to 1,000 -- it would be more like 225. They say that two wrongs don't make a right. We say that this many Falses in 46 seconds warrants a Pants On Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-06917	"A clause hidden in the Obamacare bill, which is now law, gives Obama the right to form a private army."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/22/victoria-jackson/victoria-jackson-column-claims-health-care-law-giv/	If you thought that comparing President Barack Obama to Adolph Hitler was just a passing fad, you should know the trend lives on at the website WorldNetDaily. Comedian Victoria Jackson, a Saturday Night Live alum and tea party supporter, recently penned a column titled, "The 3 scariest things about Obama." Jackson is a regular WorldNetDaily columnist and is slated to attend the WND Tea Party at Sea cruise of Alaska later this summer. To quote the piece, the three scary things are "private army (like Hitler), socialist (like Hitler), media control (like Hitler)." She continues: "A clause hidden in the Obamacare bill, which is now law, gives Obama the right to form a private army. Why isn't anyone freaking out?" A reader sent us the column, published July 15, 2011, and asked us to fact-check it. Given Jackson's background as a comedian, we wondered if it was a joke. We concluded that it wasn't, and we're treating it here as a serious claim. Jackson backs up her points with YouTube videos of segments from Fox News. Her claim that Obama has the right to form a private army is based on a 2010 appearance of Fox analyst Andrew Napolitano, who discussed the health care law with Fox News anchor Shepard Smith. We're not sure of the exact date of the interview, but it was posted to YouTube on May 3, 2010, just months after final passage of the health care law. "By referring to it as a reserve corps, and the training is the same as the regular corps, it gives you the impression that the president has the power to take over the National Guard from state governors in peace time. Now under the Constitution, he can't do that. But a fair reading of this legislation would let him do it," Napolitano said. "Another way to read this legislation is that these are health care professionals, but they're going to train with the military, meaning they would carry sidearms," Napolitano said. Napolitano hedges his provocative claims by saying that the legislation raises many questions. "We don't know how this is going to be implemented; the language is intentionally vague." But he called the use of the military language "scary." We turned to the text of the bill to see if it said anything about the National Guard or about health care professionals training with the military. It didn't. Instead, the sliver of evidence for the claim is that the U.S. Public Health Service uses military terms to organize its Commissioned Corps, a uniformed group of 6,500 health professionals. The military-like organization dates back to 1871 and comes from the Commissioned Corps' work with Marine hospitals stationed along coastal and inland waterways. (It's also why the Surgeon General is called the Surgeon General.) Today, teams of Commissioned Corps officers often work with the military on humanitarian missions, and some serve on U.S. Navy hospital ships. In recent years, the Commisioned Corps' emergency response teams have responded to hurricanes hitting the Gulf Coast and international incidents like the earthquake in Haiti. But the Commissioned Corps is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, not the U.S. military. Likewise, the new "Ready Reserve Corps" will be part of HHS, and not part of the military. The text of the health care law says plainly, "The purpose of the Ready Reserve Corps is to fulfill the need to have additional Commissioned Corps personnel available on short notice (similar to the uniformed service's reserve program) to assist regular Commissioned Corps personnel to meet both routine public health and emergency response missions." The Public Health Service explains the new initiative similarly: "The purpose of the Ready Reserve Corps is to have additional Commissioned Corps personnel available on short notice (similar to the other uniformed services' reserve programs) to assist full time Commissioned Corps personnel to meet both routine public health and emergency response missions. Prior to the passage of the new law, the USPHS Commissioned Corps did not have a reserve component to call upon in this fashion. The Ready Reserve Corps members perform duties for assigned periods of time as opposed to full time Corps members who are on extended active duty. Joining the Ready Reserve Corps is voluntary; however, members of the Ready Reserve Corps join knowing that they can be called at anytime to serve in times of national need." Out of an abundance of caution, we contacted James Parascandola, who served as the Public Health Service historian from 1992 to 2004. He confirmed that the Commissioned Corps and the Ready Reserve Corps are uniformed health officials. "They don't train with the military, and they don't carry weapons," he said. They sometimes work with the military, but they do so as medical personnel, not as a private army. Jackson said that the health care law gives Obama "the right to form a private army." We don't find that to be the case, and her source, Andrew Napolitano, seems to be making up interpretations of the health care law that have no basis in reality. The Ready Reserve Corps created by the law would be part of a long-established uniformed team of health care professionals that are part of the Department of Health and Human Services, not the military. They don't carry sidearms, and they don't have military training. If this is Obama's army, it's an army armed with tongue depressors and stethoscopes.

pomt-13644	"We know this now. The banks no longer loan (Donald Trump) money because he's a terrible risk. So he goes to these (Russian) oligarchs and borrows money."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/aug/08/anthony-weiner/anthony-weiner-lacks-collateral-claim-about-donald/	Donald Trump's relationship with Russia has become an issue because of several factors: his campaign's ties in the region; the claim that the leaks of Democratic National Committee email originated from Russian hackers; Trump's conflicting claims about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin; and Trump's invitation to the Russians to hack Hillary's Clinton's emails. Former Democratic U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner discussed Trump's Russian ties on the July 27, 2016, edition of Real Time with Bill Maher. (Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, a Clinton top adviser. Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 after a sexting scandal.) "The reason he loves Putin, we know this now. The banks no longer loan him money because he's a terrible risk. So he goes to these (Russian) oligarchs and borrows money. He knows the end game is coming for him. He's thinking about who he wants to ingratiate himself (with). We have a presidential candidate who is literally kind of approaching Russia on his knees because he needs them to loan him money." Banks are no longer loaning Trump money, and Trump is trying to get it from Russian oligarchs? When we contacted Weiner, he characterized his comment as "informed speculation among real estate builders and bankers. There is some transparency on lending for buildings. But since he hasn’t really built anything since the Soho Grand, there isn’t much to look at. The part about him being a terrible risk is borne out by his record of not paying debts." So we went looking for some evidence on the question of who is lending Trump money. Hard evidence is lacking because Trump runs a private business, so most of his records are not available to the public. In addition, he has repeatedly refused to release any recent tax returns, which could be another indication of his source of capital. We sought out what's available. No loans for Trump? The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2016 that the candidate's available financial statements show that the struggling German bank Deutsche Bank "is the only bank with a big Wall Street presence that continues to lend to him." Other large institutions do little if any business with Trump, the newspaper reported, but smaller institutions do. The Journal said "many big banks have shunned him," but the paper also reported that Trump has few loans with big banks. "Bankers say that's partly because Mr. Trump has moved away from developing multimillion-dollar real-estate projects to managing them and licensing the Trump name, reducing his need to borrow." Daughter Ivanka told the Journal that the big banks are not wary of investing with Trump: "The biggest banking institutions are constantly soliciting us. But we don't need a lot of financing because we have a great balance sheet and a tremendous amount of cash." In addition, she said, Trump has moved to private banks that have lower interest rates. Nonetheless, various media outlets have stated, without offering any documentation, that Trump can't get funds from most banks. From Slate: "After his 2004 bankruptcy and his long streak of lawsuits, the big banks decided he wasn’t worth the effort. They’d rather not touch the self-proclaimed 'king of debt.' " From Talking Points Memo: "Trump has been blackballed by all major US banks." For his part, Weiner pointed us to an Aug. 2 commentary posted on Time.com, which reported that "the real truth is that, as major banks in America stopped lending him money following his many bankruptcies, the Trump organization was forced to seek financing from non-traditional institutions. Several had direct ties to Russian financial interests in ways that have raised eyebrows." Which leads us to the Russian part of Weiner's claim. Loans from oligarchs? Weiner also sent us a Politico article explaining how Trump has tried to get Russians as tenants and buyers for his various properties, including a 17-bedroom mansion in Palm Beach, which he bought in bankruptcy for $41 million in 2004. He eventually sold the property to a Russian oligarch for $95 million in 2008. But that was a property sale. Weiner was talking about getting loans from oligarchs, a very different thing. Other media outlets have reported that Trump has actively marketed condo projects to Russians, particularly Russians with money to burn — or hide. Politico reported that when it came to the Palm Beach property Trump sold to oligarch billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, Rybolovlev has probably never been in the house. He subsequently denied owning it and preparations are underway to tear it down. This may explain why, at a real estate conference in 2008, Donald Trump Jr., the candidate's son, said that "Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia." But the issue for this fact-check is borrowing money, and we couldn't find any evidence that Trump has been getting loans from any oligarchs. The few cases we found involved Trump partnering with people with ties to the region. Trump has been looking for business opportunities in the Soviet Union since at least 1987, when he flew there to try to develop luxury hotels in Moscow and Leningrad. None of the real estate deals ever led to a groundbreaking. Russian involvement in financing deals seems to be coming indirectly. The best-known example is a company that Trump partnered with for hotel-condominium projects — one in Toronto, the other in Lower Manhattan known as Trump SoHo. The company that partnered with Trump is the Bayrock Group, chaired by former Soviet official Tevfik Arif, who hails from Kazakhstan. Bayrock has drawn attention for a host of reasons. First, one of its prominent associates is Felix Satter (later changed to Sater), a Russian immigrant with an office in Trump Tower in New York. Satter served time beginning in 1993 for slashing a man's face in a barroom brawl and, in a lawsuit, was accused of threatening to electrocute the testicles of a Trump investor, according to Slate. In addition, Satter was "implicated in a huge stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals," according to the New York Times. He later became an FBI informant. Second, when the company's finance director, Jody Kriss, sued Bayrock for fraud, Kriss alleged that the company, founded in 1989 in Moscow, was "backed by oligarchs and money they stole from the Russian people." According to that lawsuit, "Month after month for two years, ... whenever Bayrock ran out of cash, Bayrock Holdings would magically show up with a wire from ‘somewhere’ just large enough to keep the company going." Also feeding into the pot of Bayrock money was a fund called the FL Group. Kriss' lawsuit says it attracted Russian investors "in favor with Putin." It chipped in $50 million in 2007, which became controversial after the $50 million partnership deal was re-classified as a loan, a move of questionable legality because it seemed to be designed to avoid U.S. taxes, according to the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph. This may seem far removed from Trump, but the Telegraph reported that Trump signed off on that deal. According to the paper, Alan Garten, Trump’s lawyer, claimed that the billionaire had simply signed letters acknowledging the deal as a "limited partner" with Bayrock. The Kriss suit, while claiming that "tax evasion and money-laundering are the core of Bayrock’s business model," also says, "There is no evidence (Donald) Trump took any part in, or knew of, their racketeering. Any contrary inference would be unjust." (Editor’s note, Aug. 16, 2016: After we published our fact-check, we received a response from a representative for Bayrock, which said, "The allegations made by Jody Kriss are baseless and unsubstantiated.") The Trump campaign declined to comment when we inquired about Weiner's statement. Our ruling Weiner said of Trump, "We know this now. The banks no longer loan him money because he's a terrible risk. So he goes to these oligarchs and borrows money." Weiner called it "informed speculation." But at PolitiFact, we operate on the principle that the person making the claim is responsible for providing evidence. In this case the evidence is lacking, in part because Trump has revealed so little. Even his net worth remains a mystery. Nonetheless, records show that banks are still loaning money to him, albeit not the big U.S. institutions. There's no evidence to prove that it's because the large banks have shut him out. Similarly, there's little evidence to show that Trump has been seeking loans from oligarchs instead of financial institutions. There's circumstantial evidence that oligarchs have been involved in his business dealings, but mostly through intermediary companies that own a financial stake in his projects. That's different from a direct loan. Because the statement seems to contain some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/749a7984-1f65-451f-996f-cfb469302219	None	Anthony Weiner	None	None	None	2016-08-08T12:00:00	2016-07-27	['Russia', 'Donald_Trump']
pomt-07362	On the night of the Iowa caucuses, Obama "promised the nation that he would do health care reform focused on cost containment, he opposed an individual mandate, and he said he was going to do it with Republicans."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/06/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-quotes-obamas-words-health-care-iowa-/	Tim Pawlenty had the chance to attack Mitt Romney's 2002 Massachusetts health care plan at a debate for Republican presidential candidates on the Fox News Channel on May 5, 2011. Pawlenty attended the debate; Romney didn't. Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, opted instead to attack President Barack Obama's health care plan, calling the new law "a top-down, government-run, centralized, limited choice, limited option system." "President Obama stood in Iowa in 2008 on the night of the Iowa caucuses and he promised the nation that he would do health care reform focused on cost containment, he opposed an individual mandate, and he said he was going to do it with Republicans. He broke that promise," Pawlenty said. We've investigated the charge that the law is a "government takeover" of health care and rated it False. (In fact, it was our 2010 Lie of the Year.) The health care law does dramatically increase federal regulation of health insurance, but it leaves in place private insurance and private health care providers. Some have said the plan is the same as the one Romney supported in Massachusetts back in 2002, a claim we've rated Mostly True. The federal law isn't an exact copy, but it's very similar. At the debate, the moderator described the Massachusetts plan and then asked Pawlenty, "A poll just weeks ago showed that 84 percent of Massachusetts residents are satisfied with the plan. Why isn't that good enough for you?" Pawlenty didn't directly answer the question, instead opting to attack Obama's plan. Here, we were interested in checking Pawlenty's statement about what Obama said on the night of the Iowa caucuses, that he "promised the nation that he would do health care reform focused on cost containment, he opposed an individual mandate, and he said he was going to do it with Republicans." We wondered if that was accurate or if Pawlenty was putting words in Obama's mouth. We found a copy of Obama's comments and identified the brief yet relevant passage. Here's what Obama said: "I'll be a president who finally makes health care affordable and available to every single American, the same way I expanded health care in Illinois, by bringing Democrats and Republicans together to get the job done." Let's take this piece by piece: Obama "said he was going to do it with Republicans." Indeed, Obama said he would bring the parties together "to get the job done." It's also clear he did not succeed at that. The final health care law passed without a single Republican vote, and a few Democrats even crossed over to vote against the bill. (One Republican House member did vote for an early version of the bill, but not the final version.) Some Obama supporters have argued that he tried to work with Republicans -- debate on the bill dragged on for more than a year -- but was unsuccessful. Whatever the reasons, the bottom line is, yes, Obama said he'd enlist Republicans, but no, it didn't happen. We'd rate this point True. Obama said he "opposed an individual mandate." You may not remember this, but we sure do: Obama opposed requiring people to buy health insurance, a point that was endlessly debated in the 2008 Democratic primaries. Obama's plan did not include a mandate; plans from candidates Hillary Clinton and John Edwards did. "I believe the problem is not that folks are trying to avoid getting health care. The problem is they can't afford it. And that's why my plan emphasizes lowering costs," Obama said back then. The night of the Iowa caucuses, Obama said he wanted to make health "available" to all Americans. Given all the discussion of the mandate back them, it seems that was an allusion to his opposition to the mandate. As actual legislation was being developed in 2009, however, Obama changed his mind about the individual mandate and accepted it. We rated his change of heart a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter. Obama said he was willing to accept it as long as it included a hardship exemption. The individual mandate works by imposing fines on people who don't have insurance. If people can't find affordable insurance to buy, as measured by a percentage of income, they would qualify for the exemption. On this one, Obama didn't mention an individual mandate explicitly on the night of the caucuses. But he seemed to allude to it, and it was widely known to be his position. He later changed on that, and the final bill did include a mandate. We'd rate this point by Pawlenty Mostly True. Obama said "he would do health care reform focused on cost containment." On the night of the Iowa caucuses, Obama didn't say he would focus on cost containment; he said he would make health care "affordable and available." It's not exactly the same thing. But then we pulled up our old copy of Obama's health care plan, and it reminded us of how much it emphasized cost containment. Pawlenty argues that Obama's plan doesn't focus on cost containment; Obama would no doubt disagree. In our analysis of the health care plan, we've noted that it does include a variety of measures aimed at containing costs, but there's uncertainty as to how well these measures will work in the coming years. According to official projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, people will see different amounts of cost savings, depending on what kind of insurance they have. Finally, officials in Massachusetts are still working on containing costs. So this point is a bit murkier, and we'd rate it Half True. Pawlenty claims that Obama broke his promises. It's clear that Obama didn't get Republican votes for health care, and he reversed himself on opposing an individual mandate. The jury's still out on cost containment. However, we have been tracking a campaign promise of Obama's to "cut the cost of a typical family's health insurance premium by up to $2,500 a year." We've rated that promise Stalled, because premiums are not projected to decrease in the coming years. There's a bit of uncertainty there, however, as it will be several years before the health care law is fully implemented. Overall, we rate Pawlenty's statement Mostly True.

pomt-01873	Says Alison Lundergan Grimes "supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors’ Medicare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/10/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-opponent-alison-lundergan-grimes-support/	One of Republicans’ favorite Affordable Care Act talking points is back in fashion. Back in 2012, we checked the claim that the health care law cuts $700 billion from Medicare more times than we can count. (For a sample, look here, here and here.) It’s popped up again in this year’s Senate race in Kentucky. Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes recently accused incumbent Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of supporting a $6,000 per year increase in Medicare costs for beneficiaries -- another once-popular claim resurfacing. We’ve rated that False. The McConnell campaign swiftly retaliated with an ad of its own the next day. "The truth? Grimes supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors’ Medicare. That’s how Obama and Grimes will pay for Obamacare," the ad says. For old times’ sake, we decided to look into the claim once again. The $700 billion 'cuts' The Affordable Care Act is projected to reduce federal spending on Medicare by about $716 billion between 2013 and 2022, but it does not literally cut funding from the program or reduce its overall budget. In fact, spending will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. The Affordable Care Act just slows its growth, instituting a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. The spending reductions fall largely on insurance companies and hospitals, not seniors. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. The program, started under President George W. Bush, has cost more than expected -- and more than traditional Medicare. Hospitals will also be paid less if they have too many readmissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Also, the $716 billion in reductions is not really being used to "pay for" the law, as McConnell said. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to federal budget deficits. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending over a period of about 10 years. Some of the new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. Does Grimes support the Affordable Care Act? When the law was enacted in 2010, Grimes was working as an attorney in Lexington, Ky., and played no role in the Affordable Care Act debate. But she hasn’t been able to avoid questions about her stance on the law this election cycle. Since the start of her campaign, Grimes has said she is troubled by certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. She has also said the solution is to improve on the law, rather than to throw it out completely. She’s spoken positively of 640,000 Kentuckians who were previously uninsured and will now be able to get insurance. It’s a bit harder to pin down her position on the Medicare spending reductions specifically. At the 2013 Kentucky State Fair, a reporter from the Louisville television station WHAS 11 asked Grimes if she agreed with Republicans that the Affordable Care Act would hurt senior citizens. "I’m troubled with certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act," she said. "But we're here at the State Fair, and if there's three reasons why Kentuckians, especially our seniors, need access to affordable health care coverage, you just have to look over to the right where you see the donut burger, the chili cheese steak and the covered French fries." We should note that the 2012 Republican budget championed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also trimmed future Medicare spending by almost exactly the same amount as the health care law. (And McConnell voted to consider Ryan’s plan that May.) Our ruling An ad out of the McConnell campaign said, "Grimes supports Obamacare, which cuts $700 billion from seniors’ Medicare." Grimes has been cautiously supportive of the Affordable Care Act, and she certainly does not oppose it as strongly as McConnell does. The law is projected to reduce spending on Medicare by about $700 billion over 10 years, but those reductions in spending are more of a slowed growth rate rather than a budget cut.

pomt-09850	Obama's plan for health care reform "ends exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/14/david-axelrod/reform-plan-caps-out-pocket-expenses/	The White House is fighting chain e-mails with chain e-mails. After spending days responding to inaccurate e-mails about the health care reform plan, the White House responded with its own e-mail from David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. The subject line was "Something worth forwarding." Axelrod began his e-mail with a list of ways that reform provides "security and stability to those with or without coverage." One of his claims is that refom "ends exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays: Insurance companies will have to abide by yearly caps on how much they can charge for out-of-pocket expenses." We recognize that "exorbitant" is subjective, but we thought it would be helpful to research whether Axelrod is right that the plan limits charges that a typical person or family would find excessive. The main health care reform bill in Congress does set annual limits on out-of-pocket expenses. That means there's a cap on what people would have to pay in a year for medical costs. And insurance companies won't be allowed to require patients to pay for preventive treatments such as check-ups. In the House legislation, outlined in section 122, the annual cap on out-of-pocket expenses is $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family. Those numbers are indexed for inflation. The policy would be phased in. Employer-provided policies would have a grace period of five years, as outlined in section 102, before they are required to comply with the caps. If you get a new individual policy through the health care exchange, it would have to comply right away. We asked Sara Collins of the Commonwealth Fund about the caps. The Commonwealth Fund is a nonpartisan private foundation that advocates for a better health care system. She said the caps are a good form of consumer protection. Axelrod is correct that the main health care reform bill requires insurance companies to "abide by yearly caps on how much they can charge for out-of-pocket expenses." But ending "exorbitant" out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays? 'Exorbitant' may be in the eye of the beholder. For a family, $10,000 in the course of a year can be a serious financial hit. (The median income for a family of four is $67,000.) Still, the new limits are better than nothing, and health care advocates praise them as an important safeguard for consumers. So we rate Axelrod's statement Mostly True.	None	David Axelrod	None	None	None	2009-08-14T18:27:34	2009-08-13	['None']
pomt-10633	"We haven't built a refinery, I think, in 30 years."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/10/rudy-giuliani/capacity-has-increased/	When it comes to energy independence, the United States has "an idea" but lacks "a program," according to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. During the Jan. 5 debates in Manchester, N.H., he said, "We haven't built a refinery, I think, in 30 years." It's been more than 30 years, said Bill Holbrook, communications director for the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association, an industry trade group. The last spanking-new refinery built in the United States was the Marathon Oil refinery in Garyville, La., in 1976. But that's not the whole story, he said. "When people say that, they're implying that the industry has done nothing to increase capacity," Holbrook complained. "And that is inaccurate." The industry has found it costs less money and takes less time to expand existing facilities, he said. Over the past 15 years, the U.S. refining industry has added the equivalent of one new, state-of-the-art refinery a year, each with a capacity to refine 150,000 to 300,000 barrels per day. Jonathan Cogan, senior analyst with the Energy Information Administration, echoed Holbrook: "Not quibbling with the wording, but it leads you to believe we haven't increased our refining capacity. We have." In fact, the United States has added nearly 1.7-million barrels per day of refining capacity since 1985, according to the administration's records. Cogan said Garyville is the last "significant" refinery built, and industry experts often think of it as the most recent. But there have been a handful of smaller refineries built since then. However, those can handle only a fraction of Garyville's capacity, according to the EIA, the information arm of the Department of Energy. So Giuliani has the date right, but tells only part of the story. No significant refineries have been built in more than 30 years, but refining capacity in the United States has expanded substantially and smaller plants have been built. We rule his statement Barely True. UPDATE: The last new refinery of significant size built in the United States was a Marathon Oil refinery in Garyville, La. Previously, we reported an incorrect name for the facility. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2008-01-10T00:00:00	2008-01-05	['None']
pomt-07332	"The substitute budget now adds in tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy these prisons."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/may/12/matt-lundy/state-rep-matt-lundy-says-house-gop-added-extra-ta/	Gov. John Kasich’s wish to sell off six state prisons has become yet another partisan political hot potato in Columbus. Then again, what isn’t during budget season. But state Rep. Matt Lundy, an Elyria Democrat, kicked it up a notch with comments during a May 2 news conference called for the purpose of throwing cold water on the Republican governor’s plan to sell off five adult prison facilities and one youth detention center. Kasich has said the transaction could net Ohio a profit of $200 million. Lundy disagrees. He argues that there still will be bonds and improvement debts to be serviced and that will cut into the profit. He likened the proposal to an "insane yard sale" and questioned the logic of selling state assets during a down economic period when they may fetch low bids. He also accused Republicans in control of the House of helping Kasich to lure buyers. "The substitute budget now adds in tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy these prisons," Lundy said. The House passed its version of the budget on May 5. Politifact Ohio decided to take a closer look. The House did propose a sales tax exemption, income tax deduction and commercial tax exclusion for any buyer that strikes a deal with Ohio to take over the prisons offered for sale. Lundy said such friendly trinkets will eat away at the state’s expect profits on the deal. So, why was it included? Kasich’s proposal didn’t offer the tax breaks but the House Republicans did. House Finance Chairman Ron Amstutz, a Wooster Republican, said the tax provisions were added to assure that the private buyer of the prisons would be treated like any other state entity since they will essentially be performing a state function by housing inmates. "Typically state entities don’t pay taxes on their functions and that is true of local governments, as well," Amstutz said. "And I think the desire is to maintain that status in order to provide for services at the lowest cost that we can." If the private entities were to pay these particular taxes, which go back to supporting the local communities where the facilities are located, then "basically the state taxpayers would be subsidizing the local taxpayers at that point for a state function and typically we don’t do that," Amstutz explained. State prisons spokesman Carlo LoParo noted, however, that any buyer of the state prisons would be expected to pay property taxes each year, which would net a huge amount of cash for the local governments where there facilities are located. "That’s pretty substantial," LoParo said. He added that the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections had closely monitored the House negotiations to make sure that a carve out for property taxes was not stuck in. "We took pains to make sure there were no loopholes," he said. "We fully expect them to pay property taxes to those communities where the prisons are located." The impact for local governments could be substantial. For example, there are two facilities offered for sale that are in Marion -- the North Central Correctional Institution that houses adults and the Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility, which is currently closed. Combined, the two properties are valued at $100 million, which would result in about $1.5 million annually in property tax collections for that small city. LoParo said that should be enough money help Marion’s police force pick up criminal investigations at the two facilities, which would fall to the city and not state highway patrol, as is currently the case. So where does Lundy land on the Truth-O-Meter. Lundy is correct that the the substitute budget includes tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy the prisons. There would be no sales tax on the purchase and there are other exclusions for income and commercial taxes. The administration is demanding that local property taxes absolutely be paid, which could yield significant revenue to local governments and schools. And Lundy is correct that the tax breaks and deductions in the budget bill were added in by the House. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Lundy’s comment as True.

pomt-06081	"Bob Menendez just voted to increase the government's debt ceiling to $1.9 TRILLION! In his 19 years in Congress, Menendez has helped overspend America over $15 TRILLION into debt."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/08/anna-little/bob-menendez-attacked-potential-gop-challenger-ove/	Republican Anna Little wants to kick U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez out of office this year, but she doesn’t seem to know much about the Democratic senator’s record when it comes to increasing the federal debt. On her campaign website -- "Little for Senate" -- the former Monmouth County freeholder sounded the alarm about Menendez’s spending habits with a message entitled "Stop Debt! Stop Bob Menendez!" "Bob Menendez just voted to increase the government's debt ceiling to $1.9 TRILLION! In his 19 years in Congress, Menendez has helped overspend America over $15 TRILLION into debt," the message continued. "Who will pay? Your children? Your grandchildren? Menendez doesn't seem to care." After reviewing Menendez’s voting records, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Little’s statement is far from the truth. The senator voted against the most recent debt ceiling increase and he has opposed some of the legislation that experts say contributed to the rising federal debt. However, Menendez has voted for other bills -- such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus) -- that helped put the nation in greater debt. Menendez served as a congressman between 1993 and 2006, when he joined the Senate. Larry Cirignano, Little’s campaign manager, acknowledged that the message should not have said Menendez just voted for a debt ceiling increase, but he maintained that Menendez is "spending money we don’t have." Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said the senator has always taken the nation’s deficit seriously, but he believes the issue must be addressed in a way that protects the middle class and "asks the wealthiest Americans and big corporations to pay their fair share." First, let’s explain the most recent debt ceiling increase. In early August, President Barack Obama and Congress reached an agreement to raise the nation’s debt ceiling by up to $2.4 trillion for a new limit of about $16.6 trillion. But Menendez voted against that deal. The senator supported a previous debt ceiling increase of $1.9 trillion, but that vote occurred about two years ago. Little’s statement claims Menendez "just voted" for a debt ceiling increase, giving readers the impression that she is referring to the most recent increase. Now, let’s turn to Little’s other claim that "Menendez has helped overspend America over $15 TRILLION into debt." The total federal debt has exceeded $15 trillion, the result of military conflicts, legislative actions and overall economic conditions. We focused on Menendez’s voting record in regard to previous debt ceiling adjustments and certain legislation that contributed to the higher debt. In both categories, Menendez comes away with a mixed record. Before the most recent debt ceiling deal, there were 16 debt limit adjustments during Menendez’s tenure. Menendez supported 11 of those measures, and rejected five. The nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative in April identified various legislative actions that contributed to debt increases between 2001 and 2011. Those changes include tax cuts enacted in 2001, 2003 and December 2010; the Medicare Part D program; and the stimulus. Of those five examples, Menendez voted against three of them -- the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003; and the Medicare Part D program. But he supported the stimulus bill and the December 2010 tax legislation. Two experts we contacted also pointed out how the weak economy contributed to the higher debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits. Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, added in an email: "But one of the largest single factors has been the economic downturn, which is difficult to assign blame for." Our ruling On her campaign website, Little claimed Menendez "just voted" for a debt ceiling increase and that he "has helped overspend America over $15 TRILLION into debt." But Menendez voted against the most recent debt ceiling increase, and he has a mixed record in regard to past legislative actions that contributed to the higher debt. For example, he rejected tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, but supported the stimulus bill in 2009 and tax cuts in December 2010. We rate the statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02516	Says that as a U.S. senator, Scott Brown "delivered for Wall Street, saving big banks $19 billion in taxes."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/feb/11/senate-majority-pac/pro-democratic-pac-says-scott-brown-delivered-wall/	Republican Scott Brown hasn’t tipped his hat about whether he’ll run for office in New Hampshire, but the buzz about Brown hasn’t died down in the Granite State. One poll conducted in January 2014 showed Brown tied in a hypothetical match-up against U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who faces re-election in the fall. Other polls have him trailing Shaheen by 10 points and 3 points, but within striking distance. Political groups have filled the airwaves with messages aimed at swaying the Senate race. Shaheen has been targeted for her support of President Barack Obama’s health care reform law. Meanwhile, Brown came under attack from a committee aimed at keeping Democrats in charge of the Senate. An ad released by Senate Majority PAC in January 2014 painted the former Massachusetts senator as a friend of big banks. "When Scott Brown was the senator from Massachusetts, the Boston Globe reports, he delivered for Wall Street, saving big banks $19 billion in taxes," the ad states. The claim has been picked up elsewhere, with the New Hampshire Democratic party posting on its Buzzfeed page an item titled, "10 things Scott Brown thinks are no biggie." One of the items cited in the post was that "Brown delivered a $19 billion break for his Wall Street pals." We wondered whether it was true that Brown delivered a tax break for big banks while he was serving in the U.S. Senate. If so, how big was it? We asked Senate Majority PAC to help us evaluate the claim, but we didn’t get a response. Next, we looked to the Globe, the newspaper of record in Brown’s former home state. The Globe did indeed report that Brown "delivered for Wall Street" while he was in the Senate. A story published in 2012 highlighted Brown’s role in the battle over the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a bill to overhaul financial regulation that was signed in 2010. Brown withheld his support for the bill until Democrats agreed to eliminate a proposed $19 billion tax on banks, the Globe reported. Brown’s own statements from the time jibe with the Globe’s reporting; Brown opposed the $19 billion tax proposal. Furthermore, his intransigence played a part in getting the tax dropped from the final bill, according to multiple reports. But to evaluate whether Brown delivered a political favor for Wall Street -- the underlying message of the attack ad -- it’s important to consider the context of the Dodd-Frank bill, and its full impact on the financial services industry. Brown crossed party lines Dodd-Frank was crafted in response to the financial collapse that began in 2007. It was designed as a sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system, intended to increase oversight and prevent the risky practices that contributed to the economic crisis. Brown was one of the only Republicans in the Senate who supported the bill. His vote was crucial to getting the legislation signed into law, delivering a victory for Obama and supporters in Congress who were pushing for regulatory changes. "I was the deciding vote on the Dodd-Frank bill," Brown told PolitiFact New Hampshire. "I was tired of banks acting like casinos with our money." Brown was hailed for supporting the bill by then-Sen. Chris Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, who called his actions an example of how bipartisanship is supposed to work. Obama also thanked Brown and the two other Senate Republicans who voted in favor of Dodd-Frank. During an interview this week, Brown pointed out that Shaheen and nearly every other Senate Democrat joined him in voting for passage. Brown said he faced blowback from Republicans, and is still criticized by Tea Party conservatives for supporting the bill. "If Jeanne and the Democrats are so upset over it, then why did they vote for it?" he said. Financial companies face fees Although Brown lobbied against one form of taxation, the bill had other ramifications for big banks. When Dodd-Frank was being hammered out in committee, lawmakers received a projection from the Congressional Budget Office that showed one version of the bill was on track to increase budget deficits by $19.7 billion over a decade. Because of federal pay-as-you-go requirements, lawmakers needed to find some way to pay for the deficit increase. Members of the conference committee sought to make up the difference by taxing certain large financial institutions to the tune of $19 billion -- a roughly equal amount. Since Brown’s support was crucial to getting the bill through the Senate, he did play a significant role in getting the $19 billion tax eliminated. Brown asked members of the conference committee to reduce federal spending instead. "This tax will be paid by consumers who will have to pay higher fees and the small businesses that won't get the funding they need to invest and create jobs," Brown wrote in a June 29, 2010 letter to Dodd and then-U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. The solution that emerged used a combination of measures to offset the anticipated deficit increase. It redirected $11 billion by shutting down the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the fund established after the financial collapse to rescue banks such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America. Much of the remainder of the money came by requiring the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to charge higher deposit insurance premiums. The change applied only to banks with assets greater than $10 billion. The compromise won Brown’s support, but it didn’t sit well with some in the financial services industry. Jim Chessen, the chief economist at the American Bankers Association, called the new FDIC requirements a "tax by another name" in a June 30, 2010 report from American Banker. James Barth, a scholar in finance at Auburn University and a senior fellow at the Milken Institute, agreed the deposit insurance changes were essentially a new tax on banks. "You can do it indirectly through the Deposit Insurance Fund or you can do it directly and call it a tax, but you've heard the old analogy: If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck," he told American Banker. The net impact Brown helped to thwart one tax increase, but Dodd-Frank still instituted other fees on the financial industry. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the higher FDIC premiums that came about through Dodd-Frank will save the government about $6 billion over 10 years by taking in more money from big banks. The bill also changed federal deposit insurance programs in ways unrelated to the compromise struck to appease Brown and other Senate Republicans. One of those changes raised deposit insurance coverage levels. It was expected to yield about $9 billion in savings -- money that would come through corresponding increases in premiums paid by depository institutions. Another fee on financial companies came through changes to the Federal Reserve. Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve to charge fees for the examination of large thrift and bank holding companies, a move expected to increase revenues by about $580 million over 10 years. Dodd-Frank also established several new regulatory entities. Among them were the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research. Both entities were slated to be funded for two years by transfers from the Federal Reserve, then through fees assessed on certain financial companies totalling $500 million. In all, those new fees and taxes on big banks calculate to around $16 billion. The actual amount could be far higher; in a blog post in 2011, the American Bankers Association wrote that Dodd-Frank is "likely to result in nearly $27 billion in new private-sector fees, assessments and premiums." Our ruling Brown might have "delivered" for Wall Street by opposing a specific $19 billion tax proposal that would have been part of Dodd-Frank, but his support for the law -- which proved pivotal for its passage, and which drew Brown significant flak from the financial-services industry -- still helped bring about billions worth of new taxes and fees on the financial sector, not to mention additional regulation. The claim has an element of truth, but ignores important details that would give a different impression. So we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00107	Says Andrew Gillum was "singing a different tune" about charter schools at the Florida debate.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/oct/29/ron-desantis/does-andrew-gillum-want-get-rid-charter-schools-fl/	Ron DeSantis accused Andrew Gillum of changing his message to Florida voters about his plans for the future of charter schools. At their final debate, moderator Todd McDermott asked Gillum to elaborate on his charter school plan. "You’ve said ‘we’ve got to end this for-profit education’ in reference to charter schools in this state," McDermott said. "Ten percent of students in Florida attend charter schools that provide an alternative to traditional public education. Are you saying you would cut any dollars away from what funds charter schools in the state?" Gillum replied, "No, I am not proposing any change to the current status quo. But what we are saying is that we are going to put money into our public system where over 90 percent of our kids are still being educated." DeSantis accused Gillum of "singing a different tune." "In the Democratic primary, he said that charter schools would be done," said DeSantis, who defended the rights of parents to choose charter schools. We looked back at Gillum’s statements about charter schools to see if he had called for any change to the status quo, and found he has been consistently critical of the involvement of for-profit entities in charter schools. (He has also called for a $1 billion increase in corporate taxes for education.) DeSantis wants to continue many Republican school initiatives, including supporting charter schools. Gillum’s criticism of charter schools Gillum has been a critic of for-profit involvement in charter schools throughout his campaign. Charter schools are public schools but operated by an entity other than a school district. They must be operated or controlled by a nonprofit organization by law, but some nonprofit charter school boards enter into contracts with for-profit companies. (It is hard to say exactly how many, due to murky state data however charter schools affiliated with for-profit firms are a large and growing sector of Florida’s charter schools.) A Miami Herald investigation in 2011 found charter schools are "controlled largely by for-profit management companies and private landlords — one and the same, in many cases — and rife with insider deals and potential conflicts of interest." That distinction is at the heart of Gillum’s critique. He couches his opposition to say he is a critic of for-profit charter schools. When asked on WPTV in February if he supports the charter school concept, Gillum said "my issue is not with charters. My issue is with for-profit charter schools who take money away from the public system badly needed in the public system." Gillum made some of his most forceful comments against for-profit involvement in charter schools in a June primary debate. "What we’ve got to do is end this for-profit regime that the Republicans have entered into the public education system here in the state of Florida," Gillum said. "We’ve got to do it immediately. ... I would be completely against for-profit charters in this state." During an August primary debate, Gillum said the governor and Legislature "have moved more and more of our public dollars out of public schools and into for-profit charter schools. We need to end that." After Gillum won the primary, he continued to criticize for-profit charter schools. In September, the AP paraphrased Gillum as stating that it was time to stop siphoning off public money into privately run schools. Gillum said he would seek to bring the state's current voucher programs to a "conclusion." While Gillum hasn’t provided a detailed road map to the steps he would take if elected to crack down on for profits, he has made it clear these schools are in his crosshairs, and he views the involvement of for-profit entities as a problem. We asked his campaign to clarify whether he would try to shutter existing charter schools managed by for-profit entities, something that would require buy-in from the state Legislature. Campaign spokeswoman Carlie Waibel said Gillum "will not shut down charter schools," saying he wants to bring them more "transparency and standards." Lynn Norman-Teck, executive director of the Florida Charter School Alliance, disagrees with a blanket condemnation of charter schools that are managed by for profit entities. For some schools, the for profit entity does back office type of work while in others they have a larger role. "We should be looking at the value of a school whether it is a district school or private school or charter," she said. "Let’s look at the return on investment -- are they reaping results? Are those children moving forward?" Our ruling DeSantis says Gillum was "singing a different tune" about charter schools at the Florida debate. That was a reference to Gillum’s answer to a question about whether he would cut any dollars from charter schools. But Gillum was downplaying his previous comments on charters, saying he would not propose any change to the "current status quo." He went on to say he was "going to put money into our public system where over 90 percent of our kids are still being educated." During the primary, Gillum had tougher words. He said Florida should "end this for-profit regime" immediately, in regard to charter schools managed by for-profit entities, and he called for an "end" of moving more public dollars to for-profit charters. What DeSantis omits is that Gillum hasn’t called for an end to all charter schools — he is targeting those that are managed by for-profit entities. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-00988	DeKalb County has graduated five police academies and three fire academies to help reach its ambitious hiring goals in both departments.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/feb/09/lee-may/interim-ceo-mostly-right-dekalb-police-firefighter/	Public safety is one of the top issues voters cite when creating new cities. So it’s no surprise that interim CEO Lee May would highlight growth in the police and fire departments in DeKalb County – where four new towns are being discussed on the neighborhood and legislative levels. "Since taking on this position, we have graduated five police academies and three fire academies," May said during his recent State of the County address. "This is proving to make our neighborhoods safer places for our children and families to grow." The claim would put DeKalb on pace to reach an ambitious goal May laid out in Fall 2013: Hire 160 police officers and 100 firefighters every year for three years to halt a hemorrhage of public safety workers that hurt the morale of workers and taxpayers. But with the press for new cities in the county, and more calls for existing cities to annex neighborhoods, did DeKalb actually hit its annual goal? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. Gov. Nathan Deal tapped May to serve as CEO in July 2013, replacing CEO Burrell Ellis, who is suspended while he faces corruption charges. That put May in charge of preparing the 2014 budget, to be amended and approved by the County Commission. May took over just as DeKalb, like many local jurisdictions, was seeing a small rebound from the collapse in the housing market. The county, also like others, had suffered through the revenue losses in part by cutting jobs or keeping positions unfilled, including those in public safety. In September 2013, DeKalb had 915 police officers to fill 1,100 slots. There were 600 firefighters for 789 positions. Worse, the county also lost more officers and firefighters than it could hire through its training academies, which can take up to 26 weeks to complete. In four years, DeKalb hired 277 police officers while 400 left. The fire department’s attrition was even worse: hiring 71 firefighters in four years, while 236 departed. The end of the economic downturn helped boost last year’s budget by $25 million, to $584 million for the general fund. The county set aside $6.6 million and $2.9 of the extra money to hire additional officers and firefighters, budget records show. And both departments held recruit academies for applicants who already passed basic job requirements. For police, the training lasts three weeks for state-certified officers from elsewhere in Georgia, seven weeks for certified officers from other states, and 26 weeks for all candidates with no previous police experience. The dates and number of hires were: 97th Police Academy, graduated Feb. 14, 2014 – 29. 98th Police Academy, graduated May 30, 2014 – 32. 99th Police Academy, graduated July 31, 2014 – 33. 100th Police Academy, graduated Sept. 26, 2014 – 22. 101st Police Academy, graduated Jan. 16, 2015 – 35. Total hired: 151. That puts the police department at 94 percent of its annual goal. But the overall numbers actually fell. As of Feb. 1, DeKalb had 859 sworn officers, out of 1,060 authorized sworn positions – tumbling from 83 percent filled to 81 percent filled since May took over. Interim Police Chief James Conroy said that the challenge was ramping up the training after going nearly all of 2013 without any academies – all while losing officers. Momentum is on the county’s side, Conroy added. The current academy, the 102nd, has 26 recruits enrolled for a May graduation. Recruitment and retention efforts in the fire/rescue department were better. The department held two general firefighter academies, graduating in February and September. Training includes the courses required for basic firefighters, which takes 18-20 weeks, and also includes advanced EMT training. For recruits with no previous experience, the academy can take up to 10 ½ months. That means the graduates in 2014 may have started with DeKalb in 2013, hired as recruits. But the county also hired 85 additional recruits in September, and 15 more in October, to hit its annual goal of 100 new firefighters, according to Fire Chief Darnell Fullum. The first group from that academy will graduate in April and be placed in stations. "I know we have met our initiative," Fullum said. And, as of Feb. 1, the department had 659 sworn firefighters for 671 spots. That meant the department was 98 percent filled, compared to 76 percent when May started.. May said he considers the aggressive hiring effort a success in both departments, noting that 2014 was just the first year of a three-year effort that will be measured as one initiative. County leaders knew not every recruit who entered the academy would graduate and serve, he added, noting DeKalb is getting better at identifying candidates who will be successful. "We still have space, in terms of authorized positions, to get us to our goals," May said. "We are communicating as best we can, to everyone from the public to our employees, that public safety is our top priority and we intend to see results." That means DeKalb is taking strides towards its overall goal, of hiring 480 police officers and 300 firefighters by the end of 2016. So where does that leave us? May said that the county had held five police academies and three fire/rescue academies in 2014. He is right on the number of academies, but off on what that means. Being spot on with the amount of training underway for DeKalb’s hiring binge in public safety doesn’t translate into the goals of that training being fully met. We rate May’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-05136	In 2008, "33.2 percent of those who voted early on the last Sunday before Election Day were African-American, while 23.6 percent were Hispanic."	true	/florida/statements/2012/jun/22/corrine-brown/souls-polls-sunday-drew-more-african-american-and-/	When Floridians head to church on the Sunday before Election Day in November, they might hear sermons about voting. But unlike 2008, they won’t be able to head straight to the polls afterward. In 2011, the state Legislature passed an election bill signed by Gov. Rick Scott that, among other changes, eliminated early voting on the last Sunday before Election Day. Critics argued that the moves were partisan and that the Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican governor wanted to block Democrats and churches from geting out the vote. Dubbed "Souls to the Polls," Democratic-friendly groups sometimes bussed voters to election sites on that final Sunday. And getting rid of that final Sunday affects minorities, said U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville. "Statistics show that in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33.2 percent of those who voted early on the last Sunday before Election Day were African-American, while 23.6 percent were Hispanic," Brown wrote in a June 15 press release. Brown’s precise percentages caught our attention, so we decided to check out her numbers. Florida's voting rules First, a little background: Early voting started in Florida in 2004. It expanded traditional Election Day voting to include early voting sites. Starting in 2002, Floridians could also request a "no excuse" absentee ballot, so anyone could vote by mail for any reason. In 2011, the Florida Legislature passed a new law (HB 1355) that made a variety of changes to rules for early voting. The legislation cut the number of days of early voting from 14 to eight, and it eliminated voting the final Sunday before Election Day. In 2012, that means that Floridians can early vote Sunday, Oct. 28, but not Nov. 4 -- two days before Election Day. We should point out that early voting on the final Sunday was never required. Instead, it was an option for counties, and only about 10 of 67 took advantage of it in 2008, including some counties with higher minority populations. Smaller counties generally chose not to have early voting on Sundays, because officials figured people were attending church or spending time with their families rather than going to vote, said Vicki Davis, Supervisor of Elections in Martin County and now president of the statewide association of election supervisors. When legislators decided to get rid of early voting on the final Sunday, some county officials were disappointed, while others wanted that last Sunday to prepare for Election Day, she said. The state is required to get federal approval for any changes in voting law for five counties that have had historical voting problems, including Hillsborough County. The state has sought approval from a federal three-judge panel in Washington and several voting rights’ groups have filed objections with the court. The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law has argued on the side that claims that the law will disproportionally harm minority voters. None of the five pre-clearance counties offered early voting on that final Sunday in 2008. Researchers examined the race of voters on the final Sunday Brown’s spokesman said that the statistics about minority voting on the final Sunday came from the NAACP, and we found several researchers have cited similar statistics to Brown’s claim. They arrive at those numbers by obtaining statewide early vote data and then matching voters’ information with registration records which list self-reported race and ethnicity. Here is what professors and lawyers found for who voted early on Sunday Nov. 2, 2008 The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law: • African-American: 33.2 percent • Hispanic: 23.6 percent The Brennan Center was focused on the impact of minorities and didn’t list a percentage for whites. University of Florida political science professor Daniel A Smith and Michael Herron, professor of government at Dartmouth: • Whites: 40 percent • African American: 34 percent • Hispanics: 24 percent • Asian: 2 percent "We find that Democratic, African-American, Hispanic, younger, and first-time voters were disproportionately likely to vote early in 2008 and in particular on weekends, including the final Sunday of early voting," wrote the professors in a paper. Justin Levitt of Loyola Law School: • White: 37.2 percent • African-American: 31.5 percent • Hispanic: 22.4 percent • Unknown: 5.1 percent • Other: 3.8 percent Levitt told us in an email that those percentages represent conservative estimates: Voters of unknown race or ethnicity were treated for purposes of this analysis as white. The three sets of research reached similar conclusions for the turnout on the final Sunday of early voting: About one-third were black and about one-quarter were Hispanic. That’s higher than their representation in the overall electorate that year: Blacks comprised 13 percent of total voters and Hispanics 11 percent, Levitt wrote. Other perspective on the Sunday law Chris Cate, a spokesman for the state Division of Elections, said in an email that, "Advocates of Sunday voting should actually favor the new law because it requires a day of Sunday voting, which the previous law did not." The required Sunday voting is about a week and a half before Election Day -- not the final Sunday. Cate said he didn’t have data on voting by race for only the final Sunday of early voting in 2008. However he pointed to statistics cited in the pre-clearance case that looked at voter turnout by race or ethnicity for the days that have since been repealed -- including that final Sunday -- compared to the remaining days. The data showed that whites comprised the largest group of early voters and that more whites, African-Americans and Hispanics voted on the remaining days than the repealed ones leading the state to argue that "shortening the early voting period will have no discriminatory effect on account of race or ethnicity." It's no surprise that more whites used early voting than minorities, though, because whites make up the largest share of the state’s voters. Our ruling Brown said that "Statistics show that in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33.2 percent of those who voted early on the last Sunday before Election Day were African-American, while 23.6 percent were Hispanic." She used that statistic to predict that changes to voting law will disproportionately impact minorities. The law’s proponents predict that it won’t, and that minorities will avail themselves of other days and times for early voting. We can’t settle that argument. But we did check the numbers Brown cited. Those numbers are backed up by sound research from multiple sources. We rate her claim True.

pomt-02691	Says David Jolly lobbied "for government-run health care just last year."	false	/florida/statements/2014/jan/06/kathleen-peters/kathleen-peters-says-david-jolly-was-lobbying-gove/	Republican hopefuls for the open 13th Congressional District seat have been spending time arguing about who opposes Obamacare the most. Kathleen Peters called a press conference on Dec. 19 to accuse rival David Jolly of promoting the health insurance law during his days as a lobbyist, even though he has said he opposes it. "David Jolly claims that he opposes Obamacare, but that didn't stop him from lobbying for government-run health care just last year, when he made over $80,000 from special interests," Peters said. "In 2012, David Jolly lobbied only one client in Florida, Faneuil Inc., which is a company that runs call centers for Obamacare. Even for a Washington insider, it takes a special kind of dishonesty to publicly oppose Obamacare while personally profiting from it." Given Jolly’s stance to repeal the Affordable Care Act, it would indeed be awkward if he made $80,000 lobbying for the law. We decided to check the paperwork on this one. Peters makes a call on call center Jolly worked as an aide and general counsel for the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young for more than a decade before becoming a lobbyist in 2007 for Washington firm Van Scoyoc Associates. He then lobbied through his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors, from 2011 until earlier this year, when he de-registered as a lobbyist to run for Young’s vacant House seat. Lobbyists are required by law to disclose their clients, and Jolly listed work as a consultant for Faneuil in statements filed Dec. 2. The form requires candidates to list all positions both paid and unpaid in the current calendar year and the two years prior. Faneuil is a Virginia company that specializes in "business processing solutions," such as running call centers, managing data entry or billing and providing customer service by phone or email. Peters couldn’t provide specifics to link Jolly to lobbying in connection with the health care law, while Jolly’s team said he worked for the company to advocate for "transportation interests in Florida." Faneuil provides toll collectors and other employees under a staffing contract with the Florida Department of Transportation. Faneuil general counsel Alden J. Eldredge also said Jolly didn’t work on matters dealing with the health care law. Faneuil employed Jolly’s Three Bridges Advisors firm in the Sunshine State from May to December 2012. In March 2013, Faneuil announced it had been selected to operate a Spokane, Wash., call center for the state’s health insurance exchange, Washington Healthplanfinder. The center began taking calls for enrollment assistance on Oct. 1. Neither Jolly nor Faneuil would further specify Jolly’s role with the company, although Jolly’s campaign emphasized that the Washington call center contract wasn’t awarded to Faneuil until March 2013, when Jolly was no longer being paid. Peters didn’t connect her own dots in the ensuing days. The following week, a flier appeared throughout Pinellas County mailboxes with slightly different wording: "Last year, Washington lobbyist Jolly was paid at least $80,000 to represent a D.C.-area company that signs up people for Obamacare," it reads. "Yet, as a candidate, he continues to claim he’s opposed to Obamacare … and makes false attacks against Kathleen Peters for her position." That last part is aimed at Jolly’s previous assertion that Peters was not clearly in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act. PolitiFact Florida checked a previous mailer from Jolly’s campaign that alleged Peters "refuses to ‘take a stand’ to repeal Obamacare." We found that claim Mostly False. Otherwise, the mailer avoids saying specifically that Jolly had been "lobbying for government-run health care," as she said in the press conference. Our ruling Peters said at a press conference that Jolly was guilty of "lobbying for government-run health care just last year." She was attempting to link her opponent with Faneuil, a company that has worked with Washington state to operate a health care exchange. Both Jolly and Faneuil say Jolly wasn’t lobbying on health care, and we didn’t find specific evidence to show that he worked on that project. Peters later backed off the accusation, changing the wording in a mailer to point out Jolly was being paid by a company that also is paid for operating an Obamacare health exchange. Peters didn’t find any specific evidence linking Jolly to the Washington call center project, and we didn’t find anything more in our own review of the public records. Meanwhile, the Jolly campaign offers a plausible explanation for what kind of work he did for the company. Due to a lack of evidence, we rate Peters’ statement False.

pomt-05995	Says Barack Obama "began his presidency going on a worldwide apology tour."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/jan/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-obama-made-worldwide-apology-tour/	U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz all but channeled Mitt Romney during the Jan. 12, 2012, Republican Senate debate hosted in Austin by the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Empower Texans. Saying the federal government’s first obligation is to provide for national security, Cruz referred to President Barack Obama, saying: "This is a president who began his presidency going on a worldwide apology tour." Is that right? Cruz’s claim reminded us of a comment by Romney in the Sept. 22, 2011, GOP presidential debate when he said Obama "went around the world and apologized for America." Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, had earlier made this charge several times including in his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness. In the book, Romney gave seven examples: "In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy." PolitiFact in Washington rated that Romney claim False, later rating Pants on Fire Romney’s statement in June 2011 implying that delivering apologies was the purpose for Obama’s visits. In checking Cruz’s reference to Obama’s travels as a "worldwide apology tour," let’s start by revisiting what Obama said after taking office -- and if he apologized. We’ll share what our PolitiFact colleagues learned from experts on foreign policy and apologies, and also compare statements from Obama predecessors President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton. First, what constitutes an apology? "A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it," scholar Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann told PolitiFact in 2010. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the website Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. An illustration: "To say the United States will not torture is not an apology; it is a statement of intent," Howard-Hassman said. Merriam-Webster defines an apology as "an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret." And one word is the universal hallmark of apologies: "Sorry." Bush and Clinton each used "sorry" in speaking of certain past American actions. Clinton gave a forceful apology to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala., in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. "The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong," Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. "To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can ... finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry." In contrast, a 1998 Clinton statement that was described as an apology listed missteps, but did not include his saying "sorry." "The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well," he said in remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. "We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope." Bush privately apologized to King Abdullah of Jordan in 2004 for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Soon after, at a Rose Garden press conference, Bush said, "I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America. I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America." Some people construed as an apology remarks Bush made in 2002 about American slavery at Goree Island, Senegal. But Bush did not explicitly apologize or express regret: "My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy, and it is not over," he said. "The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all." Back to Obama: PolitiFact isolated the passages Romney cited that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory. The passages are compiled in a separate document with links to the full remarks, but we’ll give brief recaps here. At a town hall meeting in France, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and said the United States "has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a "casual" and "insidious" anti-Americanism. In a major address to the United Nations, Obama said: "I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction." In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama turned the question toward Bush. "Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable," Obama said. "I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world." At a speech in Cairo on relations between the United States and the Islamic world, Obama said, "In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward." Also, Romney’s book cites four instances of Obama discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Typically, Obama would say that the U.S. must stay true to its ideals, and that's why he "unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year." (Obama has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; consider it a Promise Broken.) At the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism, Obama said that after 9/11, "our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions." So, did Obama apologize? In 2010, PolitiFact ran the excerpts past experts with different points of view. Nile Gardiner of the conservative Heritage Foundation said Obama was definitely apologizing, and it's not good. He co-wrote the June 2009 Heritage analysis "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." When we inquired about Cruz’s debate comment, Cruz’s spokesman, James Bernsen, offered the Gardiner article as backup along with an April 2009 opinion column by Karl Rove in which the former senior adviser to Bush reflected on Obama’s "international confession tour." Gardiner told PolitiFact: "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies. It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." Gardiner suggested that Obama tends to be most apologetic about how the United States has fought terrorism and its approach to the Iraq war. "There is a very strong partisan element to his apologies, but the biggest driving factor is Obama's personal belief that the U.S. is not an exceptional, uniquely great nation," he said. John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret." Romney's criticisms of Obama are part of a conservative tradition that emphasizes steadfastness in foreign policy, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War. "There's long been a strain of conservative rhetoric that argues that what matters most for the United States in the world is our will," Murphy said. "The difficulty with that was shown in the second Bush administration, when will power is not quite enough. In Iraq, for example, you have to have a battle plan that makes sense and understand the situation you're going into'' and have enough resources to do that. Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fall short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Obama's remarks are really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy. "Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal," Bloom said. "For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable." Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying, 'I respect your society, and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." Our ruling Obama made no secret during the campaign that he intended to set a different course on foreign policy than Bush -- a committed unilateralist -- had pursued. Yet it’s incorrect to portray these early speeches as part of a global apology tour. Using this standard, you could argue that any change in foreign policy that’s undertaken after a presidential transition and announced to the world would constitute an "apology" for the previous policy. Obama's speeches contained criticisms of past U.S. actions, but not one full-throated apology. Cruz’s debate claim is so far off the mark, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-10436	"It is just a fact that Hamas, apparently the North American spokesperson, is endorsing Senator Obama."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/09/john-mccain/praise-but-not-a-formal-endorsement/	UPDATE: Since we published this item, Hamas has changed its tune on Obama. After his speech to the American Israel Political Action Committee on June 4, 2008, Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that his group no longer had any preference in the U.S. election. "Hamas does not differentiate between the two presidential candidates, Obama and McCain, because their policies regarding the Arab-Israel conflict are the same and are hostile to us, therefore we do have no preference and are not wishing for either of them to win," Zuhri said. We will keep the item in our database for archival purposes because it was accurate when McCain said it, but readers should note that the "endorsement" has since been withdrawn. ************** Sen. Barack Obama has been racking up the endorsements lately, but he's gotten some kind words from a group he won't be touting on any news release: Hamas, the militant Islamic organization. Sen. John McCain has characterized it as an endorsement, which we find to be a bit of a stretch. But still, it's strong praise. McCain made the claim several times — in a fundraising e-mail, a news conference, even during an appearance on the Daily Show. "It is just a fact that Hamas, apparently the North American spokesperson, is endorsing Senator Obama. People can make their own judgment from that," McCain told reporters April 25, 2008, referring to comments made by Ahmed Yousef, chief political adviser to the prime minister of Hamas. McCain's campaign told us that he based his comment on this quotation from Yousef in an interview with WABC Radio on April 20, 2008: "We don't mind — actually we like Mr. Obama. We hope that he will (inaudible word) the election and I do believe he is like John Kennedy, great man with a great principle, and he has a vision to change America to make it in a position to lead the world community, but not with domination and arrogance." [The word in parentheses above is not audible in the recording, but Yousef's comments before and after the word suggest he was saying "we hope he will win the election."] Before we examine McCain's claim, it's important to know a little about Hamas and its relationship with the United States, which officially considers it a terrorist group. The Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan foreign policy think tank, describes Hamas as "the largest and most influential Palestinian militant movement." Its goals include the destruction of Israel, the replacement of the Palestinian Authority with an Islamic state on the West Bank and Gaza, and to raise "the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine." Hamas won the Palestinian elections in 2006 and now controls the Gaza Strip, home to more than 1-million Palestinians. The victory created a touchy diplomatic situation for the Bush administration, which has trumpeted democracy in the Middle East but has opposed Hamas because of its terrorist tactics and its goal of destroying Israel. Hamas' praise for Obama is notable because the Illinois senator has repeatedly denounced the group. He has called it a terrorist organization and said it was a "bad idea" for former President Jimmy Carter to meet with Khaled Meshaal, the group's exiled leader. Obama told a Jewish group on April 16, 2008, "We must not negotiate with a terrorist group intent on Israel's destruction. We should only sit down with Hamas if they renounce terrorism, recognize Israel's right to exist, and abide by past agreements." But is McCain right that Hamas has endorsed Obama? First, we should note that McCain got Yousef's title wrong. He is chief political adviser to the prime minister of Hamas, not a North American spokesman. Still, Yousef is a senior adviser in the organization and his views probably represent the organization's position, according to David Schenker, director of the Arab Politics Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a foreign policy think tank. "I think the quote demonstrates a sentiment that represents what Hamas is thinking about the U.S. presidential race," Schenker said. "It's not an endorsement in the traditional sense that we think of it, but I think it's an expression of what they think will be best for their organization." Schenker said that even though Obama has criticized Carter and opposes diplomatic talks with Hamas, the group probably prefers Obama over McCain because of Obama's willingness to have diplomatic talks with Iran and Syria, which are allies of Hamas. Steven Cook, a fellow for Middle East politics at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he doesn't consider it an official endorsement, but Hamas believes "Obama would be a better president of the United States." Cook said Obama "is wildly popular in the Arab world" because of expectations that he would be different from President Bush. That's based more on hopes than actual statements, though. The senator isn't well-known in the Arab world, so Arabs are "projecting their views onto Obama," Cook said. Cook said the Hamas support is odd because "there is no way you can interpret anything (Obama) said as against Israel. I think (people in the Arab world) are going to be deeply disappointed if he comes to power as president. I think there will be change in American foreign policy in the Middle East, but I think the steadfast support for Israel will remain." The Obama campaign is not particularly pleased with kind words from a terrorist group. In a CNN interview on May 8, 2008, Obama responded to a question about McCain's comment by saying it was offensive and that McCain is "losing his bearings." But Obama did not deny that the Hamas official had been supportive of his campaign. Obama may not like the kind words from a U.S. enemy, but still, they are kind words. They may not constitute an official endorsement, but they are pretty close. We find McCain's statement to be Mostly True.

Trump has long bemoaned the United States’ trade deficit with China, and as a candidate he promised to use import taxes to reorder trade arrangements along what he believes are more reciprocal lines. "Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China," Trump said at a March 23 news conference. "We can't let that happen." A country’s trade balance is simply the difference between the value of its imports and exports, and a trade deficit occurs when imports exceed exports. This can be measured in terms of goods, or both goods and services. We took a closer look at Trump’s numbers. It turns out he’s well off the mark. U.S.-China trade in goods The United States’ deficit with China in goods trade has grown substantially over roughly the past two decades. The deficit in 1990 was $10.4 billion. It grew to $83.8 billion in 2000 and swelled to $273 billion in 2010, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. In 2017, the value of Chinese goods imported to the United States ($505 billion) exceeded American goods exports to China ($130 billion) by roughly $375 billion. Americans racked up billions in purchases of everything from Chinese-made communications and computer equipment, to kitchen appliances and shoes. Based on trade in goods, Trump's $500 billion figure is off by $125 billion. U.S.-China trade in services When you factor in goods and services, which economists say paints the fuller picture, his claim is further off the mark. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the United States actually ran a surplus in the services trade with China in 2017 — to the tune of roughly $38.5 billion. When you factor that surplus into the two countries’ overall trade balance, the United States ran a roughly $336 billion deficit with China last year — which means Trump’s figure was off by about $164 billion. It’s possible Trump may have confused the Chinese deficit with the United States’ overall trade deficit, which was $566 billion in 2017, according to the bureau. However, it’s also possible Trump used the $500 billion figure as a matter of habit. We rated this claim Mostly False when he said it in 2015. Our ruling Trump said, "Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China." In 2017, the value of Chinese goods imported to the United States exceeded American goods exports to China by roughly $375 billion. Over that same period, the United States actually ran a $38.5 billion surplus on services trade with China. Overall, in terms of both goods and services, the United States trade deficit with China in 2017 was around $336 billion — meaning Trump was off by roughly $164 billion. We rate this Mostly False.

pomt-12396	"(James) Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source & covered it up for Hillary (Clinton)."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/26/patriotcriercom/conspiracy-theory-comey-hid-seth-richs-ties-wikile/	A conspiracy theory that said former FBI director James Comey was covering up the source of leaked Democratic National Committee emails for Hillary Clinton is based on a single source that has admitted he had no evidence. The headline on a May 16, 2017, post on PatriotCrier.com read, "Bombshell: Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source & covered it up for Hillary." Facebook users flagged the story in an effort to identify potential fake news. The post is based on a persistent and unfounded conspiracy theory about how the website WikiLeaks came by thousands of internal DNC emails during last year’s presidential election. Seth Rich's death Seth Rich was a 27-year-old voter access projects staffer for the DNC who was shot and killed near his Washington home on July 10, 2016. The case is still unsolved, but Washington police said it was probably a botched robbery. WikiLeaks published thousands of emails a few days after Rich’s death. Some conspiracy theorists have concluded that Rich must have been the one who leaked the emails, and was killed to scare other potential leakers. WikiLeaks offered $20,000 for more information about Rich’s death, drawing some attention to the scenario. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has never said Rich was the source. On May 15, Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by Rich’s family, claimed he could prove Rich was indeed the source of the leak. He told Washington-area Fox affiliate WTTG that sources in the FBI said they had evidence proving it. The next day, Fox News reported an anonymous federal investigator backed up what Wheeler was saying. This official said the FBI had determined Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks, sending them more than 40,000 DNC emails. Most of the PatriotCrier.com conspiracy theory is based on this unfounded insistence that the FBI has proof of this connection. "It’s apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement, but the fact is the FBI has been in possession of Rich’s laptop and the agency’s director at the time, James Comey, locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillary’s campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three," the PatriotCrier.com post read. There is no contact information on PatriotCrier.com, and we did not receive a response when we contacted the site through an affiliated Facebook page. The site’s registration information is hidden. It’s quite a stretch to pin on an anonymous federal investigator that Comey examined the evidence, drew a conclusion that proved Rich was the WikiLeaks source and then hid it specifically to protect Clinton. Wheeler didn’t even mention the former FBI director, and we didn’t find any evidence of Comey commenting on Rich’s death. The entire conspiracy theory had been under the radar, confined to corners of the Internet, until Wheeler’s story emerged, by which time Comey had been fired by President Donald Trump. But the more egregious problem with the PatriotCrier.com post is that it didn’t include what happened next: Wheeler admitted to CNN on March 16 that he had actually gotten the information from the Fox News reporter to whom he had discussed the issue. The Rich family sent Wheeler a cease-and-desist letter, saying their son was not WikiLeaks’ source. They also demanded retractions from Fox for reporting the story. Fox News eventually retracted its story and removed it from FoxNews.com. WTTG posted a follow-up to its story, saying Wheeler had backtracked on what he described as a "miscommunication." The FBI has not officially acknowledged conducting an investigation (a WhiteHouse.gov petition demanding Comey get involved was created in January 2017, but has so far only garnered about 1,000 signatures). Some media outlets have reported that anonymous FBI and law enforcement officials confirmed the agency is not investigating Rich’s death, and that Washington police never gave them Rich’s laptop and therefore the agency hadn’t examined its contents. An FBI spokeswoman confirmed only that Rich's death was being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department. What the FBI did do is alert the DNC of a data breach prior to the WikiLeaks release, and subsequently connected the breach to hackers with Russian ties. The only other source even remotely supporting the idea Rich was involved is a hacker living in New Zealand named Kim Dotcom. He said someone going by the name of Panda had contacted him in 2014 to get help starting a political group in the United States. Dotcom said he is certain Panda was actually Rich, and knows that Rich was the WikiLeaks source. He has not shown any proof. Dotcom is currently facing extradition to the United States on a host of conspiracy and racketeering charges levied by the Justice Department. Rich’s family also has denied the link Dotcom is making between Rich and WikiLeaks, and has said Dotcom actually tried to plant bogus evidence implicating Rich. And in any event, the PatriotCrier.com post didn’t make any mention of Dotcom or his claims. The Metropolitan Police Department, meanwhile, is still investigating Rich’s death as a homicide. Our ruling PatriotCrier.com said, "Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source and covered it up for Hillary." The website’s assertion that Comey knew Rich was WikiLeaks’ source of the DNC emails and hid the evidence to protect Clinton is a wild assumption based on refuted evidence. A private investigator had claimed that the FBI had analyzed Rich’s laptop and found proof that he had given the emails to WikiLeaks, but then recanted his story. Fox News and its network affiliate, which had broadcast the story, later retracted it. There’s no evidence there’s any link between Rich and WikiLeaks. The FBI has indirectly denied investigating the case, which Washington police consider a robbery gone wrong. With no concrete proof of this far-fetched claim, we rate it Pants On Fire! Editor's note: Shortly after this fact-check was published, an FBI spokeswoman officially confirmed that Rich's death was being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department.

pomt-02231	Every one of "more than 30 federal judges who have considered the issue of gay and lesbian rights since last June… ruled that marriage is a constitutional right and you cannot deprive individual citizens of that right based on their sexual orientation."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/apr/16/david-boies/attorney-overstates-number-federal-judges-who-have/	For nearly a year, many federal judges have uniformly held that marriage is a fundamental right for all, a pair of lawyers said April 8, 2014, during the Civil Rights Summit at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library. Attorney David Boies, speaking after Ted Olson aired a similar point, put it this way: "Here you have more than 30 federal judges who have considered the issue of gay and lesbian rights since last June. And every one of them--appointed by Republicans, appointed by Democrats, appointed by all of the last four or five presidents--in every area of the country, in Texas to Utah to Ohio to Oklahoma to Michigan, north south east west, every political affiliation, they’ve all ruled the same way. Every one of them has ruled that marriage is a constitutional right and you cannot deprive individual citizens of that right based on their sexual orientation." We suspect Boies singled out judicial rulings since June 2013 because the U.S. Supreme Court that month overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which had been enacted in 1996 to limit marriage, under federal law, to the union of one man and one woman. Writing for the 5-4 majority in U.S. v. Windsor, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said the law, known as DOMA, violated the core constitutional principle that people are entitled to equal protection under the law. Kennedy said DOMA’s main purpose was to demean and stigmatize homosexuals, relegating them to second-class status and humiliating the children they are raising. Kennedy concluded there can be no legitimate government purpose for a law intended to "disparage and to injure." Did more than 30 federal judges subsequently hold marriage to be a right for all? After asking Boies’ office for his backup information, we turned to Lambda Legal, a gay rights group, for its analysis. Spokesman Tom Warnke emailed us its compendium of pending "marriage equality" cases. As of March 6, 2014, according to the breakdown, the marriage restrictions of 28 states were at issue in 55 pending lawsuits--37 in federal court and 18 in state court. Only seven states that don’t currently provide for "marriage equality" were lacking legal challenges, according to the document: Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. By our read, the breakdown showed several federal judges siding with gay-marriage proponents, though we didn’t see the count getting as high as 30--or even 20. Using the breakdown and news stories we found using the Nexis search tool, we identified favorable rulings by district judges issued from December 2013 through February 2014 in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Illinois, Texas, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio: On Dec. 20, 2013, U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby of Utah said the state’s ban on gay marriage "conflicts with the United States Constitution’s guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law. The state’s current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason," the New York Times reported in a news story posted online that day. On Jan. 14, 2014, U.S. Senior Judge Terence Kern struck down Oklahoma’s ban on same-sex marriage, saying it "intentionally discriminates against same-sex couples desiring an Oklahoma marriage license without a legally sufficient justification," according to a news story posted online that day by the Daily Oklahoman. On Feb. 13, 2014, U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen of Virginia held the state’s "marriage laws unconstitutionally deny Virginia's gay and lesbian citizens the fundamental freedom to choose to marry," according to a USA Today news story posted the next morning. On Feb. 21, 2014, U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman issued a decision enabling Cook County couples to marry regardless of sexual orientation. In her decision, according to a Chicago Tribune news story posted online that day, Coleman said "there is no reason to delay further when no opposition has been presented to this court and committed gay and lesbian couples have already suffered from the denial of their fundamental right to marry." On Feb. 26, 2014, U.S District Judge Orlando Garcia of San Antonio, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, ruled unconstitutional the Texas ban on gay marriage and issued an injunction barring Texas from enforcing its prohibitions on same-sex couples marrying, the Austin American-Statesman said in a news story posted that evening. "Without a rational relation to a legitimate government purpose, state-imposed inequality can find no refuge in our United States Constitution," Garcia held, though he stayed the ruling, enabling the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to weigh in before Texans attempted to wed. On Feb. 27, 2014, U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II of Kentucky threw out part of Kentucky’s marriage restrictions, formalizing his Feb. 12 ruling that Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriages treated "gay and lesbian persons differently in a way that demeans them," Fox News reported. "Same-sex couples may change their names on official identifications and documents and obtain any other benefits of a married couple in Kentucky," the story said, though the "order doesn't affect a related lawsuit seeking to force the state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples." On March 21, 2014, U.S. Senior Judge Bernard Friedman of Michigan overturned the state’s voter-approved bar on gay marriages, saying in his ruling that the limit violated the equal protection clause of the constitution. The Statesman story on the Texas ruling said a judge had forced Ohio to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages on death certificates. And after that story ran, U.S. District Judge Timothy Black of Ohio said April 4, 2014, that he intended to order Ohio to recognize out-of-state gay marriages, a move that strikes down part of the state's ban on gay marriages, the Associated Press reported that day. Lynn Wardle, a Brigham Young University law professor who has advocated that the Constitution leaves it to legislators to stipulate who may marry, emailed us his March 2014 paper on the legal status of marriage around the world, which brought to our attention two more rulings, one of them not to any advocate’s advantage. In a Tennessee case--which gets us to nine federal judges supportive of the legality of same-sex marriage since late 2013--U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger on March 14, 2014, granted a preliminary injunction against the state’s same-sex marriage ban in certain instances, the Tennessean newspaper reported that day. "At this point, all signs indicate that, in the eyes of the United States Constitution, the plaintiffs’ marriages will be placed on an equal footing with those of heterosexual couples and that proscriptions against same-sex marriage will soon become a footnote in the annals of American history," Trauger wrote. By phone, Wardle suggested there has been at least a speed bump among the rulings in that a federal judge in Wisconsin declined to grant plaintiffs a preliminary injunction against the state’s bar on gay marriage, though he said that doesn’t signal she’ll ultimately rule against the plaintiffs. According to an undated web post by Lesbian/Gay Law Notes, published by the the LGBT Bar Association of Greater New York, the Wisconsin judge, Barbara B. Crabb, told plaintiffs that if they withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction, she would set an expedited trial schedule; they did and she did. Our search yielded one ruling by a state appeals court arguably in the spirit of Boies’ claim. According to an Associated Press news story, New Mexico’s Supreme Court legalized gay marriage Dec. 19, 2013, by deeming the denial of marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples in violation of the state constitution’s "equal protection" clause. Meantime, Wardle guided us to William C. Duncan, the Utah-based president of the Marriage Law Foundation, which says it provides legal resources to defend and protect marriage between a husband and wife. By email, Duncan said he doesn’t see how Boies’ "more than 30" count of federal judges ruling favorably for gay-marriage proponents since June 2013 factually bears out. Duncan specularted that since then, more than 30 cases have been filed challenging state marriage laws. That’s different than what Boies said, no? "Definitely," Duncan said. We failed to connect with Boies while a spokeswoman for his law firm, Dawn Schneider, suggested by email that his statement referred to much more than marriage equality rulings. We sought elaboration and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Boies said that since June 2013, every one of more than 30 federal judges who have considered gay and lesbian rights "has ruled that marriage is a constitutional right and you cannot deprive individual citizens of that right based on their sexual orientation." District judges have almost uniformly ruled for gay-marriage plaintiffs in this timeframe, but Boies’ count of such judges is considerably off. We identified nine federal district judges who have issued such rulings since last June. We rate this claim, which has an element of truth, as Mostly False.

pomt-06771	There are 500 million Internet users "and 80 million bloggers who are driving discussions in China. … So you’ve got a lot of people voicing frustration and discontent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/19/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-internet-use-china-forum-discon/	Jon Huntsman is fluent in all things China. The former Utah governor has held a lifelong interest in the Far East. He speaks fluent Mandarin, and as the U.S. ambassador to China, he lived in Beijing for the last two years until he resigned to run for the Republican nomination for president. Huntsman drew on his experience at a campaign stop in New Hampshire when he spoke about the promise and the potential challenges caused by the growing number of Internet users in the country. "This is a huge, hugely important transition that China's still in the middle of," Huntsman told workers at Cirtronics Corp. in Milford, N.H during a tour on Aug. 2, 2011. "It's ... happening, this transition, at a time when you've got the rise of 500 million Internet users in China," he said. "I mean, can you get your mind around that? Five hundred million Internet users and 80 million bloggers who are driving discussions in China. ... So you've got a lot of people voicing frustration and discontent." If any presidential candidate knows about how often Chinese people use the Internet, it should be Huntsman. But, we wondered if he was right -- particularly whether there are that many bloggers in a country that is not exactly known for free speech. Asked about the source of the numbers, the Huntsman campaign pointed us to media reports from Reuters and the Epoch Times, which, in turn, led us to a study released last month by the Chinese Internet Network Information Center. The Information Center, a non-profit organization administered by the Chinese government, hasn’t yet released an English translation of the study, the "28th Statistical Survey Report on Internet Development in China." But media reports indicate that the report shows the number of Internet users in China to be fast approaching 500 million. The study reports that 485 million people now use the Internet in China, making it the largest Internet nation in the world, according to InternetWorldStats.com, a website that tracks Web use across the globe. And that number, which is up 27 million from last year, will likely pass the 500 million mark by the end of 2011. But the current figure, 485 million, still leaves more than 65 percent of the country’s 1.3 billion people without Internet access, according to the InternetWorldStats.com. By contrast, only 22 percent of households in the United States don't have access. As far as bloggers go, it looks like Huntsman low-balled his number. While he placed the number of bloggers in China at 80 million, the Network Information Center’s report cites numbers as high as 195 million microbloggers across the country. Microblogs are defined as shorter blog posts, not unlike Twitter updates. The Chinese government has blocked both Twitter and Facebook. But it permits use of Sina Weibo, a social media site in the same vein, among other microblogging sites. Huntsman’s figures about the number of bloggers are based on a previous Information Center study, according to the campaign. The report, released in January, said there were 63 million microbloggers. But that number has more than tripled in the months since, reaching 195 million in last month’s report. The center’s numbers may be slightly exaggerated, as the definition of Internet user is broad, but they are generally regarded as the most accurate figures around, according to David Bandurski, editor of the China Media Project website in Hong Kong. "Of course, China is often accused of padding its numbers, but the CNNIC numbers are quite reliable," Bandurski wrote in an e-mail. What’s less certain is the number of Internet users voicing "frustration and discontent," as Huntsman said. Political and activist bloggers often generate attention in China as they fall victim to government censorship. In March, noted Chinese writer Ran Yunfei drew headlines when he was arrested for calling for government protests on his blog. In total, more than 20 activists, including bloggers, have been detained or have gone missing in recent months, according to Amnesty International. Still, in China, as in the United States, most bloggers focus far more on social topics than politics, according to Heather Inwood, a professor of Chinese media at the Ohio State University. The vast majority of blogs and microblog posts are directed more toward media and games than politics or the government, Inwood said. "It's important not to over-emphasize the interest in politics on the Chinese Internet," she said last week. "By far and away, what most people are doing online is relaxing, seeking entertainment, communicating with friends, playing video games. … Blogs really reflect that." Our ruling: Huntsman said there are 500 million Internet users in China and 80 million bloggers, "so you’ve got a lot of people voicing frustration and discontent." He's right about the 500 million and his estimate on bloggers is low, but his underlying point is valid. But it's worth noting that experts say the vast majority of bloggers are writing about social rather than political topics. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-06181	"Rhode Island already gets more revenue per capita from gambling than any other state in the country."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/14/eugene-mckenna/anti-casino-activist-says-rhode-island-gets-more-r/	Despite a sluggish economy, gambling revenue continues to rise in Rhode Island. In fact, gambling is the state’s third-largest source of revenue, bringing in about $355 million in the 2011 fiscal year, according to a recent Journal story. That’s a lot of money, especially for a state facing a huge budget deficit, but for one local group, Rhode Island’s dependence on gambling is far from a good thing. In the Nov. 25 story, the Rev. Eugene J. McKenna, president of Citizens Concerned About Casino Gambling, said that the social costs of gambling far outweigh the financial benefits for the state. He tried to put the problem in perspective. "Gambling is a losing proposition, no matter how you look at it," said Father McKenna, of South Kingstown. "Rhode Island already gets more revenue per capita from gambling than any other state in the country." His claim intrigued us. Is Rhode Island really the national leader in per-capita gambling revenue? Above Nevada, home of the Las Vegas Strip? And New Jersey, which has Atlantic City? We asked Father McKenna where he got his information. He said it’s a longstanding fact that Rhode Island leads the nation in gambling revenue per capita, but he couldn’t immediately give us proof. After our inquiry, he contacted the Stop Predatory Gambling Foundation, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, which cited two reports, one published in 2006 by the National Conference on State Legislatures and the other in 2008 by the Tax Foundation. But there are problems with each list. The National Conference of State Legislatures ranked Rhode Island second behind West Virginia in gambling revenue per capita. But it was a flawed comparison because Rhode Island reported only gross sales, while the other states reported net sales figures that accounted for expenses. The Tax Foundation report, which put Rhode Island at the top of its list, analyzed only lottery sales per capita, not the revenue per capita that Father McKenna cited. And neither report factored in revenues from other sources of gambling in other states, such as casinos, card rooms and racetracks. That’s an important point. Remember, McKenna did not refer only to lottery revenue in his comments. He spoke of gambling revenue. So we searched for more relevant information. Our search yielded a study that does consider gambling revenues as a whole and also calculates revenues on approximately a per capita basis. The study comes from the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, in Albany, N.Y., which, in recent years, has produced annual reports on state-by-state gambling operations. The institute is a public policy think-tank that has been used as a source on state fiscal issues by The New York Times, Bloomberg, Reuters and other media. The institute’s 2011 report looked promising. (It also appealed to us because its title, "Back in the Black: States’ Gambling Revenues Rose in 2010," calls to mind our favorite AC/DC song.) The report examines the four major types of legalized gambling from which states earn revenues -- lotteries, casinos, racinos and traditional pari-mutuel wagering on horse races, greyhound races and jai alai. For Rhode Island, revenues from the state lottery, its two slot parlors, Twin River and Newport Grand, and other betting totaled about $346 million in the 2010 fiscal year. The study then calculated revenue per resident aged 18 or older, the legal gambling age in Rhode Island and most other states. This is not per capita, but it’s a legitimate measure. The same calculation -- revenues per adult resident -- was done for every state, so the study compared apples to apples. The only way the number could be skewed is if Rhode Island has a markedly different ratio of adults than other states. According to the 2010 census, 76 percent of the national population is aged 18 or over. In Rhode Island, the number is 78.7 percent. That’s pretty close. So using the Rockefeller Institute’s calculation, the gambling revenue figure worked out to about $418 per adult for the Ocean State. And that is indeed the highest in the nation. Nevada ranked second with $407 per adult and Delaware came in third with $397. Our ruling Both reports that Father McKenna referred us to in support of his statement came up short. Not only were they somewhat outdated, but they used flawed numbers and only considered revenues from lotteries and video lottery terminals. But the Rockefeller Institute studies that we found took a comprehensive look at all the major types of gambling. And according to the most recent report, Rhode Island did receive more revenue per adult than any other state in fiscal 2010. The reverend rolled the dice on this one and lady luck was on his side. We rule his statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-07613	"The Congressional Budget Office has this economic model where they measure the economy going forward, and they are now telling us that the entire economy crashes in the year 2037 because their computer simulation can't conceive of any way in which the U.S. economy can continue."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/21/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-cbo-model-self-destructs-due-rising/	Recently, House Budget chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., allowed journalists from CNN to attend a closed-door briefing that he held for fellow Republican lawmakers. One comment Ryan made during his presentation caught our eye. "The Congressional Budget Office has this economic model where they measure the economy going forward, and they are now telling us that the entire economy crashes in the year 2037 because their computer simulation can't conceive of any way in which the U.S. economy can continue," Ryan said, according to the CNN report, which also included a video clip of the comment. We wondered whether Ryan was accurately describing what the CBO -- Congress’ non-partisan fiscal-analysis office -- was saying. We found that Ryan has a point about the peril facing the economy from the nation’s rapidly growing debt, but we also found that his comment was somewhat exaggerated. We turned to several economists, including liberals and conservatives, to see whether they knew of evidence that might support Ryan’s statement. They pointed to several documents that shed light on the claim. One was the CBO’s analysis of Ryan’s own budget "roadmap," published in early 2010. The report compared Ryan’s proposal to a CBO model that takes the current baseline budget numbers and adjusts them to account for a number of policy changes, most of which are expected to be enacted. This can be considered an approximation of the status-quo. Analyzing this status-quo model, the CBO wrote that "it is not possible to simulate the effects … after 2058 because deficits become so large and unsustainable that the model cannot calculate their effects." (The CBO went on to write that, compared to the status-quo option, Ryan’s plan did a better job of bringing down the debt and promoting economic output.) Still, the year this economic model essentially blows up, according to CBO, is 2058 -- 21 years later than what Ryan said in the CNN clip. Subsequent estimates, with new data and revised methodologies, produced different -- and more dire -- conclusions. The CBO published a document called the Long-Term Budget Outlook in June 2010 and then revised it in August 2010. Like the analysis of Ryan’s plan, this study also used multiple models to analyze the future fiscal and economic picture. The CBO cautioned that one of these economic models breaks down if debt were continue to accrue indefinitely. "The economic model used for this comparison is capable of estimating outcomes only under sustainable government policies," the CBO wrote, referring to policies that rein in the debt rather than letting it spiral out of control. Under the August revision, the CBO says this model functions through at least 2035. Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said it’s plausible that the model could implode as early as the 2030s, though he added that other models analyzed by the CBO do not predict an implosion that soon. So the CBO has used a variety of models to analyze the future state of the economy, and some of them suggest serious problems for the economy within the next few decades. But there’s uncertainty about whether any of the CBO models specifically fail by 2037, as Ryan says, and his language -- that the "entire economy crashes" -- is probably a bit too apocalyptic given the uncertainties of the modeling. Our experts added a few other caveats. The model Ryan is referring to is based on the assumption that no policy changes are made to reduce the debt. Even though lawmakers have typically been loath to touch the main drivers of the nation’s debt burden -- entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare -- some economists said that it was unrealistic that politicians would simply let the economy implode rather than making changes to stave off that fate. "This one is same category as shouting, ‘If you keep going like this, you're going to end up the Pacific Ocean’ to someone headed west from New Jersey," said Dean Baker, a liberal economist. "It is absolutely true, but in an absurd way." Baker said that the CBO does long-term budget projections that assume that "Congress never does anything even as the debt increases, pushing up interest payments, leading to ever-larger deficits. … I'm not sure what Ryan thinks that he is showing by this. It is almost inconceivable that we would ever see anything like this." The models the CBO uses are just that -- models. Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that he agrees that the economy is in danger, but not necessarily for the reasons laid out in the model. He thinks the general burden of government will be more of a defining factor than deficits or debt per se. "The real issue is whether the CBO model makes sense," Mitchell said. "I don't think it does because it is based largely on deficits and debt being the key determinants of economic performance. That's not true, though in extreme cases those factors can be very important. People are right to worry about the long run, even if CBO's methodology is a bit dodgy." So where does this leave us? We’ll start by listing the exaggerations in Ryan’s statement. First, he implies that there’s only one CBO model, glossing over the fact that the agency uses multiple models that have produced varying results. Second, Ryan predicts a collapse in 2037, but there’s considerable variation in the doomsday year depending on the model the CBO uses and the data it plugs into its calculations. Third, Ryan’s statement assumes that no change will be made from current policies before a collapse -- an assumption that’s unlikely. And fourth, his claim that the CBO’s "computer simulation can't conceive of any way in which the U.S. economy can continue" strikes us as an overstatement. In fact, the CBO finds lots of unpalatable scenarios if things get bad enough, but the agency doesn’t go so far as to suggest that the economy will simply cease functioning. Economies are far more complex than any single model, so just because a model stops working, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the economy will bring us back to hunter-gatherer days when the model stops working. What saves Ryan’s comment is that, despite his exaggerations, his general point is valid. The economists we spoke to agreed that that the nation’s current path of deficits and debt, if not altered, will become unsustainable. "The issue is simply that under current law, the debt-to-GDP ratio soars so high that economic models break down," said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "The truth is that nobody really knows what would happen as the debt-to-GDP ratio pushes through 100 percent on the way to 200 or 300 percent. The models certainly are not capable of anticipating the effects. But you don't have to have an economic model to appreciate the clear picture of fiscal Armageddon." Generally, then, Ryan’s oversimplifications and exaggerations lead us to downgrade our rating, but his broader point about the perils of the debt for the nation’s economy remains accurate. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2011-03-21T12:20:02	2011-03-18	['United_States']
pomt-05788	"The majority of Americans are conservatives."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/24/marco-rubio/majority-americans-are-conservative-marco-rubio-sa/	EDITOR'S NOTE: An analysis of this claim by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was published on Feb. 14, 2012. After it appeared, we heard from many readers who argued that our rating of Mostly True was the wrong call. The debate centered on whether to judge Rubio on his literal statement or the underlying point. We try to balance that question in many of our rulings. Upon further discussion, and bolstered by more reporting, we have decided to change this ruling to Half True. (The original item is archived here.) U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio had some fun at the expense of liberal opponents at the 2012 Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., by riffing on how he knew the majority of Americans are conservative. "You know, somebody asked me: ‘How do you know that? How do you know Americans are majority conservative?’ Here’s why: How come liberals never admit that they are liberals? They never admit it. They’ve now come up with a new word called progressive, which I thought was an insurance company, but apparently it’s a label." A few minutes later, he noted that Republicans argue over who is most like Ronald Reagan. But, he added, "the Democrats never fight about who is more like Jimmy Carter." Here, we wanted to focus on Rubio’s claim that the majority of Americans are conservatives. We found three sets of reputable polls that were comprehensive and addressed voter ideology. Before we get to those polls, we should note two important precautions about considering the data. First, it matters how questions get asked. In this case, it particularly matters which options a pollster offers for answers to a given question. Second, political ideology is not the same as party affiliation.These days, people split Republican and Democrat pretty evenly, with the answer "independent" garnering significant support. But here, we’re looking at political ideology on a liberal to conservative scale. The Gallup poll The Gallup poll has been regularly asking Americans about their political ideology since 1992, and it compiles the results of many polls each year and releases an annual report. Several pollsters told us they think Gallup is the most reputable on this question because of its unusually large sample size. For 2011, Gallup found that the largest group of Americans identify as conservative, at 40 percent. Another 35 percent identify as moderate, while 21 percent identify as liberal. That trend has fluctuated a bit over the years, with moderates sometimes slightly outnumbering liberals. But liberals have consistently numbered much less. (See Gallup’s chart for the clear contrast.) In Gallup’s poll, the number of conservatives has never crossed the 50 percent threshold. So even though conservative is the No. 1 answer, it commands only a plurality, not a majority. As we noted above, Gallup found that more Americans than ever identify as political independents, at 40 percent. The Democratic Party, claiming the allegiance of 31 percent of Americans, is second, followed by Republicans, with 27 percent. When Gallup asked people which party they lean toward, the independents split so that the country is almost evenly divided. For the year of 2011, Gallup reported that 45 percent of Americans identified as Republicans or leaned that way, while 45 percent identified as Democrats or leaned that way. American National Election Studies data Every four years coinciding with presidential elections, the American National Election Studies (ANES) project conducts detailed voter surveys. The project is currently a partnership between Stanford University and the University of Michigan. Since 1972, pollsters have asked voters to place themselves along an ideological continuum. Pollsters offer seven potential political affiliations: extremely liberal; liberal; slightly liberal; moderate or middle of the road; slightly conservative; conservative; or extremely conservative. As an eighth possibility, pollsters asked, "or haven't you thought much about this?" In 2008, 32 percent placed themselves on the conservative side; 25 percent said they hadn’t thought much about it; 22 percent chose the liberal side; and 22 percent said they were moderate. The Battleground Poll Yet another longstanding poll that asks about political ideology is the POLITICO-George Washington University Battleground Poll. This poll asks voters simply if they are conservative or liberal, without offering the choice of moderate or centrist. The bipartisan poll is conducted by Republican pollster Ed Goeas of The Tarrance Group and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake of Lake Research Partners. The pollsters have asked about ideology since 1991. Goeas said the pollsters purposefully don’t offer moderate because it gives people a "safe haven" where they don’t have to think about tough political questions. Lake said they deliberately don’t offer "moderate" because it becomes a default answer and is less predictive of voting behavior. In the most recent poll, conducted in November 2011, 61 percent said they were conservative while 34 percent said liberal. Another 2 percent volunteered the answer "moderate," while 3 percent said they were unsure or didn’t know. Pollster Ed Goeas said those results have been fairly consistent since 1991. "I've never seen ‘conservative’ below 57 percent," he said. "‘Liberal’ has always been in the 33, 34 percent range. ... I don't think I've ever seen it more than 38 percent." The number of people who volunteered the answer "moderate" has never gone above 10 percent, he said. Other pollsters weigh in As we were interviewing pollsters and looking for more polling data, we gathered some interesting insights. Mark Mellman, a pollster for Democrats, said conservatives never cross the 50-percent threshold when moderate is offered as an option, and moderate always should be offered. "Questions need to contain the range of relevant alternatives in order to be ‘valid,’" he said via email. "The real question is, so what?" he added. "Identification with these broad general terms is only loosely correlated with people’s views on any particular substantive issue … Saying more people are conservative than liberal tells us nothing about their views on taxing the wealthy, protecting Medicare, protecting the environment or any other of a host of issues." Robert Blendon of Harvard University, who specializes in polling on health care policy; said he prefers the Gallup poll numbers when thinking about political ideology, but added, "I’ve never seen a poll that doesn’t show more conservatives than liberals," he said. Sometimes, the conservatives and moderates may exchange first and second places, though. Karlyn Bowman of the conservative American Enterprise Institute distills the results of many polls on similar topics. She said she thought Rubio was on the right track with his comments. "Ideologically, we are more conservative than liberal, and that’s consistent across the polls," she said. Our ruling Rubio said that the majority of Americans are conservative. Two of the three pollls show that while conservatives are a plurality, they are short of a majority. Rubio can't claim majority status because a significant share of the electorate identifies itself as moderate. In the one poll that gives voters two choices -- liberal or conservative -- conservatives have consistently been the majority. So by the two polls, he was incorrect. By one, he was correct and we find support for his underlying point that there are more conservatives than liberals. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-15347	Says his "average federal tax rate" was 36 percent.	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/jul/09/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-his-average-federal-tax-rate-was-36-/	When former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush released 33 years of tax returns, he suggested we are all paying too much in taxes -- himself included. "I paid the government more than one in three dollars that I earned in my career," Bush wrote on his campaign website June 30. "Astounding. The total effective rate was 36 percent. I think I speak for everyone, no matter your tax rate: We need to get more money back in your pocket and less in the federal kitty." A chart highlighted Bush’s "average federal tax rate" as 36 percent. Was Bush’s average federal tax rate 36 percent over the years? It was a figure that drew attention and criticism. We found that it depends on how you calculate it. Bush’s tax rate Bush arrived at that 36 percent average by weighting his income -- so higher income and tax rate years counted more than the years when he earned far less -- including four years when he paid nothing in taxes and therefore had a zero tax rate. In fact, Bush didn’t start paying a rate of 36 percent or higher until he left office in 2007. Bush showed his annual tax rate for every year from 1981 through 2013. (He filed for an extension for 2014.) His footnotes explained that Bush was citing an effective federal tax rate calculated by dividing cumulative total tax paid by cumulative total taxable income. Abraham N.M. Shashy, Jr., former chief counsel for the Internal Revenue Service, calculated the rate for Bush. Bush’s income went up and down while he was in the private sector before he ran for governor for the first time in 1994. Later, it would drop while he was in the governor’s mansion from January 1999 through January 2007 and then rise again when he left office. As his income fluctuated, so did his tax rate. During the 1980s, Bush’s tax rate was usually less than 24 percent. For four years, his taxable income was either zero or negative as a result of losses taken on real estate and business investments while he worked with Miami real estate developer Armando Codina. His income surpassed $1 million for the first time in 1990. During the 1990s his tax rate ranged from 27 to 33 percent. Bush’s income dropped while in office from 1999 through January 2007 and then soared from $260,000 in 2006 to $7.4 million in 2013. Since 2007, his rate has ranged from 36 to 40 percent. So that means that Bush’s rate only exceeded that 35 percent for seven of his 33 years of tax returns. Whether 36 percent was his average rate depends on a few factors, including what we should count as income to determine the rate. Some of the tax experts we interviewed came up with different calculations or disagreed with how Bush calculated his rate. Here are the issues they raised: Weighted average: On this point, we found some disagreement about whether Bush used the best method or not. Bush used a weighted average, which counts the higher-earning years more than others. When we did a straight up average by adding up all the rates that Bush reported, we got an average of about 24.5 percent. Michael Kitces, a financial planning and tax expert who writes the Nerd’s Eye View blog, did his own analysis using a different income line on tax returns and calculated that Bush’s average rate was 21.3 percent. Rebecca Wilkins, a tax expert and executive director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said the weighted average is more accurate. "It reflects what you are paying in taxes overall and doesn’t get skewed by unusual years," she said. Asawath Damodaran, a finance professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said that these methods simply reflect two different ways of calculating taxes. "One is not right and the other wrong," he said. Although Bush cited his average, his website includes the rate for each individual year. Payroll taxes: Experts we interviewed said that Bush should not have included payroll taxes in his income tax calculation. Wilkins subtracted Bush’s payroll tax and found that his effective rate was 36 percent for 2013 -- not the 40 percent he cited. And when she averaged the rate for the past five years without the payroll taxes, she found an average of 33 percent. Taxable income: Bush used taxable income, which subtracts deductions, to calculate his rate. Here’s an example of how using taxable income rather than total income can skew the tax rate, as Kitces pointed out to PolitiFact. In 1984, Bush’s total income was $44,626 while after his deductions his taxable income was $11,276. So by dividing the $1,961 in taxes paid by the $11,276, we get the rate of 17 percent that Bush claimed. However, if we use the actual income figure of $44,626, his rate would have been 4 percent. Retirement money excluded: Roberton Williams at the Tax Policy Center says that Bush underestimated how much he earned because he omitted that his firm contributed millions to retirement accounts. (The Wall Street Journal reported that labor filings showed that the firm’s pension plan had assets of $2.4 million as of the end of 2013.) "The bottom line is they have chosen the smallest measure of income they could use, and therefore calculated the largest tax rate they could get," Williams said. Not accounting for inflation: A more valid way to calculate the rate would be to inflate the dollars each year up to 2013 dollars and then determine the rate. That would cause the overall average effective tax rate to drop by a bit more than half a percentage point, Williams said. When Williams used adjusted gross income in place of taxable income that made it drop about another 1.5 percentage points. So when Williams adjusted for inflation and used the adjusted gross income, he calculated Bush’s average rate at 33.7 percent. We shared a summary of our findings from other tax experts with Bush’s campaign and asked why they used the method they used. "Our calculation of the average effective tax rate Gov. Bush paid over 33 years takes into account his complete federal tax burden, which we believe any calculation of effective tax rate should aim to do," said Allie Brandenburger, a spokeswoman for Bush’s campaign. "The 36 percent rate addresses all federal taxes, and presents the clearest and most accurate picture of Gov. Bush’s effective tax paid." Our ruling Bush said his average federal tax rate was 36 percent. That’s the number that results if we use the method he did to calculate his taxes based on his taxable income, including payroll taxes and weighting the average to give more weight to the higher income years. However, there are other ways to calculate his average rate that would result in a lower number. For example, one way is adjusting for inflation and using a different measure of income, which lowered the rate to 33.7 percent. Other methods led to rates of 24.5 percent or 21.3 percent. Experts say it depends on what method you use. Overall, Bush did pay higher tax rates when he made more money. But he seems to have chosen a method of calculating his tax rate that results in the highest possible number. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07764	"FACT: the ‘special assistant’ in @johnkasich's office makes over three times more than an average #OH firefighter"	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/24/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-claims-top-kasich-makes-trip/	Columbus politics is dominated at the moment by a fiery debate over a proposal to overhaul collective bargaining laws for public workers. Known as Senate Bill 5, the legislation is drawing raucous crowds to the normally serene Statehouse atrium. Republican Gov. John Kasich, backed by a Republican-controlled legislature, wants to end collective bargaining for state workers and abate the ability of city workers, including firefighters and police officers, to bargain for pay and benefits. Republican leaders say such reforms are needed to lower costs and ease the financial burden on the state and city budgets. Democratic leaders, flanked by a few Republcian office holders and lots of labor leaders, argue that teachers and firefighters and other union workers are not overpaid and that collective bargaining keeps both workers and employers in check at a minimal cost. The Ohio Democratic Party on Feb. 14 boiled down its argument in a Twitter message. Both the brevity and first word of the tweet caught Politifact Ohio’s attention: "FACT: the ‘special assistant’ in @johnkasich's office makes over three times more than an average #OH firefighter" Given the debate that rages on behind the tweet, we thought it was worth checking out. The tweet refers to Jai Chabria, a senior advisor, or special assistant, to Kasich, says ODP communications director Seth Bringman. Chabria, who worked with Kasich at the defunct Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers, is part of governor’s inner-circle, whose members are paid six-figure salaries, a point that received a good bit of attention earlier this year. Chabria’s annual salary is $145,000 and is not subject to any collective bargaining deal. He serves at the pleasure of the governor. ODP’s Bringman says the tweet also refers to the average annual salary of an Ohio firefighter of $41,160. He cities the Bureau of Labor Statistics as the tweet’s source. The bureau indeed shows that the mean, or average, salary of an Ohio firefighter is $41,160. The figure does not include benefits and is based on the data compiled in May 2009, the latest available. It’s important to note that the figure, however, is based on six surveys of 200,000 employers collected over a three-year period, not on an actual accounting of every Ohio firefighter’s salary. Looking for something more current, Politifact Ohio compared the bureau’s survey data to actual salary data collected by the Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund, which manages the retirement plans for safety officers. Spokesman David Graham says the fund doesn’t track the average salary of an Ohio firefighter but actual raw data is compiled in actuary reports. According to one such report in 2010 by Buck Consultants, there are 13,001 full-time fire personnel in Ohio whose collective annual salary totaled $860,966,828. Dividing the total salary by the number of personnel produces an average annual salary of $66,000. The actuary reports also reveal that firefighters with one-year of experience are paid an average salary of $45,000. Fire personnel with 40 years of experience can earn $80,000. The data can also be sliced numerous other ways to produce a range of salary figures. But the pension fund figures also include other ranking officers, like captains or chiefs, who earn more and would raise the average. The data also doesn’t separate firefighters who are cross-trained as paramedics or in hazardous materials and typically earn more than others firefighters. "It includes the fire chief from Cleveland to the firefighter from Piqua," Graham said. He couldn’t say exactly what ranks and specialties are in the latest figures but said captains and others all qualify under Ohio Revised Code as firefighters and therefore are members of the pension fund. So where does this leave the Ohio Democratic Party’s tweet on the Truth-O-Meter? Chabria’s salary of $145,000 is more than three times the salary figure of $41,160 that the party cited. And its based on widely accepted data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is widely regarded as a reliable source for statistics. But it’s important to know that some of that data, collected in surveys, is several years old. Chabria’s salary is also more than three times the average salary of a firefighter with one year of experience, according to the Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund’s actuary reports. (But only 3.7 percent of current firefighters had 1 year of experience, the report shows.) While we would like to have more current data, the overall pension fund numbers are skewed because they also include pay figures from higher ranking, higher paid officers. All of this also underscores the point often made by the Politifact: Statistics often need illumination. We rate the tweet as Mostly True.

pomt-09200	The Republican Party "fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed, as well as the voting rights bill."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/25/michael-steele/steele-says-gop-fought-hard-civil-rights-bills-196/	When Rand Paul of Kentucky followed up his victory in the May 18, 2010, Republican U.S. Senate primary by saying that he had some reservations about the philosophical underpinnings of the Civil Rights Act, it prompted criticism from across the ideological spectrum. "I like the Civil Rights Act in a sense that it ended discrimination in all public domains," Paul said in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. "I abhor racism. I think it's a bad business decision to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant. But at the same time, I do believe in private ownership. There's 10 different titles, you know, to the Civil Rights Act. One deals with private institutions, and had I been around, I would have tried to modify that." Paul eventually retracted his comments, but they nonetheless sparked a media frenzy. On ABC's This Week, Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele -- his party's first African-American chairman -- made a point of arguing that his party had been on the forefront of civil rights when the landmark act Rand was referring to was passed in 1964, as well as the Voting Rights Act that passed the following year. "Our party has always had a strong view on this issue," Steele told ABC's Jake Tapper. "We fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill." We decided to see whether Steele was correct. The Civil Rights Act -- which is best known for barring discrimination in public accommodations -- passed the House on Feb. 10, 1964 by a margin of 290-130. When broken down by party, 61 percent of Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill (152 yeas and 96 nays), and a full 80 percent of the Republican caucus supported it (138 yeas and 34 nays). When the Senate passed the measure on June 19, 1964, -- nine days after supporters mustered enough votes to end the longest filibuster in Senate history -- the margin was 73-27. Better than two-thirds of Senate Democrats supported the measure on final passage (46 yeas, 21 nays), but an even stronger 82 percent of Republicans supported it (27 yeas, 6 nays). The primary reason that Republican support was higher than Democratic support -- even though the legislation was pushed hard by a Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson -- is that the opposition to the bill primarily came from Southern lawmakers. In the mid 1960s, the South was overwhelmingly Democratic -- a legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction, when the Republican Party was the leading force against slavery and its legacy. Because of this history, the Democratic Party in the 1960s was divided between Southern Democrats, most of whom opposed civil rights legislation, and Democrats from outside the South who more often than not supported it. This pattern showed clearly in the House vote. Northern Democrats backed the Civil Rights Act by a margin even larger than that of Republicans -- 141 for, just four against -- while Southern Democrats were strongly opposed, by a margin of 11 yeas to 92 nays. When the Voting Rights Act hit the floor in 1965, the vote results mirrored those of the Civil Rights Act. In the House, the measure passed by a 333-85 margin, with 78 percent of Democrats backing it (221 yeas and 61 nays) and 82 percent of Republicans backing it (112 yeas to 24 nays). In the Senate, the measure passed by a 77-19 vote, with 73 percent of Democrats and 94 percent of Republicans supporting the bill. So it's clear that Republican support for both bills was deep. But to make sure we weren't missing something, we contacted a number of scholars who have studied that period, asking whether Republicans were dragged into supporting the bills reluctantly, or whether they took frontline roles in advancing them. Generally speaking, the scholars we talked to agreed that Republicans were important players, usually working cooperatively with Johnson and other leading Democrats. Democrats deserve credit for being the driving force behind the legislation, our experts said, particularly Johnson, who had only been in office for three months yet who staked his own re-election prospects on a tough, divisive legislative battle. Other crucial Democratic players were Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana and Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, who had been championing the issue of civil rights for a decade and a half. But Republicans took leading positions as well, including Rep. Charles (Mac) Mathias of Maryland and Sen. Jacob Javits of New York. And during the 1950s, a Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower, had supported a civil rights legislation, though he never signed anything as sweeping as either the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act. In the strategic challenge of getting the Civil Rights Act passed, Democrats knew that they would need to reach out to Republicans in order to overcome their own party's splits on the issue -- especially in the Senate, where a determined minority of one-third of the chamber could block consideration of a bill. (Today that number is two-fifths.) The key to Senate passage of the Civil Rights Act was winning the support of Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, R-Ill., our experts said. By various accounts, Dirksen had some reservations with certain provisions of the Civil Rights Act, but Mansfield and Humphrey "worked very closely" with him, and "key parts of the bill were worked out in Dirksen’s office in the evenings," said U.S. Senate Historian Donald A. Ritchie. Other midwestern Republicans followed Dirksen's lead and supported the bill. Once the filibuster was broken, Time magazine put Dirksen on its cover. "You can gauge Everett Dirksen and the Republicans in various ways, but you have to give them real credit," said University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis, who called Dirksen "a tough, veteran politician, and a pragmatist of the first order." To be sure, Republican support was not unanimous. Most notably, the party's 1964 presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater, voted against the Civil Rights Act and stuck to that position during the campaign (which he lost to Johnson in a landslide). And Yale University political scientist David Mayhew notes that the large Republican vote totals for the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act were not replicated in other key civil rights battles, such as an earlier one relating to fair employment practices in 1949 and 1950 and a subsequent one on fair housing in 1966. But on the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, the most notable factor affecting how Republicans voted was pragmatism, said Bert Rockman, a political scientist at Purdue University. "The Republicans of that era deserve credit, lots of it, but less in a partisan way than in a now long-lost art form – forging a consensus around critical national problems." Back to Steele's quote: "We fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill." The degree of Republican support for the two bills actually exceeded the degree of Democratic support, and it's also fair to say that Republicans took leading roles in both measures, even though they had far fewer seats, and thus less power, at the time. Both of these factors are enough to earn Steele a rating of True.	None	Michael Steele	None	None	None	2010-05-25T17:18:46	2010-05-23	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-02697	In altered photo, says Barack Obama wants "more of Texans’ private data" via health care.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/03/david-dewhurst/some-tax-info-most-texans-some-health-info-subset-/	Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, campaigning for re-election, tweeted a parody of President Barack Obama promoting his signature health-care law. Around midday Dec. 12, 2013, the official White House Twitter account posted a photo of Obama holding a sign urging Americans to get health coverage because "nobody should go broke just because they get sick." Social media denizens started creating versions that rewrote the sign’s text; Dewhurst’s had Obama saying, "I want more of Texans’ private data." Some perspective: Texas in 2012 had approximately 19.5 million insured residents and 5.2 million legal residents without insurance according to a March 18, 2013, report by the state Health and Human Services Commission. Does the Obamacare law demand private data on them that wasn't known to the government before? PolitiFact reporters have checked out several claims about how the Affordable Care Act’s online marketplaces will handle personal information. Many of the concerns addressed are about how government agencies will share information they already collect -- and how secure that information will be. As part of a May 2013 fact-check, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., reported that a federal "data hub" resulting from the 2010 law would pull information from government agencies, but not expand federal data collection. For example, the Social Security Administration is asked to verify a person's Social Security number, and the IRS confirms financial data to see if a person is eligible for a subsidy. PolitiFact in D.C. gave a False rating Sept. 19, 2013, to a claim by former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey that "Obamacare will question your sex life," finding that nothing in the health care law required such questions. So what information does the government collect under the Obamacare law? If you apply to shop in the federal online insurance marketplace or the marketplace for your state, you’ll supply information on yourself and perhaps family members, some of which the government already has. Healthcare.gov offers a checklist for people preparing to fill out applications, whether online or printed: Social Security number, employer, income, current insurance policy numbers and information about your employer’s insurance plans (if any). Such answers will help determine whether you’re eligible to buy insurance through the marketplaces and if you can get free- or reduced-cost coverage via tax credits, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. The standardized family application asks for information on you and everyone who lives with you, including whether you are pregnant and how many babies you’re expecting, whether you have a health condition that limits daily activities, whether you live in a nursing home and whether you were in foster care after age 18. Other questions concern employment, military service, sources of income, tax deductions taken and whether you are American Indian or Alaska Native. A Sept. 18, 2013, fact sheet from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said, "Personal health information (PHI) will be requested only when it is needed to complete the application and make an eligibility determination for health coverage options." Health privacy expert Deven McGraw told us by email that the applications do collect some information the government did not already have, but said it’s the same type of information gathered when people apply for public coverage such as Medicaid. "They are questions that are specifically designed to match eligibility criteria. So none of it is extraneous," said McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates for Internet freedom. And, she said, the data can’t be used for any purposes other than the marketplaces’ functions. More information about you could come, the fact sheet says, from "common federal data sources including the Social Security Administration (SSA), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)." Wait -- Homeland Security? According to the National Immigration Law Center’s website, applicants who are not U.S. citizens will have their status verified through a Homeland/U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service database. Agencies already use the web service, called Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE), to determine immigrants’ eligibility for benefits including Medicaid, housing loans and unemployment. Via email, Social Security spokeswoman Kia Anderson told us her agency can, when CMS needs the information to determine eligibility, provide applicants’ ID numbers, citizenship data, death or disability indicators and Social Security income and coverage earned. So the application process puts together some information the government already had with some it didn’t have. People who aren’t applying to shop in the marketplaces but are subject to the Obamacare law’s mandate will also be sharing some new information with Uncle Sam. The mandate to have or get insurance applies, according to the immigration law center, to all U.S. citizens, naturalized citizens and legal immigrants. Via email, IRS spokeswoman Lea Crusberg said 2014 tax returns will ask whether you have health coverage that meets the new standards or an exemption, whether you got coverage through an Obamacare marketplace and whether you got a tax credit to help defray the cost. The law’s new tax payments and credits will also be on returns, of course. In 2015, Crusberg said, the IRS will start collecting coverage information from insurance providers. Employers who insure their own workers in-house will report which employees are enrolled and give enough information so the IRS can tell if those workers are due a tax credit. Self-insuring employers will also put the cost of the plan they’re providing on W-2 forms so workers can see it. Is the new data "private" information? Per the CMS fact sheet, Obamacare applicants could be asked to cough up some personal health information. But the fact sheet also says the marketplaces’ systems "will not store this information" -- which casts some doubt on whether the government is really "collecting" it, but serves as an indication that it’s considered sensitive. How about when the IRS asks where your insurance comes from, whether you got a tax credit for it and whether it meets the Obamacare law’s standards? Generally, the IRS regards what you put on your tax return as private. For example, tax preparers who disclose such information without your consent can face criminal charges. Final IRS regulations governing who can disclose what tax return information to HHS under the Obamacare law were issued Aug. 13, 2013. An FAQ posted by the IRS that day said that "officers and employees of the IRS will disclose to HHS, the Marketplace, and state agencies only, upon written request and subject to strict privacy and security rules, certain return information ... for the purpose of determining eligibility for certain health care affordability programs." Our ruling Dewhurst said Obama wants "more of Texans’ private data." The subset of Texans shopping for coverage through the online marketplace are providing additional private data for a reason: to ensure they’re qualified. Dewhurst's statement overlooks these aspects. Regardless, many more Texans will be asked to give the IRS information about their health coverage that was previously not requested. We rate Dewhurst’s statement as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-00443	"We need an ID" to "buy a beer."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/22/brad-schimel/despite-brad-schimels-claim-wisconsin-you-dont-nee/	It’s hard to imagine how many thousands of times a day someone in Wisconsin, without having to prove who they are, buys a beer at a bar or a restaurant. Or, for that matter, at a baseball stadium, a church festival or any number of other places in the Beer State — er, Badger State. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. So, it was puzzling to see the state’s top law enforcement officer — speaking in the context of the state law that requires photo identification to vote — claim that "we need an ID" to "buy a beer." The claim Brad Schimel’s claim came in a video attached to a tweet from what is labeled as his campaign Twitter account. The tweet was posted on Aug. 12, 2018, two days before Wisconsin’s primary elections. Schimel ran unopposed in the Republican primary, seeking re-election as the state attorney general, where he leads the Department of Justice (DOJ). The text of Schimel’s tweet noted that Wisconsin law requires a photo identification to vote. The reference to beer comes in the 40-second video, which also focuses on the voter ID law and was produced as part of his re-election campaign. Tweets: In Wisconsin, "300,000 voters were turned away by the state’s strict voter ID law" in the 2016 presidential election. False. The video begins with words on the screen, echoed by a narrator, that say: Integrity. It matters at the DOJ. And it matters at the ballot box. That’s why Wisconsin voters have said time and again voter ID protects our votes. We need an ID to rent a car, buy a beer, check out a library book. It’s common sense to prove our identity when we vote. Need a photo ID to buy a beer? What the law requires Schimel campaign spokesman Johnny Koremenos, who has also worked as Schimel’s official spokesman at the Department of Justice, defended Schimel’s statement by telling us that getting asked for an ID to buy beer "is commonplace in bars, liquor stores, and grocery stores across the state. In fact, some stores have policies to ID everybody, regardless of whether age has shown its physical signs or not." Well, sure. But Schimel didn’t say you might be carded. He said -- likening it to casting a ballot at the polls -- that you need an ID to buy a beer. Article: Does Wisconsin’s new voter ID law ‘disenfranchise’ voters? In its publication about alcohol laws for retailers, the state Department of Revenue says retailers should demand proof of age of anyone "who appears to be under the legal drinking age." That is, 21. And the law on alcohol beverages says sellers may require a customer to provide ID. But the law does not require that identification be provided to buy a beer. As those of us well beyond 21 well know, there are countless times at countless venues where we’ve bought beer without having to show an ID. Which is something you can’t get away with at the polling place if you want to vote. Our rating Schimel says: "We need an ID" to "buy a beer." It’s a particularly misleading statement in the context in which the attorney general made it — citing the state law that requires a photo ID in order to vote. In some places, especially if you look like you might be younger than 21, you might be required to show an ID in order to buy beer. But state law does not require people who want to buy a beer to produce an ID — as many Wisconsin beer drinkers have known for many years. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Schimel a Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Brad Schimel	None	None	None	2018-08-22T06:00:00	2018-08-12	['None']
pomt-04746	"Last month, 44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-44-50-states-last-month-saw-unem/	Continuing the Republican Party’s attacks on President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took aim at the state-by-state jobless statistics during his opening-night speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa. "Last month," he said, "44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate." We decided to check whether this was accurate by looking up the most recent monthly state employment data published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. We found that Walker has counted correctly -- but he’s cherry-picked the numbers in a way that puts the most negative spin on the data. First, many of the increases were so small that they were statistically insignificant. If something is statistically insignificant, that means it’s so small that you can’t be certain the change actually happened. According to BLS, only 18 of the 44 states with a rise in unemployment between June 2012 and July 2012 had increases that were statistically significant. The remaining 26 were too small for anyone to be certain that a change actually happened. Typically these states had increases of two-tenths of a percentage point or less. Second, there’s another way to look at the data -- not looking from one month to the next, but looking from July 2011 to one year later, July 2012. Using this methodology, there were 18 states with statistically significant changes, of which 17 saw the unemployment rate decrease. Only one state increased. Finally, it’s worth noting that the most recent figures are preliminary and may be adjusted. This increases the level of uncertainty in month-to-month comparisons. "The month-to-month changes shouldn't generally be interpreted as being that tightly related to policy -- you want to look at longer-run trends for that, like year-on-year changes," said Tara Sinclar, a George Washington University economist. Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, said Walker has a point. "Both the state-level and national-level unemployment rates suggest there was some weakening of the job market in July compared with June," Burtless said. And the fact that each of the 18 statistically significant changes in the unemployment was upward supports the point. Still, Burtless added that a different BLS report, the national employer survey estimate of job creation, showed a 163,000-job increase nationally in July, suggesting a strengthening job market. "If one wanted to judge Gov. Walker’s statement harshly," Burtless said, "one might say it is ‘true, but incomplete.’" (PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Our ruling Walker’s statement that "last month, 44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate" is accurate, but it lacks some important context. In only 18 states, not 44, was the increase statistically significant. And longer-term employment data, particularly the year-over-year statistics, shows that the labor market has improved, suggesting that the labor picture is more complex than Walker’s claim would indicate. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-08-29T16:54:53	2012-08-28	['None']
pomt-00912	"America produces more oil and gas than any other nation in the world."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/mar/02/rick-perry/perry-says-us-no-1-producer-oil-and-gas/	Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry headlined a fundraising dinner for the Republican Party of Virginia with a speech that, among other things, called for greater U.S. energy production. Perry was miffed by President Barack Obama’s recent veto of legislation that would have authorized construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, a project that would allow oil to flow from Canadian tar sands to U.S. refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. Perry stepped down as governor in January and is exploring a bid for the GOP presidential nomination. "One of the fastest ways to create growth and opportunity is to tap into this great energy opportunity, the great energy resources that we have in this country," Perry told the crowd at the Richmond Marriott on Feb. 24. "With the advent of new technology, new innovation, it’s allowed energy companies to access shale formations. America produces more oil and gas than any other nation in the world -- more than Russia, more than Saudi Arabia." We took a look at Perry’s contention that the U.S. is No. 1 in oil and gas production. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National examined a similar claim made in January by the very person Perry was criticizing -- Obama. Perry’s camp did not respond to four requests for back-up information. So we turned to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which compiles data on overall oil production, a category that includes not just crude oil, but also biofuels like ethanol, natural gas liquids and other liquids. Under that comprehensive measure, the U.S. produced 14.275 million barrels of oil a day in the third quarter of last year -- the most current figures available. That was tops in the world, ahead No. 2 producer Saudi Arabia, which tapped 11.6 million barrels a day. Russia was No. 3, producing 10.8 million barrels a day during the quarter. The U.S. has led Saudi Arabia in daily oil production since the last three months of 2012. If you look at a narrower field of oil production -- just crude oil without the biofuels and other liquids included -- then the U.S. ranked third, behind Russia and Saudi Arabia. When comparing U.S. oil production to Saudi Arabia, there’s some important context to keep in mind. Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University’s Geopolitics of Energy project, told PolitiFact National that Saudi Arabia has a higher production capacity than the U.S. but chooses not to use it all to avoid glutting the global market. "In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.," Maugeri said. Now, let’s turn to natural gas. In 2012, the most current EIA figures, the U.S. produced 29.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The only nation that came close was Russia, which produced 23 trillion cubic feet. The U.S., which has seen a boost in natural gas from domestic shale production, has been the leader in producing that resource since 1993, when it surpassed Russia. Our ruling Perry said the U.S. produces more oil and natural gas than any other country in the world. EIA figures show he’s correct. We rate his statement True.

pomt-08412	Says Marco Rubio sold a home to a chiropractor who had been lobbying him on automobile insurance legislation and "once he sold the home, for $380,000 cash, the speaker's position on the issue changed."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/20/charlie-crist/crist-attacks-rubios-ethics-over-house-deal-and-in/	By now, religious watchers of Florida's U.S. Senate debates can almost predict the script. No-party Gov. Charlie Crist attacks Republican former House Speaker Marco Rubio over Rubio's proposal to make changes to Social Security. Rubio attacks Crist for false attacks. Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek attacks Crist for flip-flopping on issues like oil drilling and abortion. Someone attacks somebody about health care. Somebody else attacks the other guys about the federal stimulus and its impact. Oh, and Crist agrees with Rubio on extending the Bush-era tax cuts for all. Meek doesn't. The first three Senate debates played out almost identically, and the fourth of six debates Oct. 19, 2010, in South Florida was heading down the same worn path. Then, boom, something new. More than halfway through the debate, Crist implied -- without saying, of course -- that Rubio might have sold a vote on automobile insurance legislation to a chiropractor in 2007 whose mother bought his house. "There's an expression in Washington called pay to play," Crist said, after pivoting away from a question about Jim Greer, the former Republican Party of Florida chairman whom Crist supported and who is now indicted on fraud and grand theft charges. "When (Rubio) was speaker of the Florida House, he had a home, here in Miami in South Florida. It was for sale. And before that sale took place, he was on the other side of a personal injury protection issue. It was a Dr. Cereceda he ended up selling the home to that had an interest in that issue. Once he sold the home, for $380,000 cash, the speaker's position on the issue changed. And all the sudden, miraculously, that bill went through." Returning to the script, Rubio called the allegations untrue. "What the governor said about the sale is categorically false," Rubio said. "If you want the gory details you can go on our website marcorubio.com. It's all outlined there. The house was an arms-length transaction. The gentleman's mom still lives in the home. We actually reduced the price of the home. It had been for sale for months. And my position did not change. Subsequent to the sale of that property, the PIP legislation the governor's talking about failed to pass the Florida House, and it didn't pass until months later when a deal was cut with the Senate to fix it." Since Crist launched the attack, we've decided to analyze his statement. This fact check has two complicated topics -- home sales and auto insurance legislation -- rolled into one. The back story In 2007, in Crist's first year as governor and Rubio's first of two years as House speaker, a state-mandated type of automobile insurance coverage called personal injury protection, or PIP, was set to expire. The mandated $10,000 coverage pays for accident injuries to a driver and passengers regardless of who is at fault and costs the average driver $100 to $200 a year. Crist and the Republican-led Senate wanted to extend the mandated coverage during the spring 2007 session, arguing that the additional coverage protected drivers. Health insurers also supported the extension of PIP because they worried health care would become expensive. Hospitals liked the additional coverage because it helped defray their costs on behalf of patients. But Rubio and some members of the Florida House weren't sold. They believed the current system encouraged too much fraud, and Rubio made clear that without real fraud reforms he would not support extending PIP coverage. The Senate proposal to extend PIP ordered a review of its effectiveness and allocated $2.4 million to fund 30 fraud investigators. That wasn't enough for Rubio. "We have to wipe out fraud. The current PIP system has so much fraud built into it," Rubio said during the 2007 session. "An entire fraud industry has been created and unless that's addressed, there's no need to do anything." What's clear is that Rubio was the key impediment to extending PIP coverage as is or even with minor fraud protections, a position that made him a target of doctors and chiropractors lobbying to support PIP. One of those chiropractors was West Miami's Dr. Mark Cereceda. In the spring and summer of 2007, Cereceda mounted a campaign to pressure Rubio to allow PIP to continue, according to CBS 4 in Miami. Cereceda and other chiropractors met with Rubio in Tallahassee, and Cereceda also helped organize demonstrations in front of Rubio's West Miami office. In June, he rented planes to fly banners over Rubio's home and office urging him to keep PIP alive. (Rubio told a newspaper reporter that the people who hired the airplane "run the fraud industry.") At around the same time, Cereceda was also dealing with Rubio on a personal level, it turns out. Cereceda was his neighbor. And his mother, Nora Cereceda, was buying Rubio's West Miami house. Rubio had purchased the three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,340-square-foot home for $175,000 in February 2003. He sold it in April 2007 for $380,000, all in cash. Nora Cereceda bought the home to live near her son after the death of her husband, Rubio and Cereceda said. PolitiFact Florida examined home sales within a half square mile. As expected there weren't many true comparable sales. A three-bedroom, two-bathroom home totaling 1,413 square feet sold for $332,500 in June 2007. A bigger three-bedroom, two-bathroom home totaling 1,960 square feet three blocks away sold in May 2007 for $373,000. Both homes were about four blocks from Rubio's property. Rubio's sale is listed on the Miami-Dade Property Appraiser as a "qualified" sale, meaning it met the property appraiser's definition of an arms-length transaction. That's jargon that notes that the sale involved a willing seller and a willing buyer, neither under special pressure or incentives, such as selling a home to a family member. PolitiFact Florida left a message for Cereceda that wasn't returned, but previously he told reporters that the home sale was a coincidence and unrelated to his efforts to lobby Rubio to extend PIP coverage. Rubio says the same thing. "She wanted to buy it because she wanted to live across the street from her son," Rubio said. The sale was finalized on April 13. The regular session of the Legislature ended three weeks later on May 4, without an agreement to extend PIP beyond the sunset date of Oct. 1, or any shift in position from Rubio. In the hours after the session ended, Rubio reiterated his primary complaint about fraud. "'I have said all along that we had to have significant fraud reforms," Rubio said. Otherwise he would prefer to let the law sunset. So where does the pay to play accusation/suggestion come in? On Sept. 28, it was Rubio writing to Crist asking that the governor call a special session to address automobile insurance protections. In the letter, Rubio said the House had worked tirelessly to craft sensible and comprehensive anti-fraud legislation. Crist agreed to add personal injury protection laws to an Oct. 3 special session regarding the state budget. On Oct. 5, a PIP compromise was struck and the bill extending the mandatory coverage passed. The final bill, which passed the House 105-4 (Rubio voted yes) and the Senate 37-0, included three measures meant to cut down on fraud. The legislation limited prices some medical facilities and doctors can charge insurers for nonemergency care. It also required that PIP clinics be owned or overseen by licensed doctors. Lawmakers also agreed to add $2 million to the state budget to hire more anti-fraud prosecutors. Rubio said the compromise better guarded against fraud. But to be sure, PIP fraud remains a major problem. The Division of Insurance Fraud received more than 5,500 complaints of PIP fraud during fiscal year 2009-2010, more than 40 percent of all fraud complaints. Investigators made 337 arrests that resulted in 240 convictions. In 2006-2007, the final full year before the reforms, the state received 3,600 complaints of PIP fraud, made 316 arrests and received 204 convictions. Our ruling This is an interesting case study in politics. Let's start by stating the obvious. Rubio would have been better off selling his house to someone other than the mother of a chiropractor who was trying to get him to extend personal injury protection. It seems odd. But, other than perception, there are no obvious glaring red flags about the sale. He got a good price, it seems, but not an outrageous one based on the comparable sales we examined. Also, the cash sale doesn't bother us particularly. This is a retiree who had money from a life insurance policy. As for Rubio's position on the PIP laws, he initially said he would let the mandate expire unless fraud reforms were included. Some were included in the legislation proposed by the Senate, but apparently not enough to sway Rubio. So the session ended in May 2007 without action, despite the house sale. Rubio and House leaders then worked to include additional fraud protections and were able to reach a deal more to their liking. Rubio, in fact, called to include PIP legislation during a special session. The ultimate bill that passed included a few more anti-fraud measures, but seems not to have stopped much fraud, according to state statistics. We're not sure why it took five extra months to include the minor changes to the PIP legislation, or why House leaders didn't propose the changes during the session. Crist condensed the facts when he said that the chiropractor lobbying Rubio bought the house. It was the chiropractor's mother who made the purchase. He also condensed the timeline and slightly manipulated the chain of events when he said, "once he sold the home ... the speaker's position on the issue changed." We think there's at least a debate on whether he changed his position at all. Rubio never said he opposed extending PIP. He said he opposed extending it without proper protections against fraud. A version of the bill proposed during a 2007 special legislative session emerged that included fraud protections he wanted. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06900	"President Reagan did it (raised the debt ceiling) 18 times. George W. Bush did it seven times."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/26/barack-obama/obama-says-reagan-raised-debt-ceiling-18-times-geo/	In a televised address to the nation on July 25, 2011, to discuss the pending deadline on the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama made his pitch for a "balanced" approach to reducing the deficit -- one that includes spending cuts as well as revenue increases from tax increases for wealthier Americans. With the debt ceiling issue caught in a political deadlock over how to reduce the deficit, Obama noted that raising the debt ceiling has been a relatively routine exercise for decades. "Understand –- raising the debt ceiling does not allow Congress to spend more money," Obama said. "It simply gives our country the ability to pay the bills that Congress has already racked up. In the past, raising the debt ceiling was routine. Since the 1950s, Congress has always passed it, and every President has signed it. President Reagan did it 18 times. George W. Bush did it seven times. And we have to do it by next Tuesday, August 2nd, or else we won’t be able to pay all of our bills." Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Jersey last week looked at a similar claim, that every president has raised the debt ceiling. They found that was Mostly True. Only President Harry S. Truman did not. Here, we are looking at Obama's claim that, "President Reagan did it 18 times. George W. Bush did it seven times." We'll go straight to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which keeps tabs on when the debt ceiling has been raised. Among its historical tables is one labeled "Statutory Limits on Federal debt 1940 - Current" (Table 7.3) The table lists 106 increases to the federal debt limit since 1940. More specifically, it lists 18 increases to the debt ceiling between February 1981 and September 1987. In other words, there were 18 under President Ronald Reagan, as Obama said. And there were seven increases between January 2001 and January 2009 -- during George W. Bush's presidency. We should also note that it has been raised three times already under President Obama, on Feb. 17, 2009, Dec. 28, 2009 and Feb. 12, 2010. We would be remiss if we failed to note that Obama opposed one of those increases to the debt ceiling under George W. Bush and criticized Bush for a lack of leadership. "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills," Obama said before a March 16, 2006, vote on raising the debt limit. The Senate narrowly approved raising the limit along partisan lines, 52-48, with all Democrats opposed. In an April 15, 2011, interview, Obama said he regrets his position in 2006. "I think that it's important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president," Obama said. "When you're a senator, traditionally what's happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit -- for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we, we can't play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And I'm the first one to acknowledge it." We rated that position a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter. Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to take the difficult vote to raise the limit, while the other party was free to criticize. An analysis of the past 10 years of votes on the debt limit from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center shows the vote usually splits along partisan lines, with the president's party voting in support. Nonetheless, Obama is correct that raising the debt ceiling has been an issue repeatedly tackled by Republicans and Democrats alike. President Reagan raised the debt ceiling 18 times and George W. Bush did it seven times. We rate his claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-07-26T12:42:53	2011-07-25	['George_W._Bush', 'Ronald_Reagan']
pomt-03207	Miami-Dade County is the "No. 1 donor county in the state."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/aug/27/rene-garcia/rene-garcia-calls-miami-dade-number-one-donor-coun/	When politicians gathered in August for the Florida Cabinet meeting in Miami, Sen. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, had a message about how the state treats Miami-Dade County, which we could boil down to this: No fair! In his welcome to Gov. Rick Scott and the Cabinet, Garcia said that Miami-Dade is the "No. 1 donor county in the state." In government-speak, a "donor county" is a county that gives more revenues to the state than it receives. (Fussing about being a donor county is a common refrain we’ve heard about Miami-Dade -- as well as about Broward and Palm Beach.) Is Miami-Dade the chief Santa Claus of Florida, sending generous gifts to the state and only getting back stocking stuffers in return? Garcia points to sales taxes We asked Garcia for documentation to support his claim. A legislative aide sent us a chart showing sales taxes collected in 2012-13. Miami-Dade collected the highest amount of sales taxes -- $2.6 billion -- while Orange County was second with $2.2 billion. But county-by-county sales tax comparisons aren’t a perfect indicator of what residents in a county contribute, for a variety of reasons. For starters, in some counties -- including Miami-Dade and Orange -- a portion of those sales taxes are paid by tourists. Visit Florida estimates that in 2012 tourists generated 23 percent of the state's sales tax revenue, while the state’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research estimates the figure at 13-15 percent. "Every county is different and has special circumstances that affect sales tax collections," wrote Lily Oliveros, Garcia’s legislative aide, in an email. "Residents of some small counties do a lot of shopping in adjacent larger counties; that does not mean that those residents are not paying their fair share of taxes." We asked Garcia if he had additional data to support his claim and he told us "it has been very difficult to get an accurate accounting of money going out and coming back in to each county." There are two ways that a reader could have interpreted Garcia’s claim that Miami-Dade is the "No. 1 donor county in the state." It’s possible to interpret that to mean most tax revenues contributed, or to mean the imbalance between what the county gives and what it gets back. We sought some clarity from Garcia. "I was referring to size of our population," he said. "This will however be a great case study to look at next session." The problems with trying to rank counties Two key experts on Florida’s budget -- Amy Baker, the state’s chief economist and Kurt Wenner, an expert at Florida TaxWatch -- told us they have never reached a conclusion as to which counties give more in tax revenues than they get back from the state. Both cited several problems with attempting to create such a ranking. Some tax data isn’t available by county: for example corporate income taxes. And on the spending side, some state infrastructure projects benefit more than one county. "To apply the ‘donor’ label, you would have to know the complete dollar value of both sides of the equation, and that information isn’t readily available on a definitive basis," Baker said. Wenner pointed to another problematic example: a college in a county getting state money that benefits students from more than one county. "Counties aren’t their own little fiefdoms," Wenner said. "There are not walls around them. It’s hard to allocate spending and revenue to a particular county and do it well. There’s a lot of blurred lines." And despite the cries about being a donor county, Miami-Dade legislators have a good record of bringing home the bacon, or as Florida TaxWatch calls it, turkeys. The county had the largest number of projects that Florida TaxWatch labeled turkeys for the 2013 session. In 2008, the Miami Herald spent three months quantifying the amount that Miami-Dade and Broward counties sent in taxes and fees to the state and how much the counties get back. Reporter Gary Fineout (now with the Associated Press) examined sales-tax revenues, documentary taxes, gas taxes, health care assessments, intangible taxes, insurance and utility taxes, slot machine revenues, and lottery sales. Not all tax revenues were available for a breakdown by county -- for example the cigarette and utilities tax, so the Herald came up with an estimate. Then the Herald calculated spending on education, healthcare, transportation, criminal justice, salaries of public institutions and some general-fund expenditures. Some spending was omitted since it was difficult to assign a county -- for example, how do you account for a prison in northern Florida that houses many inmates from South Florida. The conclusion: In 2007, the two counties sent at least $7.15 billion to the state, while the state government spent about $6.69 billion on them. (The article didn’t rank all counties in the state.) Then House Speaker Marco Rubio, now Florida’s Republican U.S. senator, told the Herald at the time that it was simplistic to suggest that his county Miami-Dade was getting "run over by other parts of the state," because many parts of the budget are driven by formulas based on population. For example, Miami-Dade received about $2.4 billion for K-12 education in 2013-14 through the Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP), which includes state and local education funds. The school district is the largest in the state and not surprisingly received the highest total. Total reimbursements to Medicaid providers were higher in Miami-Dade County -- $3.5 billion -- than any other county in Florida in 2011-12. That money is a combination of state, federal and local dollars, said Shelisha Coleman, a spokeswoman for the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. Our ruling Garcia said that Miami-Dade County is the "No. 1 donor county in the state." Garcia points to Miami-Dade contributing the most in sales taxes to the state. This isn’t surprising, though, since it is the largest county and a big tourism market. But budget experts warned us that it is difficult to create a ledger with spending and revenues and assign all those dollars to particular counties. Also, some money received by the county is based on a population formula and some revenues sent to the state are from tourists, not resident taxpayers. So far, we have seen no proof that Miami-Dade earns that top donor label spot, nor can we name any other county. At PolitiFact we believe the burden of proof is on the person making the statement and Garcia hasn’t done that here. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Wannabe Entertainment published a story criticizing national media for not acknowledging that James isn’t paying for the bulk of the school’s costs. Its headline paints taxpayers as bearers of the burden for the school, which opened July 30. "LeBron’s ‘I Promise School’ To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year," it says. Wannabe Entertainment is correct that taxpayers will pay millions of dollars for the school. However, the framing of the article could mislead readers to believe taxpayers will pay millions of dollars on top of what they were paying before, which is not the case. The first few paragraphs of the story are lifted straight from an Aug. 5 Cleveland Plain Dealer story. After that, the Wannabe Entertainment story switches to a diatribe about Trump's tweeted critique of James and CNN's Don Lemon after an interview and the "entire anti-Trump universe" coming to the basketball star's defense. Its version does not go on, as the Plain Dealer did, to credit James's investment. The I Promise School is a first-through-eighth grade public school that is part of the Akron Public School District. Because it is a public school, the LeBron James Family Foundation will foot a portion of the cost, but not the entire bill. "This is a public school," Akron Public Schools spokesman Mark Williamson told PolitiFact. "Taxpayers support all of our schools including this one." Public schools are funded by the state, property taxes and federal funds. So by law, the LeBron James Family Foundation cannot fully fund the school if it wanted to. The foundation pays for the additional services at the school that the other schools in the district do not have, including GED classes and job placement for parents, guest speakers and a food pantry. Stephanie Rosa, a spokeswoman for the LeBron James Family Foundation, told PolitiFact the foundation hasn’t added up how much it contributed to the school. A $2 million rough estimate covered some building renovations, such as rewiring for technology and staff hires for the family center. But the amount of money spent up until the day the school opened has not been made public. Before the opening of James’s school, the I Promise program had been in Akron elementary schools for more than 10 years. There are 32 elementary schools and kids from all those schools were in the program but now in one location. "It’s not a new program, not new students, not even a new building," Williamson said. Point being, taxpayers were going to pay for the students whether or not James got involved. There are 46 schools in the Akron Public School District. Williamson said 35 of those schools have been rebuilt and during that time, the home of the current I Promise school served as the temporary school for those students who were displaced in that in-between time. "For about 15 years, this building housed every student from every school that has been rebuilt," Williamson said. Williamson said the 240 students enrolled at I Promise were already in the program but in their respective elementary schools. "All we’re doing is taking kids that we already support and putting them in a different location," he said. The cost of educating the students is consistent. So are the teachers’ salaries. The opening of this school puts all the students in the I Promise program under one roof from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., July through May. There are no additional costs because the district didn’t hire any new teachers or recruit new students. Our ruling A story on Wannabeent.com says, "Lebron’s ‘I Promise School’ To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year." The headline and subsequent story might leave people thinking James’ school will be a drag on taxpayer resources. But taxpayers are paying the same amount of money they’d pay whether or not James got involved. James’s foundation is funding enhancements meant to try to elevate students attending the school.

pomt-05341	Says the health care reform bill was paid for, in part, by taking money from students and the student loan system.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/may/14/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-student-loan-money-was-used-cover/	Americans have their reasons for liking or disliking health care reform and its mandate to purchase insurance. But Sen. Rob Portman mentioned one that was new to us during a conference call with reporters. He was actually talking about student loans, but in answer to a question from WSPD radio in Toledo, Portman said: "The truth is, by the way, you know part of the health care bill is paid for by the administration taking the difference of what (interest rate) they can borrow at, and what most students pay, and putting some of that money into the health care bill." He repeated that "we took from students and paid for a new entitlement program we can't afford." And he rephrased it by saying "the health care bill was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system." Portman’s comments, made April 28, were in support of a Republican proposal to extend low-interest student loan rates (3.4 percent) for another year. Republican lawmakers would do that by taking money out of the 2010 health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Specifically, the money would come from a fund in the health bill that covers prevention and public health. We’re not here to debate whether that’s good policy. But Portman, acknowledging Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander’s leadership role in the GOP proposal, suggested something fresh to our ears: the notion that Obamacare, as it is commonly called, used student loan money. PolitiFact Ohio decided to learn more. Students once were considered a poor lending risk. To prime the pump and expand educational opportunities, the federal government in 1965 decided to guarantee student loans against default. The government also guaranteed a certain interest rate to the banks, even if the rates students paid were lower. And the government paid additional fees to the banks for administration and collection of student loans. This wound up providing a lucrative revenue stream for the banks, while putting millions of Americans through college. But the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies, and some in Washington, especially Democrats, started looking at alternatives. What if the government cut out the middle man (the banks) and gave loans directly to students through their colleges’ financial aid offices? Those offices already helped process most loans anyway. By getting rid of the subsidies, the government could save billions and use the money for more financial aid for needy students, Democrats said. Various pilot programs were tried. Some universities, including Ohio State, said they liked dealing directly with the government. But plenty of others liked the special attention private lenders gave them, and the private lenders spent millions lobbying Congress to keep the subsidy system. This debate dragged on for years. Then in early 2010, Democrats found the opening they needed to permanently move away from subsidizing the lenders. It coincided with passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Senate generally needs 60 votes to overcome filibusters and objections to legislation. Democrats lacked that number. So they decided to employ a seldom-used tactic involving budgets and government spending, known as "reconciliation." Reconciliation only requires 51 votes. That’s how Senate Democrats were able to pass a combined student loan-health care bill, the Reconciliation Act of 2010, on March 25, 2010, with 56 votes. You might not have heard much about the student loan portion at the time, because health care, a monumental social initiative, consumed most of the oxygen in Washington. But the two were connected through the reconciliation bill, which is where we come back to Portman’s claim. Did one component, student loans, help pay for health care? The answer is not as simple as it sounds. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the government was going to save $58 billion from the student loan program, over a 10-year period, by eliminating the middle man. That would provide enough money to put an additional $36 billion into Pell grants and $3 billion more into several other programs, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Even after these investments, the government would have $19 billion left, the CBO said. So was this $19 billion going into Obamacare? That’s what Portman’s press secretary, Christine Mangi, initially suggested when we first asked about Portman’s statement. The problem with that assumption is that the CBO did not show it that way. It showed the $19 billion as savings, or a net reduction in the federal deficit. And several budget experts we spoke with said that’s exactly where the $19 billion was going. The CBO also showed $124 billion in additional savings from the health care portion of the reconciliation act, thanks to new revenue, taxes and projected savings on Medicare. Mangi was skeptical of this projection, as are other Republicans, saying the health care provisions are certain to cost much more than assumed in 2010, wiping out any savings. Where will the money come from then? It’ll come in part from the money the government got by changing its student-loan program, she said. She also noted that some private lenders used to provide interest-rate reductions for borrowers, and new borrowers won’t have that option. That’s speculation, however, and such private-bank incentives to students became fewer after the 2008 financial crisis. Still, we sought out budget and education officials on this, and then we called Alexander’s office. Alexander was secretary of education under President George H. W. Bush. His staff referred us to other CBO figures, but that just led to more dispute among budget experts over how to interpret the numbers. But then we found agreement -- from two key Senate offices on opposite sides of the aisle. Alexander’s office drew our attention to a statement made by Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, a leader on education issues. On March 23, 2010, on the Senate floor Harkin said that by ending the subsidies to banks, the government would have more money for Pell grants and historically black colleges. He also said that $10 billion would go for debt reduction. Notice that he said $10 billion? But wait -- wasn’t it supposed to be $19 billion, according to the CBO figures? So where did the other $9 billion go? It went to pay for a portion of health care reform, Alexander’s staff insisted. We turned to the staff of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which Harkin chairs. And at last, there was common ground. Harkin indeed said $10 billion would go for debt reduction. The other $9 billion, said committee spokeswoman Justine Sessions, went to help pay for expansion of community health centers, prescription drug access, and consumer protections in insurance. That’s $9 billion for health care out the student loan program. With that, we return to Portman’s claim -- that health care reform "was paid for in part by taking money out of the student loan system." Portman’s statement is partially accurate. The overall health care bill has hundreds of billions in features before revenue and tax offsets bring the costs down, if projections prove to be right. We’re not here to debate whether they will. Nine billion dollars is a tiny share. But Portman said "in part," and that $9 billion is destined for health care, so he’s right there. But he suggested this is at the expense of students. That’s a big leap, leaving out important detail and context. The combined student loan-health care bill did not reduce the amount of money that students can borrow. It actually expanded the amount of money available for student aid. What it reduced is the banks’ share. "The money that was saved wasn't money that was going into education -- it was money that was subsidizing private banks," Sessions, of the education committee, said in an email. "Period." On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman’s claim rates Half True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2012-05-14T06:00:00	2012-04-28	['None']
pomt-09839	Birthers have obtained a copy of Obama's Kenyan birth certificate.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/21/orly-taitz/alleged-obama-birth-certificate-kenya-hoax/	With all this health care debate dominating our time for the last few weeks, can we please get back to the issues that matter? Like, what's up with Obama's Kenyan birth certificate? Birthers, the folks who question whether Obama was born in Hawaii and is eligible to serve as president, experienced a bit of a second wind there for a little while in late July as cable TV and radio programs were abuzz over a group of Republican legislators who endorsed a bill that would require future presidential candidates to submit birth certificates to prove their citizenship. Then the health care debate began in earnest, and the birthers were again relegated to the backburner. Right before the media light dimmed on birthers, however, birther attorney Orly Taitz made a bit of a splash — at least in the birther community — when she posted a birth certificate purported to be for Obama from the Republic of Kenya and filed a motion in federal court to determine its authenticity. The conservative WorldNetDaily.com, which has long beaten the birther drum, quickly ran a story under the headline, "Is this really smoking gun of Obama's Kenyan birth?" But even WorldNetDaily founder Joseph Farah later ran a column saying he doubted it was real. Still, some PolitiFact readers asked about it, and so we decided to check it out. We e-mailed the purported Kenyan birth certificate to Salim Lone, spokesman for Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, to see what he thought. Here was his three-sentence reply: "It's a forgery. Kenya only became a Republic in December, 1964. Other arguments could also be marshaled, but they are not needed." Then came a crushing blow. An astute blogger, Steve Eddy of California, did a Google image search and came across an eerily similar-looking birth certificate posted on a genealogy Web site by a South Australia man named David Jeffrey Bomford. Eddy put it side-by-side with the Obama one. Same format. Same book and page number in the birth registry. Some of the officials' last names were even the same. "At that point, it was pretty obvious the Kenyan one was a fake, that someone had used this real one from Australia to make their version," Eddy told us. Eddy posted his finding on the Web, in a forum at Politijab.com . An ABC News affiliate in Australia got wind of it, tracked down David Jeffrey Bomford and broke the news to him about his newfound Web fame. "That is ridiculous," said Bomford, a 50-year-old public service clerk from Adelaide, Australia. "Little old person in Adelaide, the president of the United States. I don't know whether to laugh about it or not, be worried about it." Bomford said he certainly didn't have anything to do with it. "It's little old me and my mum and everything else up there," Bomford said. "Oh I definitely confirm that the birth certificate was mine. That was quite easy to see — my address, even the style of the birth certificate was an old South Australian one. So it's quite easy to identify that it's mine." And what of the Kenyan birth certificate? "It's definitely a copy of my certificate," Bomford said. "It's so laughable it's ridiculous." Orly Taitz wasn't backing off so quickly, though. On her Web site, she suggested the South Australia birth certificate was more likely the fake, altered from the Obama one from Kenya to discredit the birthers. Said Eddy: "There's no reasoning with some of these people." But just to be sure, we fired off an e-mail to South Australian officials to see if they could set things straight. We heard nothing. Until yesterday. (This is our sheepish explanation for why we are dropping a birther item into the middle of the health care debate.) We got an e-mail response from Val Edyvean, Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages for South Australia, in which she said this: "It appears that a South Australian loaded an image of his own birth certificate onto a family history website and that the format was used by others to 'create' a document which purported to be a Kenyan birth certificate for Barack Obama. As the South Australian man has now removed this image, and the date of his birth is in the period of certificates which are restricted from public access, I do not intend to add to speculation by commenting on details of either that certificate or any aspects of it." Ms. Edyvean also made it clear she didn't want any follow-up questions. "I now advise that I am not prepared to comment further nor otherwise to enter into further correspondence on this matter," she wrote. Fair enough. We think that's enough to definitively put this particular issue to rest. The purported Kenyan birth certificate posted by Taitz is a fake. As always, we have no delusions this changes anyone's mind in the birther movement. So please, spare us the vitriolic e-mails. At PolitiFact, we have explored several of the birthers' claims, and have concluded that there is ample evidence that President Obama was born in Hawaii. We simply post this item in case anyone came across the Kenyan birth certificate on the Internet and wondered what to make of it. Obama's Kenyan birth certificate? Pants on Fire.

pomt-15359	A photograph of 21-year-old Hillary Clinton featured a Confederate battle flag in the background.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/07/dinesh-dsouza/hillary-clinton-confederate-battle-flag-nope-old-i/	A photograph of Hillary Clinton with the Confederate flag? Could it be real? Conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza appears to have thought so. On Jully7, 2015, D’Souza -- the author of such conservative tomes as The Roots of Obama’s Rage and such films as 2016: Obama’s America -- tweeted an image of the young Hillary Rodham, then a recent Wellesley College grad, seated at home and wearing a rather headache-inducing pair of striped pants. Along with the image, D’Souza attached this message to his 198,000 Twitter followers: "Look closely at this Hillary photo; isn't that a Confederate flag behind her on the bookshelf?" There was one problem: The photograph had been doctored, though not by D’Souza. As PolitiFact was looking into this image on July 7, D’Souza had not tweeted a retraction or clarification. He also didn’t respond to an email sent through his website. About four hours after he sent the tweet, he stepped back from it: "CORRECTION: Disregard the photoshopped Confederate flag in the background of the Hillary photo and simply focus on those glasses and hairdo." The image came from a series of photographs that Life photographer Lee Balterman took of members of the Wellesley Class of 1969 for a multipage photo essay in the magazine. One image of Clinton from the series ran with the photo essay itself, and at least one other photograph trickled out afterward (it can be seen accompanying this 2007 New York Times article). The photographs were taken at her home in Park Ridge, Ill. It took until 2014 for the full series documenting Clinton -- then known as Hillary Rodham -- to see the light of day, when Life.com published extensive selections from the series here. The important point of all this background is that the images of Clinton taken by Life do not include a Confederate battle flag anywhere. That leaves the only possible option that someone, somewhere along the way, digitally manipulated the image to include the flag, whether through sinister motives or simply for a laugh. Soon after the image started circulating on the Internet -- which occurred as early as July 5 here -- skeptics noted previously posted photographs from that series that don’t show a Confederate battle flag. One contributor to the blog Little Green Footballs wrote, "5 seconds of Google image search showed that the flag was never in any of the previous images, particularly this one tagged by Getty Images at Huffington Post in 2012." The blogger added, "Admit it, you were all dazzled by the psychedelic pants!" Our ruling D’Souza tweeted out to nearly 200,000 followers a photograph of 21-year-old Hillary Clinton that appeared to feature a Confederate battle flag in the background. But as a look at the original images makes clear, the photograph has been manipulated to include the flag, and D’Souza’s accompanying comment in the tweet doesn’t indicate that he was aware of the fakery. (He later corrected the tweet.) We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Dinesh D'Souza	None	None	None	2015-07-07T15:43:32	2015-07-07	['Hillary_Rodham_Clinton', 'Confederate_States_of_America']
pomt-00179	"Surgeon who exposed Clinton Foundation corruption in Haiti found dead in apartment with stab wound to chest." — Intellihub	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/22/blog-posting/no-doctor-was-not-murdered-after-criticizing-clint/	After a New York City surgeon was found dead at his Park Avenue apartment in late 2017, some media drew a connection between his apparent suicide and a lawsuit brought against him by a former New York Giants running back. Police investigated the death of Dean Lorich as a suicide, news reports from the ABC News and the New York Daily News stated at the time. The medical examiner determined that Lorich’s death was a suicide, a fact that the New York Police Department confirmed for us again on Friday. But another website, Intellihub, published a Dec. 12, 2017 story suggesting something more nefarious—that Lorich was murdered after exposing corruption involving the Clinton Foundation in Haiti. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It appears to be making the social media rounds nearly a year after publication, with CrowdTangle data showing it has been shared on Facebook nearly 80,000 times, generating almost 373,000 social media interactions. "A well-known surgeon who exposed major inadequacies in medical trauma care promised to the Haitian people by the Clinton Foundation after the nonprofit raised over $30 million dollars in donations following the devastating 2010 earthquake was found dead in his upscale apartment Sunday with a stab wound to the chest," begins the Intellihub.com story written by Shepard Ambellas and labeled as an "opinion" piece. Intellihub’s website describes Ambellas as "an opinion journalist, analyst, and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News & Politics." Ambellas is also, according to the site, a regular contributor to Alex Jones’ InfoWars.com, a website known to traffic in fake news and conspiracy theories. Ambellas goes on in the story to report that Lorich was working with a team of doctors in Haiti when he "discovered an almost non-existent medical effort backed by the Clinton Foundation." When he was stateside again, the story says, Lorich aired his grievances in an email that was eventually forwarded to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A note at the end of the article asks readers who they think murdered the doctor. "Did the doctor’s persistence wind up getting him added to the Clinton body count?" the website says. "Please comment and share." According to Intellihub’s website, it is an "independent news outlet which covers a variety of topics such as politics, the economy, surveillance, liberal corporate media bias, and much more." Ambellas did not immediately respond to an email seeking more information about the article. An email sent to an address at the bottom of the Intellihub website also went unanswered. The story links to three outside sources. The first is a New York Post article about the surgeon’s death and the lawsuit he was facing. It doesn’t mention the Clintons or Haiti. The second is a WikiLeaks page that appears to show an email Lorich wrote in 2010 that was eventually forwarded to Hillary Clinton. By the time it reached the the-secretary of state, the subject line was: "DOCTORS REPORT FROM HAITI." "Depressing," wrote the aide who forwarded it. In the email, Lorich describes a trip to Haiti with other doctors to provide trauma care in the wake of a devastating earthquake there. When they arrived, they were discouraged to discover that "disaster management on the ground was nonexistent," according to the email. "The difficulties in getting in despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and David Helfet’s high political connections with Partner’s in Health as well as the Clintons only portended the difficulties we would have once we arrived." The email does not mention the Clintons nor the Clinton Foundation again. The third link is the CNN piece authored by Lorich and surgeons Soumitra Eachempati and David Helfet. "Doctors: Haiti medical situation shameful," the headline reads. They describe their plan to help safely amputate the limbs of injured earthquake victims with a 13-member team of surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses. "We thought our plan was a good one, but we soon learned we were incredibly naive," the CNN opinion piece says. "Disaster management in Haiti was nonexistent. The difficulties getting in—despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and Dr. Helfet’s connections with Partners in Health and Bill and Hillary Clinton—only hinted at the difficulties we would have once we arrived." Lorich and the surgeons wrote of numerous points of failure in the operation before finally taking aim at the United States, writing, "The lack of support for our operation by the United States is shocking and embarrassing and shows how woefully unprepared we are for the realities of disasters." There is no further elaboration of the involvement of the Clintons or the Clinton Foundation. As other fact-checkers have noted, the Clintons played a role in Haiti recovery efforts. Hillary Clinton led the U.S. government’s response to the disaster, Bill Clinton was the United Nations special envoy to Haiti and their foundation raised millions for relief projects. The couple faced allegations that their efforts didn’t accomplish enough and that some of the projects they backed benefited foreign investors and the wealthy more than poor Haitians. Lorich’s criticism was aimed at the United States, not the Clinton Foundation, but conspiracy theories that the Clintons kill their political enemies aren’t new. And Intellihub isn’t alone in promoting the idea that the doctor’s death was retribution. But while these stories lean on some factual information—Lorich traveled to Haiti and he was discovered with a chest wound—there is no evidence that suggests he was murdered by the Clinton family.

pomt-06083	"Oregon’s per capita income is 9 percent below the national average and getting worse. This is a state that’s actually getting poorer."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/06/matt-wingard/oregons-capita-income-nine-percent-below-national-/	Oregon Rep. Matt Wingard and other House Republicans have vowed to unveil a jobs package in time for the February legislative session, saying that Oregonians are growing poorer. "Oregon’s per capita income is 9 percent below the national average and getting worse. This is a state that’s actually getting poorer. My Republican colleagues and I are determined to change that trajectory," the Wilsonville Republican said in a news post at OregonCatalyst. PolitiFact Oregon hadn’t been keeping up with the latest in per capita personal income statistics so we wanted to know if the 9 percent figure was accurate. More important, we wanted to know if indeed the gap is getting worse and if we are getting poorer. First, what is "per capita personal income"? Don’t fear the phrase. It’s just a fancy term for what happens if you add all the personal income received by all Oregonians from all sources and divide by the number of residents. Next, is Wingard’s number correct? Pretty much yes. Per capita personal income in Oregon in 2009 totaled $38,833 -- 8.4 percent lower than the national average of $42,408, according to recent figures by the Oregon Employment Department. In 2010, Oregon totaled $40,475 per person -- 8.8 percent below the national average of $44,384. So the gap widened a teeny bit between 2009 and 2010. Two more questions then: Is the gap getting worse? And does that mean we are actually getting poorer? Apparently this is a hot topic, with economists and business advocates arguing over how much weight to give per capita personal income in judging the state’s economic health. John Tapogna of EcoNorthwest argues income is a significant measure because our state relies so heavily on personal income for public services. His studies for the Oregon Business Council and others find that the Portland-metro area lags behind other cities such as Seattle and Denver. "In the middle to late ‘90s we went from being a slight over-performer on income to a slight under-performer on income. Seattle, Minneapolis and Denver have persistently stayed as over-performers," he said. Chuck Sheketoff of the Oregon Center for Public Policy finds over-reliance on the statistic "misleading, and how we rank relative to the rest of the nation is misleading." The per capita personal income in Oregon has increased most years, he notes correctly. "If personal income is your measure, we’re doing better," he said. PolitiFact Oregon also found a report by the Oregon Employment Department called "Why Oregon Trails the Nation." It’s a detailed explanation of why our per capita personal income is lower than the national average, and more important, what that means. "The two main reasons for the growing gap are slower earnings growth for Oregon workers when compared with the nation and a state population that has grown much faster than the nation in recent years," the authors write in the summary. Simply put, Oregonians don’t make as much money as people in other states, and the growth in population further flattens per-person income. Our per capita personal income has increased, but not fast enough to keep up with the national average, and not fast enough as it relates to population growth. Does the gap mean that we are getting poorer? "By this one measure, Oregon is a lot poorer than it was in the late ‘70s as compared to the rest of the nation," said Nick Beleiciks, an economist with the Oregon Employment Department. And we’re poorer -- again, as compared with the rest of the nation -- than in 1996, when Oregon reached its high tech high and lagged the national average by 3 percent. But "over the last four years, 2007-10, we really haven’t changed much," Beleiciks said. Here’s the other thing: The Employment Department report states that adjusted for inflation Oregon's per capita personal income rose in the last decade and has risen consistently during most of the last 70 years. It went from around $25,000 in 1990 to $40,475 in 2010. So, as Sheketoff said, it’s hard to argue that the state is getting poorer when the per capita personal income has grown most years. We turned to Wingard to get his take. He stands by the sentiment of his quote, because, he said, there’s no reason why Washington should be doing so much better than Oregon. "The fact of the matter is we used to track very closely with Washington state and we’ve left that trajectory," he said. "I do feel this state is getting poorer … It might look favorable in the short term, but not in the long term." All right, that sheds more context on his statement. And he’s right that in the 1970s Oregon and Washington were on par with the national average, but Washington has always outperformed Oregon. We’re going to throw in two more nuggets from the Employment Department report. One, researchers found that even if Oregon attracted 10,000 jobs each paying an annual salary of $100,000, per capita personal income would rise only six-tenths of one percentage point. So even with a bumper crop of new jobs, we’d still look relatively "poor." Two, there are a handful of other states and D.C. that throw the national average out of whack. Wyoming, for example, is oil rich but not people rich so the per capita personal income is high. Removing those areas would reduce the gap by 3.8 percentage points. So what do we know? Wingard is correct that we lag the national average by around 9 percent. We are poorer than we were in the 1970s or even in 2000, relative to other states. But the fact remains that incomes have increased over time in Oregon, even adjusted for inflation. The lag itself does not mean that we are growing poorer. We rate the statement Half True -- he’s correct on the figure, but not correct on whether it means we are growing poorer. Return to OregonLive to comment.

pomt-04055	"Religious groups like Knights of Columbus have been forced to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities, against their beliefs."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/27/national-organization-marriage/national-organization-marriage-rhode-island-says-r/	As the Rhode Island House of Representatives moved toward a vote on legalizing same-sex marriage, an ad appeared in some local newspapers asserting that those who oppose same-sex marriage had been penalized in other states. The ad, headlined "The Big Lie," was purchased by the National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island, which opposes same-sex marriage. It made several claims, including this one: "Religious groups like Knights of Columbus have been forced to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities, against their beliefs." The ad included the names and phone numbers of local legislators and urged readers to ask them to oppose same-sex marriage legislation. We wondered what was behind NOM’s statement, because one of the key issues in Rhode Island’s debate over same-sex marriage is whether those who oppose it on religious grounds could face legal liability if it becomes law. We contacted the marriage group, whose regional coordinator, Christopher Plante, e-mailed us various incidents summarized in its blog and links to others. Only one involved the Knights of Columbus. And that was in Canada. Here’s what we found: In 2003, two Canadian women booked a Knights of Columbus Hall owned by the Archdiocese of Vancouver for their wedding reception. (Same-sex marriage has been legal in British Columbia since July 2003 and overall in Canada since July 2005.) After learning about the nature of the event, the Knights told the women they could not use the hall. They found another location but filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. We read the tribunal’s somewhat contradictory split decision, issued in 2005. On the one hand, it said it "accepts that the Knights are entitled to this constitutional protection and therefore cannot be compelled to act in a manner that is contrary to their core religious beliefs." But it also declared that the Knights’ conduct was discriminatory and ordered the group to pay $1,000 to each of the women "for injury to their dignity, feelings and self-respect" and "to refrain from committing the same or similar contravention" of anti-discrimination rules. But contrary to NOM’s advertisement, it did not force the Knights "to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities." NOM cited another instance in which the owner of an Annapolis, Md., trolley tour service, based on his religious beliefs, purportedly decided in 2012 to get out of the wedding tour business so he would not have to take on same-sex couples as clients. (Same-sex marriage became legal in Maryland in March 2012 and was affirmed by voters in November.) NOM cited a Patch Annapolis article as its source. But the example has little relevance to NOM’s claim. The tour bus company is not a religious organization and it was not forced to do anything. In a subsequent interview, Plante referred to another case involving Methodists in the New Jersey community of Ocean Grove. Here’s what we found: In 2007, Harriet Bernstein, 70, a retired school administrator, and Luisa Paster, 64, a retired academic librarian, decided to have a civil-union ceremony. (Like Rhode Island, New Jersey allows civil unions but not same-sex marriages.) The couple wanted their ceremony at a waterfront pavilion that was advertised for marriage and other public events and was owned by the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association, which describes itself as "God’s Square Mile at the Jersey Shore." The Methodist group refused to allow the couple to use the facility. Bernstein and Paster instead held their ceremony in June 2007 at a nearby fishing pier. The couple complained to the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights, which decided in October 2012 that, because the association received a tax exemption from the state’s Green Acres program, the pavilion had to be open to anyone in the future. Again, the example NOM cited didn’t support its claim because the Methodist group hadn’t been forced to hold a same-sex ceremony. (It’s conceivable, of course, that a same-sex couple might press the issue in the future.) We searched the Internet for any examples in which a religious group had been forced to host a same-sex ceremony against its beliefs. We couldn’t find any. Our ruling The National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island said in a newspaper advertisement that "religious groups like Knights of Columbus have been forced to allow same-sex marriage ceremonies in their facilities, against their beliefs." But the Knights of Columbus incident cited as proof by Plante, NOM’s regional coordinator, was from Canada and did not support its claim. Neither did the second example it cited. Nor the third. NOM made a strongly worded claim on the eve of a key vote that was meant to influence voters -- and their legislators. We can’t predict what could happen under same-sex marriage laws in the future. But we can rule on claims that are so far from the truth. The judges rule Pants on Fire.

pomt-09976	"Barack Obama's nominee for 'regulatory czar' has advocated a 'Fairness Doctrine' for the Internet" that would require links to opposing opinions.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/05/chain-email/cass-sunstein-once-considered-fairnes-doctrine-sor/	A PolitiFact reader sent us a chain e-mail that claims that President Barack Obama's nominee to be the administration's regulatory czar once advocated a "Fairness Doctrine" of sorts for the Internet, one that would require partisan sites to link to sites with opposing viewpoints. We're talking here about Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor, who was tapped to head up the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. First off, let's peel back the onion a bit on this chain e-mail. It originates from an article on the conservative news site World Net Daily about comments on Sunstein by Brad O'Leary, author of the book Shut Up, America! The End of Free Speech. Said O'Leary: "It's hard to imagine President Obama nominating a more dangerous candidate for regulatory czar than Cass Sunstein. Not only is Sunstein an animal-rights radical, but he also seems to have a serious problem with our First Amendment rights. Sunstein has advocated everything from regulating the content of personal e-mail communications, to forcing nonprofit groups to publish information on their Web sites that is counter to their beliefs and mission. Of course, none of this should be surprising from a man who has said that 'limitless individual choices, with respect to communications, is not necessarily in the interest of citizenship and self-government.' If it were up to Obama and Sunstein, everything we read online — right down to our personal e-mail communications — would have to be inspected and approved by the federal government." To explore whether the claim is true, we went back to Sunstein's 2002 book, Republic.com . In it, Sunstein discusses the drawbacks of limitless choices on the Internet that allow people to seek out only like-minded people and opinions that merely fortify their own views, creating an echo chamber that Sunstein argued is bad for democracy. In the book, Sunstein talks about the idea of the government requiring sites to link to opposing views. In a later edition of the book released in 2007, Republic.com 2.0 , Sunstein tempers that position, advocating instead for the creation of public spaces on the Internet where people with differing viewpoints could share their ideas with one another. But in a video interview on the Web site Bloggerheads.tv on Feb. 29, 2008, Sunstein actually goes a little bit farther than that, calling it a "bad idea" he should never have ventured. Asked to explain some of the differences between the first book, what Sunstein called "the initial inadequate edition," and its successor, Sunstein said, "To me, the most important (difference) is that the first Republic.com was full of some bad policy recommendations and I was able to get rid of those. So I feel the book has been corrected." "The initial book was interested in at least considering some government mandates that would require people to link to opposing views, that would require some attention to arguments that maybe had been neglected," Sunstein said. "And while the book Republic.com was pretty tentative about that, to be tentative about a bad idea, it's probably better not to even venture a bad idea. Some of the bad ideas I ventured tentatively as worth considering in Republic.com , in 2.0 I say they'd be bad ideas and they'd be unconstitutional." The World Net Daily story notes that Sunstein "rethought" the proposal as "too difficult to regulate" and "almost certainly unconstitutional," but that caveat is made later in the article and is overshadowed by the headline, which says "U.S. regulatory czar nominee wants Net 'Fairness Doctrine.'" Yes, Sunstein acknowledges this was an idea he once threw out there — albeit, in his words, "tentatively." But he now thinks it's a bad idea. So the chain e-mail/article is correct that Sunstein once suggested it. But contrary to the headline, it's a position he no longer holds, as he has since said strongly and repeatedly. Once true. No longer. That leaves us at Half True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2009-05-05T15:12:52	2009-04-27	['None']
pomt-01528	"Three of five detainees swapped (for Bowe Bergdahl) are now ISIS leaders."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/18/blog-posting/have-three-detainees-swapped-bowe-bergdahl-now-joi/	A reader recently sent us a link to a rather startling claim -- that three of the five Guantanamo detainees released by the United States in late May in exchange for Taliban prisoner Bowe Bergdahl have now taken up arms for the Islamic State. That’s the militant group sometimes known as ISIS or ISIL that has taken control of portions of Iraq and Syria and has beheaded two American journalists and at least one other Westerner. The claim stems from a website, politicalears.com, that ran a post on Sept. 15, 2014, with the headline, "Three of five detainees swapped are now ISIS leaders." The post, which was also linked to elsewhere on the Internet, goes on to say: "It is being reported that at least 3 of the 5 detainees involved in the swap have joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq as commanders and are using that rank to usher in an 'Islamic Caliphate' (a Sunni Islamic Theocracy -- contrary to Obama's claims that ISIS is not Islamic). "The 'Taliban 5' who were transferred from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to custody in Doha, Qatar, are Mohammad Fazl, Khairullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Norullah Noori, and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They have largely disappeared from view since they were dropped off in Doha, but eyewitnesses place Fazi, Wasiq, and Noori in Iraq and Syria fighting with ISIS." If true, this would be a major story. But it’s not. President Barack Obama took significant heat at the time for releasing the five detainees, with some critics also taking issue with the ex-detainees’ new terms of custody -- being transferred to the Persian Gulf state of Qatar with restrictions on their political behavior but relative freedom of movement within the country. We didn’t find any news reports about what the ex-detainees have been up to recently, but we quickly noticed a couple of red flags that made us suspicious of the email’s claims. For starters, the claim in politicalears.com is entirely unsourced. In addition, we’d run into politicalears.com before and found the site less than credible. Earlier this month, we looked at its claim that "over 73 percent of all donations raised" from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge "are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations." We gave it a Pants on Fire. Experts who study the region told us the claim was wrong. The ex-detainees "are all in Qatar. This is nonsense," said Barnett R. Rubin, director and senior fellow at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that while he doesn’t doubt that the ex-detainees are dangerous to United States interests, "there is literally zero evidence" that the detainees have been spotted on the battlefield with ISIS. Gartenstein-Ross added that the claim doesn’t even make much logical sense and betrays the author’s weak grasp on the region’s nuances. "The ex-detainees "were in the Afghanistan-Pakistan theater," Gartenstein-Ross said. "Based on these guys’ social networks and who their points of contact were, it’s pretty unlikely they’d be able to quickly find a way to the battlefield and have a command" in the Iraq-Syria border region. "They are not native Arabic speakers, and it would be unfamiliar terrain culturally. They would face a lot of obstacles," he said. When we asked the White House if there was any evidence that one or more detainees has joined ISIS, spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said, "There is no truth to these reports." Our ruling Bloggers said that "three of five detainees swapped (for Bowe Bergdahl) are now ISIS leaders." The claim has nonexistent sourcing, has been published by sites with questionable track records for accuracy, and has been knocked down by independent experts. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-03085	Says Ken Cuccinelli tried to make it more difficult for mothers to obtain divorces.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2013/sep/26/terry-mcauliffe/terry-mcauliffe-says-ken-cuccinelli-tried-make-it-/	Editors Note: On Sept. 16, PolitiFact Virginia rated as Mostly False a statement by Terry McAuliffe’s campaign that Ken Cuccinelli wants to make it more difficult for mothers to get divorces. After reconsidering the evidence available, we’ve decided to change the rating to Half True, which means the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of conext. Terry McAuliffe, Democratic Party gubernatorial candidate, turned to divorce law this month in his ongoing effort to portray Republican Ken Cuccinelli as insensitive to women. Here’s the text of a TV ad McAuliffe launched on Sept. 4 that contains a picture of a woman pushing two young children on swings: "2008. Ken Cuccinelli writes a bill to give Virginia among the most extreme divorce laws in America. If Cuccinelli had it his way, a mom trying to get out of a bad marriage, over her husband’s objections, could only get divorced if she could prove adultery or physical abuse or her spouse had abandoned her or was sentenced to jail. Why is Ken Cuccinelli interfering in our private lives? He’s focused on his own agenda. Not us." The ad follows a series of McAuliffe claims that Cuccinelli has sought to limit access to abortion and birth control. We wondered whether Cuccinelli really did introduce legislation aimed at making it harder for moms to end bad marriages. Let’s start with a quick primer on Virginia’s divorce laws. The grounds for ending a marriage include adultery, felony conviction, cruelty or fear of bodily harm, wilful desertion and voluntary separation of 12 months when there are minor children or six months when there are no minor children and a property agreement exists. Even when other grounds exist, couples often use the separation rule so they can obtain a so-called "no-fault" divorce, according to Edward Barnes, president of Barnes & Diehl, a family law firm. He said the process ends up being a little less expensive and neither party is blamed for the divorce in a final decree, which is among the paperwork available as public records. And if there’s been adultery or other grounds for ending a marriage, the no-fault grounds can be used as a bargaining chip in divorce proceedings by the innocent party. "I think a lot of lawyers will think in terms of benefit to the children," Barnes said. "There will not be an adultery decree that could be waved around later to hurt the children." All states have unilateral no-fault divorce grounds, although they vary greatly in the separation time frame required. Cuccinelli, as a state senator in 2008, introduced legislation that would have eliminated the ability for a spouse in a couple with minor children to unilaterally file for divorce under the separation ground. The bill would have allowed the other spouse to block the process by filing a written objection. The legislation died in the Senate Courts of Justice Committee. Cuccinelli explained his support for tougher divorce laws in 2007 and 2009 campaign statements. "Studies show that the dissolution of marriage has long term negative impacts on children and those marriages that last for five years are much more likely to go the distance," he wrote. "For this reason, the state has an interest in marital preservation. I support family law reform that establishes mutual consent divorce and requires counseling where children are involved, unless abuse is involved." McAuliffe’s TV ad suggests Cuccinelli’s 2008 bill would have weakened the options of moms seeking divorce and strengthened the hand of dads. McAuliffe’s campaign backed that message sending us links of columns from a conservative father’s rights groups supporting tightening divorce rules and from the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Organization for Women defending the no-fault divorce rules in that state. Neither article addressed Virginia law, Cuccinelli’s bill, or laid out specific arguments that no-fault divorce is more advantageous to mothers than fathers. The father’s group contended that children are best-served by being raised in a household with both of their parents; NOW said it is traumatic for children to remain in homes with dysfunctional marriages. Barnes, while no fan of Cuccinelli’s bill, said it’s misleading for McAuliffe to portray it as aimed against mothers. "It’s gender neutral. Neither side can remarry. Both sides, if they’re living apart, can’t files tax returns as a couple and that costs them." Our ruling McAuliffe’s ad says Cuccinelli introduced legislation in 2008 that would have made it more difficult for mothers to obtain divorces. Cuccinelli’s unsuccessful bill would have eliminated the ability for a spouse in a couple with minor children to unilaterally file for a no-fault divorce. The legislation would have allowed the other spouse to block the process by filing a written objection. In portraying the bill as an attack on women, McAuliffe ignores that the legislation would have made it equally more difficult for dads to get divorces. So McAuliffe’s statement has accuracy, but leaves out an important detail and context. We rate it Half True.	None	Terry McAuliffe	None	None	None	2013-09-26T15:30:27	2013-09-04	['Ken_Cuccinelli']
pomt-09429	"Bill White ... supports the ‘ObamaCare’ socialized medicine plan, as well as ‘Cap and Trade’ legislation that would kill thousands of Texas jobs."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/mar/14/cathie-adams/cathie-adams-who-chairs-texas-gop-says-bill-white-/	We conclude our trifecta of Truth-O-Meter rulings on a February fund-raising letter sent by Texas GOP chair Cathie Adams. She levelled six charges against Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White including these pops: "He supports the ‘ObamaCare’ socialized medicine plan, as well as ‘Cap and Trade’ legislation that would kill thousands of Texas jobs." Socialist? Job-killer? We decided to test the politically potent charges. (We deal with the rest of Adams' letter in separate Truth-O-Meter items.) On Adams’ claim that White supports the "‘ObamaCare’ socialized medicine plan," the Republican Party initially referred us to an August article in the El Paso Times. The story makes no reference to "Obamacare" or "socialized medicine." Instead it quotes White saying he backs President Barack Obama’s goals of allowing people to keep their current doctors and insurance plans and expanding the availability of health coverage while containing costs. The article also quotes White referring to his support for employers, employees and public-private partnerships to enable affordable basic health care. His campaign says White was among advocates who persuaded state lawmakers to permit "3-share" partnerships. White also has called for expanding the enrollment of children in Medicaid, which serves the poor, and the federally supported Children's Health Insurance Program, which serves the working poor. Surprisingly, considering White was a Senate candidate through much of last year, White's campaign says he has not voiced support for any particular health-care plan before Congress. For Adams’ statement about White supporting a cap-and-trade approach to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the party pointed us to an article published in December's Texas Monthly magazine. Cap-and-trade plans typically try to ratchet down air pollution by making a set number of pollution allowances available. Companies can then trade or sell the allowances if their facilities pollute less than they're allowed. The article doesn't reveal White’s position on the cap-and-trade idea. Rather, it quotes a press release from a Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman speculating about something White's campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, told the Austin American-Statesman in September: That White had advised Obama on energy topics. The GOP spokesman said: "President Obama has proposed massive tax hikes on Texas energy companies and a cap-and-trade scheme that would raise energy prices on Texas families. Is this the result of the ‘advice’ Mayor White’s spokesperson referred to today? Texas voters deserve to know exactly which aspects of President Obama’s energy scheme White supports." Earlier, White told the American-Statesman he didn't consider the cap-and-trade plan narrowly approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in June "an effective piece of legislation for accomplishing its goals at a reasonable consumer cost... I’ve shared some of those thoughts with senators, of how we could have an energy policy that’s sustainable and also affordable." Last week, White said he's never endorsed a cap-and-trade proposal, preferring approaches that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by encouraging utilities to use more natural gas and renewable energy. "The closer somebody comes to that approach, the more I support it," White said. White also has called for Texas to follow states including California, New York and Massachusetts in adopting state-level low-emission vehicle standards so that "we help drive down the cost of more fuel-efficient, lower-emission vehicles for all people in our country. Texas is the biggest state not to have adopted these standards. And I think the auto makers will see the writing on the wall if we do so." Any politico can appreciate why Republicans want to portray White as favoring "socialized medicine" and cap-and-trade legislation critics say would slam the state's economy. But in the absence of confirming facts, these sizzlers read like ridiculous smears. We rate Adams' statement Pants on Fire.	None	Cathie Adams	None	None	None	2010-03-14T05:48:47	2010-02-20	['Texas']
pomt-01428	Says Thom Tillis "has cut $500 million from public education."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/07/kay-hagan/debate-kay-hagan-says-thom-tillis-cut-education-50/	Education spending was a point of contention in the North Carolina Senate debate on October 7, when Sen. Kay Hagan repeated a popular Democratic talking point that Thom Tillis and state House Republicans are responsible for cuts to school funding. Sen. Hagan said Tillis "has cut $500 million from public education and, you know what that means folks? That means fewer teachers in the classroom. That means larger classroom sizes and that means outdated textbooks if there’s any textbooks at all." Back in June we checked the same claim from a television ad sponsored by Women Vote, an arm of EMILY's List, a political action committee that supports Democratic women who are in favor of abortion rights. Where did the cuts come from? When we looked at North Carolina's education budget year to year, it has increased every year since Tillis became speaker in 2011. According to a document prepared by the General Assembly, the state education budget was $10.8 billion in the 2010-11 fiscal year and $11.5 billion for 2014-15. (These numbers are adjusted for inflation and include both K-12 and higher education spending.) Additionally, state expenditure per pupil for K-12 has increased since 2011 -- from $5,156 in 2011 to $5,395 in 2013. Education spending in North Carolina comes from a combination of federal, state and local dollars. State funding accounts for more than 62 percent of expenditures. So did Sen. Hagan and Women Vote pull that $500 million cut out of thin air? No, but it's complicated. Each year, the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management creates a continuation budget, which is a tool that outlines how much should be spent to maintain the current service level, without cutting or adding services. The projection might be larger or smaller than previous years because it takes into account factors such as inflation, population growth and operating new facilities. Lawmakers are not obliged to match the continuation budget. For the 2013-15 budget, the state budget office proposed a continuation budget of about $23.6 billion for those two years to maintain the status quo across K-12 and higher education. The budget that state lawmakers passed came up to about $23.1 billion. In total, lawmakers allocated $481 million less than the the continuation budget suggested. (EMILY's List pointed us to this when we asked about the ad back in June.) That shortfall ended up dividing the political parties in North Carolina: Last year, Tillis took to the floor to push lawmakers to pass the budget, while Democrats bashed the bill primarily because they believed the education allocations weren't adequate. The bill passed 65-53 in the House and 32-17 in the Senate, with no Democratic votes in favor. It’s important to note that the Legislature’s choosing to fund at levels lower than the continuation budget is not a literal budget cut. In raw dollars, the state is spending more money than in previous years. However, Tillis’ critics say it has the same effect as a cut. "If you’re not doing what it takes to maintain the status quo, it’s a cut," said Hagan spokeswoman Sadie Weiner. Some other critics of Tillis’ education record have noted that state funding for K-12 education in North Carolina is about $500 million less than pre-recession levels. In the 2013-14 school year, public school spending was about $7.9 billion. In 2008-2009, it was $8.4, when adjusted for inflation. The budget affecting the 2014-15 school year eliminated 5,200 teachers, 3,800 teacher assistants and about $115 million for textbooks and instructional supplies, among other services, Philip Price, CFO for the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, told us in June. It also increases student-teacher ratios. The budget added a small number of new programs, but the vast majority of state education spending growth over the years comes down to rising healthcare and retirement costs. "That doesn’t help the students," Price said. "It doesn’t mean you get more teachers. It doesn’t change what is available to that classroom." Reductions in federal and local education spending -- as well as funding shifts due to rising charter school popularity -- could also be a major reason why schools feel as if their funds have shrunk, despite a steadily increasing state budget, said Terry Stoops, director of research and education policy at the John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina think tank that promotes limited government. He added that between 2010 and 2013, federal funding to North Carolina schools dropped by $337.6 million. But when the federal government stopped giving North Carolina schools stimulus funding, the state did not pick up the slack, Price said. The state's shrinking spending on classroom services is part of a trend that has been going on since the recession -- back to when Democrats controlled the General Assembly -- and can't be solely blamed on one speaker of the house, he added. Our ruling Sen. Hagan’s statement attacking Tillis said he "has cut $500 million from public education." Literally, the statement is wrong. As North Carolina's Speaker of the House, Tillis helped pass a budget in 2013 that increased actual spending on education in comparison to previous years. But the budget spent almost $500 million less than what was requested to maintain the status quo, accounting for inflation and increased costs of various services. Additionally, the actual budget increase had a lot to do with rising costs of employee benefits, and not a lot to do with money that ends up in the classroom. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11640	"The graduation rate in New York City has increased by 50 percent in 13 years"	true	/new-york/statements/2018/jan/17/bill-de-blasio/how-much-has-graduation-rate-increased-nyc-start-m/	Schools in New York City have one feature the rest of the state’s schools do not: They’re under the exclusive control of the mayor. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed graduation rates have soared since that power was granted. "Since mayoral control of education came in, the graduation rate in New York City has increased by 50 percent in 13 years," de Blasio said at a news conference in Albany. The New York State Legislature gave then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg control over the city’s schools in 2002. Only about half of students graduated before 2002. The change allowed Bloomberg to appoint a manager of the school system to replace the Board of Education. The legislature has since renewed mayoral control four times, with a sunset scheduled for 2019 unless lawmakers extend control again. De Blasio has been unable to convince Republicans in the State Senate to give permanent control to the city’s mayor. Is de Blasio right that the graduation rate has increased by 50 percent since then? Graduation rates About 17,000 more students graduated from New York City schools in 2016 than 2005, according to the New York City Department of Education. The graduation rate was 46.5 percent in 2005. The state changed the way the graduation rate is calculated that year, so numbers prior to 2005 are not comparable. The graduation rate increased each year until 2011, when the rate dropped from 61 percent to 60.9 percent. The rate also decreased in 2012, but has increased each year since. The most recent data shows the graduation rate for New York City schools at 69.6 percent in 2016. The rate for 2017 had not been released. The 2016 rate is about 23 percentage points higher than the rate for 2005, a 50 percent increase between the two years. The numbers count students who graduate in June of their fourth year of high school. The state also began tracking the graduation rate for students who graduate in August after their fourth year of high school in 2008. The graduation rate was 72.6 percent in 2016 when the August graduates are counted. The same success has not been felt in every district. District 8 in the Bronx still had a June graduation rate of 50 percent in 2016, up slightly from 44.6 percent in 2005. Our ruling De Blasio said "the graduation rate in New York City has increased by 50 percent in 13 years." The increase between 2005 and 2016 is about 50 percent. We rate de Blasio’s claim True.

pomt-04815	"Paul Ryan got his start in politics, as a young staffer just out of college, working for then-Congressman John Kasich’s Budget Committee."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/17/chris-redfern/ohio-democratic-party-chairman-chris-redfern-says-/	The rush to define Paul Ryan is on. After Mitt Romney introduced the Wisconsin congressman as his vice presidential running mate Aug. 11, influential Republicans across the country praised the conservative House budget chairman in stream of prepared statements forwarded by the Romney campaign. Ryan’s selection similarly energized President Barack Obama and his supporters. Among the deluge of spin was a quote from Chris Redfern, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. "Paul Ryan got his start in politics, as a young staffer just out of college, working for then-Congressman John Kasich’s Budget Committee," Redfern said via email. Today Kasich is Ohio’s Republican governor and a lightning rod for Democrats and others who strenuously objected to the collective-bargaining restrictions he signed into law last year. Voters overturned the measure, known as Senate Bill 5, on a November ballot referendum. Kasich’s job approval rating, once stuck in the 30s and low 40s, has climbed recently but remains below 50 percent, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. No surprise, then, that Democrats working to carry Ohio for Obama have sought to tie him to Ryan. But is the tie as strong as Redfern implied? PolitiFact Ohio was curious. Ryan graduated in 1992 from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. It was there, according to several recent profiles, including an excellent one by the New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza, that he met William Hart, an economics professor who recommended him for an internship with U.S. Sen. Bob Kasten, a Wisconsin Republican. Ryan stuck around until Kasten lost his re-election in 1992. This was Ryan’s first job in politics -- or how he got his start, so to speak. After Kasten’s loss, Ryan found work with Jack Kemp, the former congressman, conservative icon and Republican nominee for vice president in 1996. Ryan has described the late Kemp as a mentor, though Redfern in his Aug. 11 statement said Ryan, who chairs the House Budget Committee that Kasich once led, has "followed in the footsteps of his mentor," meaning Kasich. Kasich did not become chairman of the panel until 1995, after Republicans led by Newt Gingrich and his Contract with America took control of the House. That was the year Ryan went to work for then-U.S. Rep. Sam Brownback of Kansas. Brownback had a seat on Kasich’s committee, and Ryan served as Brownback’s staff representative, said Rob Nichols, Kasich’s spokesman. Ryan drew a paycheck from the committee, Nichols said. But he reported to Brownback. Here’s how Washingtonian magazine, which listed him among its "Young Guns" in November 1996, described the early Capitol Hill days of Ryan, then a rising congressional staffer: "Congress is not foreign territory to Ryan — he worked in the upper chamber briefly for Wisconsin Senator Bob Kasten until Kasten lost his reelection bid -- but the Wisconsin native says he is happier with the pace of the House. Like many other influential policy aides, Ryan spent his time after Kasten’s defeat in exile at a couple of conservative think tanks -- first at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, then as a policy analyst for Jack Kemp at Empower America. He has continued to focus on financial concerns for Brownback, a member of the Budget Committee." We checked in with the Romney-Ryan team to verify the widely reported accounts of Ryan’s biography. Campaign aide Darrel Ng confirmed that Ryan’s first job in politics was with Kasten. Ryan did not work with Kasich until going to work for Brownback in 1995. PolitiFact Ohio informed the Ohio Democratic Party that the link between Ryan and Kasich was not as strong as Redfern made it seem. Jerid Kurtz, the party’s communications director, responded via email that "just out of college would cover three years after receiving a diploma." Kurtz added: "The point is, this was one of the first professional political jobs Paul Ryan had following college. Additionally, many staffers on the Budget Committee are placed on the committee at the discretion of a member on the committee -- but the chairman is in charge of the payroll and has authority over the committee and its staff." For PolitiFact, words matter. Redfern never said that working for Kasich’s Budget Committee was "one of the first professional jobs Paul Ryan had." Redfern was far more direct, saying that Ryan "got his start in politics" by working for Kasich "just out of college." The underlying point Redfern makes -- that Kasich and Ryan have close ties -- is fair. Kasich has spoken warmly of Ryan. In a Facebook posting last year, Kasich noted Ryan’s work for him on the Budget Committee, adding, "I always knew he was special." And Kasich’s campaign issued its own statement shortly after Romney announced Ryan as his running mate. In the email, Kasich boasts of his "great relationship" with Ryan and applauded his "understanding of how the Washington budget mess is holding back job creation." No doubt Ryan’s work on the Budget Committee helped shape and inform his views on his path to congressman, to committee chairman to Republican vice presidential running mate. Ryan said as much Wednesday when campaigning at his alma mater, Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Kasich was on hand to help introduce the vice presidential hopeful, and after taking the microphone Ryan referred to himself as Kasich’s "protege on the Budget Committee." Jackie Borchardt, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News who was at the event, tweeted the comment, as did Carl Weiser, the government and public affairs editor for the Cincinnati Enquirer. Weiser, who watched the speech from his desk via live feed, was kind enough to take another look at his newspaper’s raw video and confirm Ryan’s quote to PolitiFact Ohio. But John Kasich does not deserve credit for giving Ryan his start. Bob Kasten does. Redfern’s statement walks the line between imprecise language and careless exaggeration. The state Democratic Party leader is correct in suggesting that Kasich helped further Ryan’s career, but he paints a misleading picture by calling the Budget Committee job Ryan’s first after college. On the Truth-O-Meter there’s a rating for statements that are partially accurate but leave out important details. That rating: Half True.

pomt-08313	Says "Richard Devlin raised your taxes by $1 billion in a single day."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/30/taxpayer-association-oregon/anti-tax-group-claims-richard-devlin-raised-taxes-/	The claim by the Taxpayer Association of Oregon PAC is that state Senate Majority Leader Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, implemented $1 billion in new taxes in one day. The mailer goes even further to drive the point home to voters: The $1 billion comes down to more than $41 million an hour, or nearly $700,000 a minute, or $11,574 each second, and the question asked on the other side of the mailer is, "Can we afford four more years of Richard Devlin?" It certainly sounds like we can’t. But, as always, context matters, and PolitiFact Oregon set about to uncover the meaning behind the mailer. First up, a call to Jason Williams, co-founder of the PAC that paid for the mailers, which have also targeted other Senate Democrats in swing districts. He cited three bills, which legislative records show were passed on one day: June 11, 2009. The Oregon House had approved and sent to the Senate separate bills that (1) would raise personal income tax rates on wealthier households, (2) would raise taxes on corporations, and (3) would raise taxes on hospitals and insurers to provide health care for needy kids and adults. All told, the bills added up to $1 billion in the 2009-11 budget period. So that’s true. But let’s take a closer look at those bills. House Bill 2649 created two new tax brackets, including a 10.8 percent bracket for joint filers with income above $250,000 and for single filers with income above $125,000. For tax years after 2011, the rate is scheduled to drop to 9.9 percent. The bill also phased out some federal tax deductions. The Legislative Revenue Office estimated it would raise taxes for 2.5 percent of full-year individual filers (38,000) and 6.1 percent of returns (25,600) that report business income or loss. The proposal was projected to raise $472 million in 2009-11; it became Measure 66 in the January 2010 special election. House Bill 3405 raised the corporate minimum tax from $10 -- first set in 1931 and untouched until 2009 -- to a sliding scale of $150 to $100,000 depending on sales in Oregon. The $10 minimum for S-corporations went from $10 to $150. The bill also created a second tax rate of 7.9 percent and implemented filing fees. The Legislative Revenue Office estimated this would affect more than 75 percent of C-corporations and nearly all 62,000 S-corporations. The proposal was projected to raise $261 million in 2009-11; it became Measure 67 in the January 2010 special election. That gets us to $733 million, by targeting upper-income households and corporations. Both bills were approved to help close an estimated $4 billion state budget gap. All 18 Democrats in the Senate voted for both bills; no Republicans did. Anti-tax activists collected enough signatures to put the issue to voters, who agreed to keep the tax increases. These are not taxes that would hit the pocketbooks of the average Joe, but PolitiFact Oregon accepts that such taxes could affect employees and consumer prices. Now, for House Bill 2116, which wasn’t designed to balance the state budget but to expand health care coverage in Oregon. This proposal did two things. One, it levied a 1 percent tax on insurers, projected to raise more than $115 million in 2009-11 to insure 80,000 children. Two, it replaced an expiring tax paid by hospitals, and was projected to raise $300 million for low-income adults without health care. Hospitals, the entities paying the tax, actually backed the legislation because it would allow them to recoup more money from Medicaid. Two Republicans joined all 18 Democrats in the Senate to approve this bill. Again, we’re not sure how much the hospital tax -- not the insurer tax -- affects regular people in Oregon. So we called Williams back to get his take on the impact of the three bills. He was flabbergasted that we would even ask. Everyone pays, he said, when businesses fail or workers are laid off or prices go up. "It’s a billion dollars of taxes," he said. PolitiFact Oregon understands that a little bit of hyperbole is allowed in campaigns, although the per-second breakdown makes it sound as if Devlin is continuing to tax people at an unbelievable clip. The statement also ignores the fact that when measures 66 and 67 were put to Oregon voters they passed by wide margins. On the one hand, the statement is accurate -- taxes did go up by $1 billion. And Devlin as majority leader had considerable influence even though the statement makes it sounds as if he did it alone. But the statement leaves out important details, such as why the need, over how long and who agreed to them. We rate this Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-01030	"College tuition rates in Texas jumped by 55% since 2003."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jan/28/democratic-national-committee/national-democrats-criticizing-rick-perry-says-tex/	Democrats criticized Rick Perry for college costs the day the Republican governor gave his valedictory speech to Texas lawmakers. Among the beefs in a Jan. 15, 2015, email blast from the Democratic National Committee: "College tuition rates in Texas jumped by 55% since 2003, putting the dream of earning a college degree further out of reach for many Texans." That year should ring a bell; it’s when Perry and the Republican-controlled Legislature agreed to deregulate public college tuition, handing control to appointed college and university governing boards. Committee's source We wondered how much tuition ultimately escalated. By email, Miryam Lipper, a committee spokeswoman, pointed out a September 2012 news story in the Dallas Morning News that said by the paper’s analysis, "Texas students are paying 55 percent more for tuition and fees at state universities a decade after lawmakers lifted restrictions on costs." The story also said: "State officials used to brag about the affordability of college, but the costs have ballooned since 2003, even when inflation is factored in." Updated data Seeking up-to-date information, we reached out to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, where a staff spokeswoman, Kelly Carper Polden, pointed out a February 2014 board document she described as the most recent publicly available report on Texas tuition and fees. The document said, in part: "From fall 2003 through fall 2013, the statewide average total academic charges for a student taking 15 SCHs at a public university has increased by 104 percent." An SCH is a semester credit-hour. According to the document, the board’s calculations were rooted in tuition and fees charged students. Then again, the board said, a "student's actual charges may vary based on the student's classification and level of enrollment, the college the student attends within the university, the student's specific personal circumstances, or for other reasons deemed appropriate by the institution." Charts in the board analysis indicate the tuition and fees each year from fall 2003 through fall 2013 for nearly 40 institutions, most of them in the University of Texas or Texas A&M University systems. On average in fall 2003, tuition and fees were $1,934 for 15 semester credit-hours, according to the report. The average in fall 2013 was $3,951, the board said. By phone, Polden confirmed the board’s results didn’t take inflation into account. So we employed a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator to estimate that tuition and fees at the state’s public colleges and universities escalated 61 percent, in real terms, from fall 2003 through fall 2013. But that didn’t bring us to the 2014-15 school year. So we asked for comparable charges on average for a student as of fall 2014. By email, Polden said the fall 2014 statewide average for someone taking 15 SCHs was $4,091, lifting the raw average tuition increase since fall 2003 to 112 percent. Adjusted for inflation, we calculated, the increase was 64 percent. UT Austin Separately, we asked the University of Texas at Austin for its fall 2014 charge for that many credit hours. Spokesman Gary Susswein emailed the amount, $4,905, which we compared with the fall 2003 charge for that university of $2,721. Adjusted for inflation, the hike over the years came out to 40 percent. Out of governor's control? Worth mention: After signing tuition deregulation into law, Perry subsequently had no sway over tuition hikes except to appoint higher education governing boards. In recent years too, Perry called for $10,000, four-year degree programs and for institutions to freeze tuition so an entering student would pay the same tab each year while earning a degree. Our ruling The Democratic group, zeroing in on Perry, said Texas college tuition rates increased 55 percent since 2003. That figure is outdated--the increase through fall 2014 was 64 percent--and it's also worth clarifying the governor didn't directly control tuition, though he approved of the 2003 law deregulating rates and appointed ruling public college and university governing boards.

pomt-05197	Says "only 18 percent of Portland elementary schools have art instruction compared to 83 percent nationally."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/11/sam-adams/do-only-18-percent-portland-elementary-schools-off/	Portland Mayor Sam Adams loves Twitter. And we love that he loves Twitter, not least of all because it leads to an interesting PolitiFact Oregon item now and again. Last week, Adams took to the social networking service to bemoan the decline of arts education in city schools. "Clarification: Only 18% of Portland ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS have art instruction compared to 83% nationally." (He initially tweeted the same statistic but failed to note that it applied only to elementary schools.) He offered a link to the website of the Creative Advocacy Network, a group that is pushing for a strong arts curriculum. (His spokeswoman Caryn Brooks confirmed this was the source of the Tweet as well.) We spoke with Executive Director Jessica Jarratt Miller, who said the national number came from a study done by the U.S. Department of Education. That study looked at the percent of public elementary schools that have instruction designed for various arts subjects. According to that study -- which found its numbers through a representative survey process -- about 94 percent of elementary schools have music education and 83 percent have visual arts education. The Portland-specific numbers came from CAN’s own research. Jarratt Miller said those numbers reflect the percentage of Portland-area schools that reported employing an art teacher in a specific field even if it was only part time. According to their figures, 58 percent of Portland-area schools employ a music teacher and 18 percent employ a visual arts teacher. Now, we had no reason to doubt CAN’s figures. We’d PolitiFacted the group before when it said 77 percent of elementary school students in Portland graduate without taking an arts class and found its numbers reliable. What we couldn’t be sure about was whether the group was actually examining the same thing the federal department was examining. Could the two statistics be compared? That’s always difficult, Jarratt Miller said. "In any case, I believe that at the 30,000 foot level (how many schools provide some level of instruction in art or music), we have successfully pulled comparable data from Portland and from this national study," she wrote in an e-mail. Our concern was that the national study simply asked whether schools were "offering instruction designated specifically for various arts subjects" whereas the Portland figures were looking at the number of schools employing a teacher specifically for an arts field. The difference is important because a school could offer art instruction in a classroom -- as many Portland schools do -- without explicitly employing an art teacher. Lucky for us, the national study looked at who was teaching those subjects. It found that specialists were teaching the music classes 91 percent of the time and the arts classes 84 percent of the time. Other schools had classroom teachers doing art instruction or brought in outside volunteers and artists-in-residence. This doesn’t necessarily clarify how closely CAN and the fed’s numbers can be compared. But it does seem to demonstrate that a gulf exists. If you do the math, you find that about 70 percent of U.S. elementary schools offer visual arts classes that are taught by a specialist (someone with a teaching certificate in an arts discipline), whereas only 18 percent of Portland schools have a dedicated teacher for visual arts. And, in truth, that 18 percent might have to be shifted lower to match the federal statistic perfectly because CAN didn’t ask schools to note whether their art teachers were certified in any way, though Jarratt Miller suspects most are. Even an 18 to 70 percent split seemed too big to be true to us. We asked Jarratt Miller what some of the causes could be. Part of it, she said, was the simple fact that Oregon has no statewide art education requirements, unlike most other states. (That seemed strange to us -- but the Oregon Department of Education confirmed it.) That brings us to our ruling. The figures Adams used in his tweet both come from reliable sources. We’re not sure they can be perfectly compared, but even if you do your best to chip away at the national number, you’re still left with a dramatic gulf in which 70 percent of elementary schools nationally say they offer art education with a certified art teacher while only 18 percent of Portland-area schools can likely say the same. The general point here, that Portland is falling behind the national average for art education is as accurate as it is startling. We rate this claim True.

pomt-13574	On the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	full flop	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/22/pat-toomey/pat-toomeys-shifting-stance-trans-pacific-partners/	Sen. Pat Toomey has historically been one of the most pro-trade lawmakers in the Senate. The Pennsylvania Republican -- now in the political fight of his life in an attempt to keep his seat -- even wrote a book in 2009 called The Road to Prosperity, which touted the benefits of free trade. But last week, Toomey penned an op-ed that appeared in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette denouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal being spearheaded by the Obama administration, writing "we should not pass a flawed deal just to get a deal done." He continued: "We should dump the TPP and return to the negotiating table to get an agreement that would create jobs and economic growth here at home." Coming from Toomey, this stance was surprising, largely because the senator last year voted for and applauded the Trade Promotion Authority that was largely branded as a way for Washington to fast-track the TPP. So did Toomey flip-flop his stance on the TPP, especially as public support for the deal fades? We’re not making a judgement call on the policy itself, but let’s look at the facts of whether or not Toomey changed his stance. The TPP would be one of the largest regional trade deals in history. It involves the United States and 11 other countries -- including Japan, Australia, Mexico and Singapore -- on the Pacific rim that represent a third of worldwide trade, and has been seen as an effort by the Obama administration to lessen China’s influence in the region. But the deal has left both parties split, as some consider the effort to be one that will kill jobs in the United States and encourage foreign outsourcing. Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders greatly opposed the deal, as has Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who once supported the TPP as secretary of state, came out against it as a presidential candidate, and PolitiFact rated it a Full Flop. Toomey’s spokeswoman E.R. Anderson says Toomey never made a decision on his support for the TPP. Meanwhile, his opponent Democrat Katie McGinty has been launching public attacks on Toomey over the last week, claiming his stance on TPP is a 180 compared to what he said before. "Pat Toomey has spent his entire career pushing bad trade deals and policies that ship Americans jobs overseas, so nobody is buying this ridiculous flip flop," McGinty said in a statement. Her campaign has pointed out that in 2015, Toomey voted in favor of the Trade Promotion Authority, or the TPA, which was known as the "fast-track" bill. That legislation was basically a procedural vote in Congress that would make it easier for a final trade deal to pass because it requires lawmakers give a final trade deal an up or down vote without making any amendments. The Obama administration said this was a critical step in the process of negotiating with the other countries involved in the TPP. Before the TPA was passed, Toomey appeared on "Morning Joe" on MSNBC and urged support for the bill’s passage, saying "this trade agreement is going to knock down barriers to allow us to export more manufactured goods from Pennsylvania." The interview was branded as being about the TPA. But interviewer Joe Scarborough asked Toomey about "the trade deal." Toomey went on to discuss "countries that we’re dealing with," implying he was talking about the TPP -- not the TPA, which was a congressional procedural amendment. "This helps to encourage economic growth in the United States, job creation in Pennsylvania and the United States, and importantly Joe, you know these countries that we’re dealing with, they’re changing, they’re evolving some of them are rapidly developing," Toomey said during the interview. "They’re either going to do that under the influence of the Chinese, who are very aggressively trying to insert themselves, or they’re going to do it with us." MSNBC showed a graphic of countries involved with the TPP, and Scarborough asked Toomey, "Isn’t this one more step in a globalization process that has gutted manufacturing not only in Pennsylvania, but across America?" Toomey, responded "no" and said, "we’ve got an opportunity with this trade agreement to knock down some of the barriers that keep our products out, so I think this is going to be very constructive." At no point during the interview did Toomey say he was waiting to reserve judgement on the substance of the TPP, unlike other senators who voted in favor of the TPA. Democrat Sen. Tim Kaine, now Clinton’s running mate, also voted in favor of the TPA, but was explicit at the time in saying he would not vote in favor of the TPP once negotiations were finalized if it didn’t include certain assurances. Kaine has since come out against the TPP. When the TPA was passed, Toomey’s office put out a press release reading: "Today, we are a big step closer toward creating more jobs, lifting wages, and boosting economic growth for Pennsylvania." The statement continued: "In fact, at a Senate Finance Committee hearing in April senior administration officials assured me that if the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is enacted, our state would likely see a further surge in exports." Again, Toomey didn’t express that he waiting on negotiations to conclude before he made an endorsement of the TPP itself. Now, Anderson says that was simply an approval of the TPA and an expression of optimism that a final TPP deal would "be good for Pennsylvania." "He’s not saying anything is a direct correlation," Anderson said. "He’s saying this process will lead to negotiations that lead to a better result, and the result is not to his liking." Joshua P. Meltzer, a senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development department at the Brookings Institute, told PolitiFact that though the TPP could likely not have been completed without the TPA, the TPA was not created solely for the passage of the TPP. For instance, he said, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trade in Services Agreement could also be passed under TPA if finished in time. "The debate around TPA, while certainly influenced by the expected completion of TPP," he said, "was more general in nature and focused on the impacts of trade more broadly than the specific benefits of TPP." Toomey wrote in the Post-Gazette op-ed that his biggest problems with the TPP are that one, he believes there aren’t enough intellectual property protections for innovations in the life science and pharmaceutical sectors, and two, he says the TPP falls short in its protections for dairy farms in Pennsylvania who largely depend on exports. However, during that 2015 MSNBC interview, Toomey told Scarborough: "It's definitely going to increase our ability to sell agricultural products overseas. It's going to help to protect the intellectual property of some of our really terrifically dynamic companies like pharmaceuticals and medical device companies." McGinty has been against the TPP, but did support the North American Free Trade Agreement 20 years ago while working in the White House’ Office of Environmental Policy under former President Bill Clinton. Our Ruling Pat Toomey wrote in an op-ed this week that he’s against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, though he voted in favor of a bill in 2015 that fast-tracked its passage. While experts say voting in favor of the Trade Promotion Authority legislation wasn’t necessarily a symbolic vote of confidence in the TPP, the final outcome was that the TPP couldn’t have happened without it. In addition, Toomey -- who has been largely pro-trade in the past -- was interviewed on MSNBC last year and supported a trade deal, not just the TPA, which was a procedural vote in Congress. Asked multiple times during the interview, Toomey touted the benefits of a trade deal and didn’t temper his feelings by saying he’d reserve judgement on the TPP until negotiations wrapped up. He only says now, while he’s up for re-election, that he wanted to wait to decide on whether or not he supported TPP. We rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-04692	Women "receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/05/diana-degette/diana-degette-says-women-earn-77-cents-every-dolla/	Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., invoked a well-worn statistic to illustrate how women earn less than men during her speech at the Democratic National Convention. "More and more in this economy, the women are the family breadwinners. We are managing our family budgets, struggling to pay healthcare bills and facing the challenge of saving for college," DeGette said during her Sept. 5, 2012, speech. "We feel it in our paychecks when we receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." We’ve heard this statistic often, and not during just the convention. Lilly Ledbetter, the namesake of Obama’s first signed bill, used it in her speech the night before, and Obama used it -- inaccurately -- in a campaign ad this summer. This statistic is factual when applied correctly. DeGette did a fine job of describing the figure, though 77 cents isn’t the definitive measure of the gender gap. (It happens to be the widest.) Politicians get income data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Census Bureau, which tracks annual wages, found women who worked full-time, year-round in 2010 made 77 cents for every dollar men earned across the country. This comparison includes all male and female workers regardless of occupation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses different measures to analyze the pay gap, including weekly wages. In 2010, women working full-time had median weekly earnings of $669, versus $824 for males, according to a BLS report released in 2011. So women earned 81 cents of every dollar earned by men, which has been typical since 2004. What’s the difference? Unlike the measure of annual wages by the Census Bureau, the weekly wage analysis does not account for people who are self-employed. It does include people left out of the year-round wage measure, such as some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers. Another measure -- hourly rates -- shows a smaller degree of pay disparity. According to BLS data, women are paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men. This evaluation accounts for part-time (fewer than 35 hours) workers, which are more often women and are paid less than their salaried counterparts. Women paid by the hour made median hourly earnings of $11.83, compared to $13.76 for men. We wondered which figure is best. Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, prefers the measure of annual wages, which do not exclude salaried workers as the hourly measure does. "It’s the one that goes back the furthest in time," she said. "It’s the one that is most traditional." But some researchers, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, prefer working with hourly wages, arguing "an incomplete picture" is cast with weekly earnings because women work fewer hours than men, "which would make a gap in weekly earnings between the two groups substantial even if their hourly wages are the same." Hartmann’s think tank analyzed pay parity for the top 20 occupations for women in 2011 using median weekly earnings. The center found the pay gap varies depending on the field, though women lag in nearly every category. Consider nurses (96 cents to every dollar), cashiers (90 cents), accountants (77 cents) and financial advisers (66 cents). So how much of a role does discrimination play? Hartmann attributed anywhere from one-quarter to one-third of the gap to direct discrimination by the employer. The U.S. Department of Labor put it around 40 percent in a blog post on this topic. A woman’s ties to child care is also factored in, with studies saying this obligation restricts her career options and hours. Women also more often choose occupations with lower wages, obtain degrees that lead to lower-paying jobs than men, and take more time off from work for pregnancy and child care, according to a 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh. Men and women historically enter certain fields more than others -- a phenomenon known as "occupational segregation." Women more often choose to be receptionists, nurses and teachers, while men pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. Our ruling DeGette claimed women "receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." The measure comes from a valid source, though other comparisons indicate the gap is tighter. Also, some occupations have smaller gaps than others. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Diana DeGette	None	None	None	2012-09-05T21:38:05	2012-09-05	['None']
pomt-10446	"Obama ... gave almost a million dollars to the (Kenya) opposition campaign who just happened to be his cousin, Raila Odinga."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/02/chain-email/not-a-cent-from-unrelated-obama/	A chain e-mail that originates with a letter from American missionaries working in Kenya warns about Sen. Barack Obama's ties to Kenya and its opposition party, encouraging readers "not to be taken in by those that are promoting him." Among the many allegations is one about Obama's ties to Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga: "Obama under 'friends of Obama' gave almost a million dollars to the (Kenya) opposition campaign who just happened to be his cousin, Raila Odinga, who is a socialist trained in East Germany." The e-mail reads like a bad game of "telephone," its claims drawn from assorted people and sources that have been stitched together. And yet, because it is signed by real people, who have a life in Africa, it somehow carries more credence than your average blog posting — and it's spreading rapidly. ( Read the e-mail here. ) But even with the credibility of a real author, the claims in this e-mail are as baseless as anything you've read from an anonymous blogger. Celeste Davis wrote the letter. Her husband, Loren Davis, spoke to PolitiFact at length about its many allegations. He says they've lived and worked in Kenya for the past 12 years and this was a personal letter "never intended to be forwarded or sent out to the Web." "It's totally caught us by surprise," Loren Davis said. He went on to back up the claims and provide some evidence. Let's examine this one in two parts: • "Obama under 'friends of Obama' gave almost a million dollars to the (Kenya) opposition campaign." Loren Davis provided PolitiFact with a document that he says shows Obama gave $1-million to the Kenyan opposition campaign led by Odinga. A header at the top of the page says it's a "consolidated statement of campaign financial activities." Under the header is a list of "incoming resources" with entries listed in columns of "from" and "amount." Handwritten notes amplify the point being made. A name on the list is underlined and the words "Barak Obama" are written in the margin, suggesting that donation is from the Illinois senator, even though his name is misspelled. The amount across from this name also is underlined and next to it someone has written "$1 million," implying Obama contributed $1-million. The Obama campaign strongly disputes this allegation and three Kenya experts who reviewed the document at our request called it fraudulent. The Obama campaign sent PolitiFact the same document and one other purporting to show Obama's campaign contributions to Kenya. The first they heard of it was when these documents arrived by fax. See the documents here and here. On the legible version, you can see the underlined entry says, "Friends of Senator BO," presumably Barack Obama. Only, there is no political action committee named Friends of Senator BO or Friends of Barack Obama. So says Obama's campaign. And a search of the Federal Election Commission Web site and Opensecrets.org, the Web site of the Center for Responsive Politics, pulls up neither. In fact, there's no PAC name even close. Not to mention, the Obama campaign says the senator never gave money to Kenyan Prime Minister Odinga. And Salim Lone, spokesman for Odinga whom we spoke with in Kenya, confirms that. "That is absolutely ridiculous," Lone said in an interview with PolitiFact. "Mr. Obama did not donate a single cent to Mr. Odinga's campaign." Just to be certain, we did an analysis of Federal Election Commission reports of disbursements from Obama's principal presidential campaign committee, Obama for America, during the 2008 election cycle. We searched for "Kenya," "Odinga" and "ODM," (the Orange Democratic Movement) the latter being Odinga's political party, and came up with no matches. ( UPDATE: In June 2008, a reader correctly pointed out that there was a "Friends of Barack Obama" PAC on the Illinois state level from 1995-2005. We analyzed reports of disbursements from this PAC, searching for "Kenya," "Odinga" and "ODM." We came up with no matches.) And what about the second part of the quote? • "Who just happened to be his cousin, Raila Odinga, who is a socialist trained in East Germany." This part of the claim stems from an interview Odinga did with BBC News in January 2008. ( Listen to it here. ) In a discussion about the political situation in Kenya amid fallout from a disputed election — where Odinga's party rejected official results and vowed to install Odinga as the "people's president" — the following exchange occurs: Odinga: "Barack Obama's father is my maternal uncle." BBC: "You're related to him?" Odinga: "Yes, I am." No, you're not, says the Obama campaign. We spoke to three Kenya experts who dismiss this part of the claim as well, suggesting Odinga made the connection to give himself more legitimacy during the political crisis. "It's stretched to the point of ridiculousness," said Joel D. Barkan, political science professor emeritus at the University of Iowa and senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. "To my knowledge, they are not first cousins in the normal sense. To my knowledge, there's absolutely no relationship at all." Alex Awiti, a Kenyan postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University, says you have to consider the context of when Odinga was speaking, that being in the middle of a political crisis. "Raila Odinga was groping all over the place, trying to find some political legitimacy to get on a high pedestal to claim leadership and using Obama was basically going to add some political points," said Awiti, who lived in Kenya until three years ago. "This is very opportunistic and it should be totally disregarded." Lone, Odinga's spokesman, said cousins in the African sense is very different from cousins in the American sense, so they might be distant relatives. As far as being trained in East Germany, Odinga's own Web site says he attended Herder Institute in Leipzig, Germany, and earned a master's degree from the Otto von Guericke Technical Institute in Magdeburg, Germany. Both cities were part of the former East Germany. But again, our Kenya experts say that doesn't make him a socialist. "It should have said he was a socialist trained in East Germany," Barkan said. "He's populist politics, but he's no socialist." A nugget of truth in a mountain of wholesale inaccuracy does nothing to diminish our ruling on this irresponsible claim. Neither does the fact the American author says it wasn't meant for worldwide distribution. This is Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-09722	Barack Obama wrote a thesis at Columbia University in which he criticized "plutocratic thugs" and said the Constitution gave Americans "the shackles of hypocrisy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/26/blog-posting/obamas-columbia-thesis-all-fiction-dreamed-blogger/	When we last spoke with Matthew Avitabile, a grad student in upstate New York who writes a blog called Jumping in Pools, he had stirred up a hornet's nest with a satirical posting that claimed President Barack Obama wanted soldiers to stop taking an oath to the Constitution and instead pledge their loyalty to the president himself. That put some conservative bloggers into a tizzy. "Good g*d — Obama is an egomaniac like we've never seen before. Another Hitler on the rise. This guy is just trashing everything the Consitution stands for," wrote someone named Kitty on the blog Tree of Liberty. The report kept spreading, getting picked up by other bloggers and circulating as a chain e-mail. It earned a Pants on Fire from our Truth-O-Meter. Avitabile, a 22-year-old State University of New York at Albany grad student and self-described moderate Republican, told us back in February that he was surprised the posting — which was labeled satire — could spread so quickly without people verifying the facts. "People wanted to believe this about the president so bad, that he would really go toward a dictatorship so much, that they would go with it without checking it," he said. Now comes another satirical claim from Avitabile's blog that made it all the way to Rush Limbaugh's show before being debunked. It says that Obama criticized "plutocratic thugs" in his thesis at Columbia University: "Obama was required to write a 'senior seminar' paper in order to graduate from Columbia. The subject of this paper, which totaled 44 pages, was American government. Entitled Aristocracy Reborn, this paper chronicled the long struggle of the working class against, as Obama put it, 'plutocratic thugs with one hand on the money and the other on the government.' "In the paper, in which only the first ten pages were given to the general media, Obama decries the plight of the poor: 'I see poverty in every place I walk. In Los Angeles and New York, the poor reach to me with bleary eyes and all I can do is sigh.' "In part, the future President blames this on the current economic system: 'There are many who will defend the 'free market.' But who will defend the single mother of four working three jobs. When a system is allowed to be free at the expense of its citizens, then it is tyranny.' "However, the President also singled out the American Constitution: '... the Constitution allows for many things, but what it does not allow is the most revealing. The so-called Founders did not allow for economic freedom. While political freedom is supposedly a cornerstone of the document, the distribution of wealth is not even mentioned. While many believed that the new Constitution gave them liberty, it instead fitted them with the shackles of hypocrisy.' "It is yet unknown if more of this thesis will be released. It was also noted that the President received an A- for the paper, which later led to his graduation." The blog posting gained credibility because the "satire" label was small and easy to miss, and it falsely claimed that Time magazine columnist Joe Klein uncovered the thesis. "With all of the secrecy regarding the President's academic record," the blogger wrote, "famed Time reporter Joe Klein looked into the records for an upcoming special edition about the President. Klein included several key points in the piece, including his grades and stellar letters of recommendation. However, what has leaked along with this information was the subject of a thesis written by the young Obama while still an undergraduate at Columbia." Avitabile said he intended the item to be satire, but not over-the-top-obvious satire. "If you have to explain a joke, it's not funny," he said. "I kind of get inspiration from Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal. You want people to be let in and then at the end, they realize it, and either find it funny on its own terms or find their reaction to be funny." The satire was too subtle for many people, though. The item appeared to go unnoticed for weeks. Then, on Oct. 21, 2009, Michael Ledeen of Pajamas Media, a political blog, wrote about Obama's alleged thesis: "That’s quite an indictment, even for an Ivy League undergraduate. I wonder if the prof – and I’d like to know who the prof was – made an appropriate marginal comment, something about historical context, about the Constitution’s revolutionary status in the history of freedom, and about the separation of powers in order to make the creation of any 'shackles' as difficult as possible." Just two days later, on Oct. 23, Rush Limbaugh cited it it in a sharp attack on Obama. "The Constitution is the most liberty-promoting and freedom-acknowledging document in the history of the world, and this little boy in college is writing about it with utter disdain, and he still shares those feelings," Limbaugh told listeners. He added, "So Joe Klein at Time magazine has known for a long time about Obama's college thesis when he was at Columbia. Why didn't this come out a year ago at this time? Why didn't this come out before the election in November?" Within minutes, though, the story began falling apart. While he was still on air, Limbaugh received notice from a listener who was skeptical of the thesis story and found nothing to back it up. So the host began to backtrack. "I'm also told that the blog containing the passage on Obama's thesis is a satire blog," he said later in the same show. "So I shout from the mountaintops, 'It was satire!' But we know [Obama] thinks it. Good comedy, to be comedy, must contain an element of truth, and we know how he feels about distribution of wealth. He's mad at the courts for not going far enough on it. So we stand by the fabricated quote because we know Obama thinks it anyway. That's how it works in the media today." Klein later confirmed on Time's Swampland blog that he had "never seen Obama's thesis," and other bloggers followed with contrite apologies. "I should have picked up some hint, but I didn’t," Ledeen posted on Oct. 23. "Shame on me." Meredith Jessup of TownHall.com followed suit the same day, but she added, "it's important to note that none of this nonsense would be running wild around the Internet if the campaign had just released Obama's thesis in the first place." Which might be a fair question – if there had been a thesis at all. But there wasn't. A Columbia University spokesman told PolitiFact that "an undergraduate thesis requirement for those in political science did not even exist at Columbia in 1983." In other words, Obama couldn't have written a thesis because no Columbia political science student in his era did. Yet the conviction that a thesis is out there has driven critics to search everywhere for it. The elusive Obama "thesis," it seems, stems from in an inadvertent slip of the tongue by one of Obama's former professors. In 2007, when Obama was serving in the Senate and gearing up for the first presidential primaries and caucuses, New York Times reporter Janny Scott assembled a story about Obama's years in New York, including his time as an undergraduate at Columbia. She managed to track down Michael Baron, who had taught a senior seminar on international politics and American policy for eight students, including Obama, in 1983. Baron, now a digital media executive for a Sarasota-based company, mistakenly used the term "thesis" when he spoke with the New York Times reporter, which sent reporters scurrying to find it. "Journalists began hounding Columbia University for copies of the musty document," wrote Jim Popkin, an NBC News senior investigative producer in a July 2008 blog posting. "Conservative bloggers began wondering if the young Obama had written a no-nukes screed that he might come to regret. And David Bossie, the former congressional investigator and 'right-wing hit man,' as one newspaper described him, took out classified newspaper ads in Columbia University’s newspaper and the Chicago Tribune in March searching for the term paper." But Obama's paper was nowhere to be found. While the paper was the fruit of a yearlong course, it's not something the university would have saved. "It was not like a master's or doctoral thesis that gets collected and put on microfiche," Baron told PolitiFact. Baron, who donated to Obama's campaign, ultimately received about two dozen calls from journalists, some from as far away as Japan and Europe, about the missing "thesis." The former professor insists that there was nothing damaging in the 25- to 40-page paper on nuclear disarmament, which earned Obama an A, and certainly nothing about shortcomings of the Constitution or the distribution of wealth, as the blog post indicated. "The students did not write papers about a policy being good or bad," Baron said. "It was about decisionmaking — who should be listened to and how to avoid narrow thinking." Avitabile, asked whether he would continue to publish satire on his site, gave an unequivocal yes. And he urged readers of all blogs to be vigilant. "I encourage anyone who's on the Internet, make sure it's linked to an accredited news source," he said. "If you do pass it along, you should say, 'This is probably fake, but this says the president is a lizard." So once again, satire from Jumping in Pools has triggered an avalanche of unwarranted outrage. And so for the many bloggers who spread the incorrect information, we set the meter ablaze – Pants on Fire. And check your facts next time, okay?

pomt-11663	The Dow Jones Industrial Average "jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-dow-jones-had-its-fastest-ever-/	In the wake of the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching the 25,000-point landmark, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to tout a new record. "Dow goes from 18,589 on November 9, 2016, to 25,075 today, for a new all-time Record. Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history. This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. Six trillion dollars in value created!" he tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered whether Trump was accurate that the Dow’s 1,000-point move in five weeks was a jump of record proportions. He’s right. Here’s a table summarizing every time the Dow has crossed a 1,000-level threshold for the first time since its establishment as a stock-measurement statistic in 1896. The chart below only includes the first time the Dow crossed a threshold; in many cases, the market closed below that level before climbing above it permanently. First finish above... Date of milestone 1,000 Nov. 14, 1972 2,000 Jan. 8, 1987 3,000 April 17, 1991 4,000 Feb. 23, 1995 5,000 Nov. 21, 1995 6,000 Oct. 14, 1996 7,000 Feb. 13, 1997 8,000 July 16, 1997 9,000 Apr. 6, 1998 10,000 Mar. 29, 1999 11,000 May 3, 1999 12,000 Oct. 19, 2006 13,000 Apr. 25, 2007 14,000 July 19, 2007 15,000 May 7, 2013 16,000 Nov. 21, 2013 17,000 July 3, 2014 18,000 Dec. 23, 2014 19,000 Nov. 22, 2016 20,000 Jan. 25, 2017 21,000 Mar. 1, 2017 22,000 Aug. 2, 2017 23,000 Oct. 18, 2017 24,000 Nov. 30, 2017 25,000 Jan. 4, 2018 The most recent climb to 25,000 is a record, after you exclude weekends and holidays and include only trading days. The climb from 24,000 to 25,000 took 24 trading days. That is one day shorter than the two previous fastest climbs of 25 trading days — from 10,000 to 11,000 under President Bill Clinton in 1999, and from 20,000 to 21,000 earlier in Trump’s own presidency. With each 1,000-level increase, the accomplishment is a little less impressive. A jump of 1,000 from 24,000 to 25,000 is an increase of just 4 percent in value. By comparison, jumping from 1,000 to 2,000 — which took more than 14 years — is an increase of 100 percent in value. Our ruling Trump said the Dow Jones Industrial Average "jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history." He’s correct about the size of the climb and the fact that it’s the fastest in history, at least when you tally up trading days. The rise to 25,000 beat the old record by one trading day.

pomt-03145	There "are 500 registered Republicans moving" to Texas "every day."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/sep/11/steve-munisteri/its-hard-prove-public-data-500-republicans-move-te/	Texas Republicans who have long dominated statewide politics enjoy another advantage, the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas declared. "We know there are 500 registered Republicans moving to the state every day," Steve Munisteri said on the Aug. 19, 2013, edition of YNN’s "Capital Tonight" program. We do? Texas is among at least 20 states whose residents are not asked to register party affiliations when they register to vote, according to registration laws summarized online by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. So identifying new Texans as partisan one way or another seems potentially ticklish. On YNN, Munisteri continued: "There’s only about 1,000 to 1,300 total people moving to the state" daily and that includes children and non-registered voters. In January 2010, we rated as Mostly True a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that 1,000 people a day moved here. IRS data tied to changes of address in 2007 and 2008 suggested that more than 1,300 people a day were relocating, on average. Munisteri told YNN: "So we believe a majority of the people moving to the state of Texas are actually registered Republicans, 94,000 just... from January to June," though he later told us that he meant through June. "So we expect by next fall, that between election cycles, we would have had over 400,000 Republicans that were registered Republicans in other states move to Texas" and, he said, the party was intent on contacting and registering such newcomers. By email and telephone, Munisteri told us the Republican National Committee, the party’s national governing group, provides the Texas party with a regularly updated list of Republicans or likely Republicans who have moved into Texas counties from other states, though he said the list also folds in residents moving to a county from another Texas county. Broadly, Munisteri said, "the RNC uses their data points and they have some sort of scoring system, such as whether people have voted in the Republican primary before, how many times, or other data points," such as magazine subscriptions or memberships in conservative groups, "that indicate if the people are Republican, Democrat or Independent." Munisteri said the RNC-provided list he relied on for his YNN comment encompassed individuals who moved in the first half of 2013. Separately, he said, the party has a list of 59,000 people who moved to Texas from January through July 2013 and who previously voted in a Democratic primary. The contrasting figures, he said, support his conclusion that new-to-Texas Republicans greatly outnumber such Democrats. Munisteri said he didn’t know how the RNC identified the people who had moved and couldn’t give us copies of the relevant lists. The RNC press secretary, Kirsten Kukowski, confirmed by email that the committee works with state parties to identify voters moving into states. Declining to elaborate, she wrote: "We don’t discuss our methods and tactics with the media." Watch out: Paragraphs of math ahead. Munisteri’s first equation: Take the 94,000 Republicans or Republican leaners and divide by the 181 days in the six months to get 519 Republicans a day moving to Texas counties. Equation 2: Compare the 94,000 figure for six months to the declared count of 59,000 Democrats moving into Texas over seven months and adjust for the Democratic figure’s additional month, Munisteri said. By his calculation, he said, this comparison supports the judgment that 65 percent of all voter-movers were Republican or Republican-leaning. Multiply the 65 percent by the widely bandied 1,300 people a day moving to Texas, Munisteri said, and take the resulting 845 and divide by two to remove children (who, of course, cannot vote) to estimate that 423 Republicans move to Texas every day, a total Munisteri called "fairly consistent" with his other result. Next, we sought perspective from other experts and advocates including Democratic attorney Michael Li of Dallas and the Battleground Texas group, which seeks to escalate Democratic registration and turnout, both of whom sounded skeptical of the 500-a-day figure. Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, and Brian W. Smith, a St. Edward’s University political scientist, each pointed out, that according to the American Community Survey overseen by the U.S. Census Bureau, about 1,400 people a day moved to the state from other states in 2011. That figure doesn’t account for some 1,100 estimated daily departures that year. Potter noted that between 2011 and 2012, Texas had 141,000 net domestic migrants, or about 386 a day, according to the census bureau’s population estimates and IRS data. Meanwhile, the American Community Survey estimated a 2011 net in-flow of 301 residents a day, Potter said. "The population estimates don’t break it out by flows between states," Potter wrote. Still, he noted, both sets of estimates "put the number of net domestic migrants well below 1,000-1,300." Moreover, he said, a "substantial significant proportion" of the domestic migrants into Texas "are probably not eligible to vote (i.e. less than 18 or non-citizens) and some of the domestic migrants might" align with other political parties. Ultimately, Potter said in another email, it’s feasible that 500 Republicans a day move to Texas--or perhaps 500 Democrats, he said. But without factual information on residents’ partisan leans, he said, he wouldn’t embrace any such judgments. Smith, citing 2011 census estimates, agreed that when you subtract individuals leaving Texas from the greater amount of individuals moving into the state, it looks like the net increase totals about 300 people a day. "No matter how" Munisteri "swings it," Smith wrote, "they’re not adding 500 Republicans a day when you include who is leaving" the state. Then again, Munisteri did not say there was that much of a net increase each day. Setting aside people who leave Texas, Smith said, the Census Bureau’s 2011 estimate was that 1,410 people a day moved to the state. To speculate that 500 of each day’s arrivals were Republicans, he said, one would need to assume that all the new residents were adult citizens eligible to vote--and that 35 percent were Republicans. That’s plausible, Smith said. Nationally, Smith noted, the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press in June 2012 found that 40 percent of Americans leaned Republican, with 48 percent leaning Democratic. This doesn’t take into consideration an age wrinkle, Smith said. If one assumes that about 24 percent of the movers into Texas were younger than 18, which would be in keeping with national estimates, he said, then some 46 percent of the remaining estimated 1,079 daily movers into Texas would need to be Republican or leaning that way for there to be 500 new Republicans a day. That’s less plausible, he said. If 46 percent of Americans were Republicans, Smith speculated, Mitt Romney would have won the presidency. Munisteri, alerted to the analyses of Potter and Smith, said by phone that his 500 figure might be overly high. Still, he said, it’s reasonable to say several hundred Republicans a day have been moving to Texas. Our ruling Munisteri said 500 Republicans a day move to Texas. The chairman laid out equations seemingly supporting this conclusion, though a complete analysis of Republican/Democratic ups and downs would take into account factors including Texas births, deaths and departures. Besides, as Census Bureau estimates indicate, even if one focuses only on individuals moving into the state, it’s a challenge to demonstrate that 500 Republicans move in daily. In the end, too, the party did not divulge its lists of movers to Texas, making it impossible to directly probe the accuracy of Munisteri's aired counts. These weaknesses signify vital missing details.

pomt-00628	"The United States is one of only seven nations that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/may/26/family-foundation/family-foundation-says-us-among-seven-nations-allo/	The Family Foundation, a socially conservative Virginia group, recently applauded the U.S. House’s passage of a bill that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. "The United States is one of only seven nations that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization..." the organization said in a May 14 Facebook post. We wondered whether the global characterization was correct. The U.S. standard for abortion rights was handed down by the Supreme Court in its Roe v. Wade decision of 1973. The court ruled that a woman is entitled to have an elective abortion -- terminate a pregnancy for any reason -- until the point when a fetus can viably survive outside a uterus. Justices cited medical research showing that viability point can begin as early as 24 weeks into the gestation period, which begins on the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period. So women in the United States can get an abortion for any reason until at least 24 weeks of gestation. After 24 weeks, states may set up their own abortion rules and most, including Virginia, generally restrict the procedure at some point to mothers whose health is endangered by pregnancy. The Family Foundation pointed us to a report on global abortion laws published in February 2014 by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, an organization dedicated to ending abortion. It concluded that only seven of 198 nations and territories allow elective abortions after 20 weeks: Canada, China, Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, United States and Vietnam. We came up with the same seven countries after sifting through 2014 data published by the Center for Reproductive Rights, a worldwide pro-abortion group. Some might argue there’s an eighth nation, Australia, but this should come with a qualification. Although Australia has no federal abortion law, it allows each of its states and territories to set its own guidelines. Some of those regions have tight restrictions but one -- Victoria, on the populous southeastern coast --allows an elective abortion until the 24th week of pregnancy. Although the Lozier Institute and the Center for Reproductive Rights are at cross purposes, they agree on other broad characterizations of global abortion laws. The institute says 59 nations allow abortion without restriction at some point in pregnancy and 139 require some reason for the procedure, such as saving the life or health of the mother. The center says 61 countries allow early abortions without restriction, 109 require a reason for it and 29 ban the procedure. The two organizations disagree mightily, however, on how the data should be interpreted. The Lozier Institute, in its report, said the figures show the U.S. is outside "the international mainstream" on abortion and has "ultra-permissive abortion policies." But Katherine Mayall, global advocacy adviser for the center, told us the data is an "imperfect way to think about abortion laws. What’s important is access to clinics. In Europe, you don’t see the efforts to limit access to clinics you see in the United States." We should note that House bill banning most abortions after the 20th week is expected to be blocked by Senate Democrats and, even if it does pass in the chamber, faces a promised veto from President Barack Obama. And one final note: In 2013, PolitiFact National gave a Half True rating to a statement by Carly Fiorina, now a GOP presidential candidate, that the U.S. was among "four nations that legalize abortion after five months." PolitiFact Texas gave the same rating that year to an almost identical claim made by Anita Perry, the wife of then Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Both statements were downgraded because many countries allow abortions after 20 weeks for special circumstances, such as if the mother’s life is endangered. The Family Foundation’s statement is different from Fiorina’s and Perry’s because the organization specified it was referring to elective abortions after 20 weeks. Our ruling The Family Foundation says, "The United States is one of only seven nations that allows elective abortions after 20 weeks post-fertilization." Separate research by pro- and anti-abortion rights groups back up claim. We won’t quibble over whether Australia should be added to the group of seven. We find the statement True.

pomt-11351	"For what it would cost the (National) Guard to make just two arrests at the border, we could give a homeless veteran permanent housing for an entire year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/05/ruben-gallego/arizona-rep-cost-2-national-guard-border-arrests-w/	President Donald Trump’s decision to send National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border has drawn a mixed response. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey welcomed the move, while California Gov. Jerry Brown’s National Guard said it would "review" the request. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., had a specific complaint: He said it was a poor use of tax dollars. "Using the National Guard to do border security is very expensive," Gallego tweeted April 3. "For what it would cost the Guard to make just TWO arrests at the border, we could give a homeless veteran permanent housing for an entire year." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Gallego’s office said they had the numbers to back that up and pointed to several news articles. We went to government reports and filings for the data, and with a caveat about who actually makes arrests at the border, the statement checks out. The cost of an arrest In 2012, the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined the costs and benefits of deploying National Guard troops at the border. The auditing arm of Congress had two examples to study. Operation Jump Start ran from June 2006 to July 2008 under President George W. Bush. President Barack Obama initiated Operation Phalanx between July 2010 and September 2011. There were slight differences in the Guard’s activities. For example, Operation Jump Start involved aviation while Operation Phalanx did not. But by and large, they operated under the same rules. The guardsmen helped spot illegal border crossers, while Customs and Border Patrol officers made the actual arrests. So, to be clear, while Gallego referred to arrests, the National Guardsmen arrested no one. The Defense Department told the GAO that the combined cost of both operations for the National Guard was $1.35 billion. CBP officials reported that the National Guard assisted in the apprehension of 186,814 undocumented aliens under Jump Start, and the apprehension of 17,887 under Phalanx. (Technically, the National Guard operated under Title 32 of the U.S. code. The Defense Department provided assistance separately under Title 10 status. The spending figures reflect the distinction.) The cost per apprehension was $6,595. Trump’s memorandum called for the Secretary of Defense to request the use of the Guard under Title 32. The cost of permanent housing In September 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced the latest round of funding to provide veterans with housing vouchers. It offered about $40 million to "support approximately 5,500 units." That comes to nearly $7,300 per unit. The advocacy group National Coalition for Homeless Veterans uses a higher estimate. "The cost of providing permanent supportive housing and case management for a homeless veteran tends to average around $10,000 per person per year," said coalition spokesman Randy Brown. Brown said the price tag would vary from place to place and cited a 2014 report from Central Florida Commission on Homelessness that said housing and support services for any chronically homeless person would cost $10,051 per year. Cost comparison The Trump administration has provided too few details on the proposed deployment to allow a precise cost estimate. But based on past experience, the cost of two apprehensions with National Guard assistance would be $13,190. That is about 30 percent more than the higher estimate to provide permanent housing used by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com If we use the government funding level of $7,300 for housing, the apprehension price tag rises to 80 percent more than housing a homeless veteran for a year. It’s possible that the Trump administration could reduce costs, although a few pieces would need to fall into place. As the Government Accountability Office noted, the National Guardsman were not allowed to arrest people, which increased the number of people needed to apprehend a border crosser. In theory, that could change. "Under Title 32, the governors of those states can authorize troops to perform civil law enforcement, such as apprehending and arresting people," said Leigh M. Winstead with the Veterans and Servicemembers Legal Clinic at George Mason University. Some governors might take that step, but others might not. Winstead said precedent likely allows the president to overrule a governor who refuses, but there could be a legal challenge. In short, while we have credible financial information from the past, the cost of the proposed operation remains unknown. Our ruling Gallego said that the cost of using the National Guard to arrest two people at the border would cover the expense of providing permanent housing to a homeless veteran for a year. Based on past experience, government reports back up Gallego’s comparison. Using data gathered by the Government Accounting Office, National Guard-assisted apprehensions cost $6,595 on average, or about $13,000 for two. According to a homeless vet advocacy group, the cost of providing a home to a veteran is about $10,000, although the government uses a lower figure of $7,300. It is unclear whether the proposed operation would allow the National Guard to make arrests, and whether that would significantly lower the cost per apprehension. However, that effect would need to be large to overcome the gap based on the historic figures. With the caveat about who makes the arrests, we rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Correction: A previous version of this fact-checked misspelled Rep. Gallego's name. The check has been updated.

pomt-02073	Walmart employees receive "roughly $5,800" in public assistance per year.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/23/ed-schultz/ed-schultz-says-walmart-workers-rely-5800-public-a/	Leaders of Portland, Ore., made Ed Schultz a very happy man the other night. The city council recently rolled back the city’s investments in Walmart, faulting the retailer’s labor practices. This comes as a delight to Schultz, liberal host of MSNBC’s The Ed Show, who wants the country’s largest (and non-union) retailer to pay its employees higher wages. Walmart jobs pay so little that many employees turn to public assistance, such as food stamps and Medicaid programs, even though they have fulltime jobs, Schultz said during his May 20 show. He used specific figures that caught our attention. "Walmart workers receive over $2 billion in government assistance each year," he said. "This pencils out to over $1 million in public assistance per store. Easy to figure, isn't it? It’s roughly $5,800 per Walmart employer, employee, those folks that work there, you know?" Walmart’s wages are not a new topic for fact-checkers, but his numbers were higher than any we’ve heard before. We wanted to check them out. The Democrats and their studies Schultz’s $5,800 figure comes from estimates generated by Democrats of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The report relied on 2012 Medicaid enrollment information in the state of Wisconsin, saying it appeared to be recent and comprehensive. Of all employers in the state, Walmart had more employees (just over 3,200) enrolled in Wisconsin’s Medicaid program, which is called BadgerCare+. Factoring in their children and adult dependents, Walmart employees and their families made up about 9,200 BadgerCare+ enrollees. Using that data, House Democrats estimated a typical Walmart Supercenter with 300 employees would cost taxpayers $904,542 a year, or $3,015 per employee. That figure assumes employees who enroll in BadgerCare+ also enroll in other safety net programs supported by taxpayers, such as food stamps, subsidized housing and school lunches, and the Earned Income Tax Credit. The Democrats then made another assumption: That there are likely more Walmart employees who are eligible for BadgerCare+ but choose not to enroll. That could expand the number of workers who receive public assistance. All totaled, Democrats say, a Wisconsin Walmart Supercenter store could cost taxpayers up to $1.745 million per year, or about $5,815 per employee. The report (page 11) breaks out how both costs were tabulated, looking at BadgerCare+, likely family enrollment in free and reduced lunch and breakfast, food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit, Section 8 housing, child care subsidy programs and a residential energy assistance program for low earners. Estimate A looks at the people currently enrolled in BadgerCare+, while Estimate B includes those employees House Democrats believe are eligible but not enrolled in BadgerCare+. As Schultz spoke, a screen behind him displayed the more specific estimates from the report -- without noting they were for a Wisconsin Supercenter. Warnings, Walmart’s response, a progressive critic The top line figure Schultz cited, about $5,800 per employee, is built upon a series of assumptions. It’s including the potential for people to receive federal benefits, rather than actually receiving them -- a point Schultz ignores. And it’s notably looking only at the situation in Wisconsin, where the state’s eligibility requirements for Medicaid are more generous than other states. Wisconsin did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, unlike other states, but its program covers children and pregnant women up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, and it covers adults up to 100 percent. These caveats are crucial. For one, Wisconsin’s minimum wage is in line with the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. A total of 21 states and D.C. have minimum wages above the federal minimum wage. That means some Walmart workers in states outside of Wisconsin are likely to make more, which could mean they are less likely to receive government assistance. The report from House Democrats acknowledges its own limitations. "Because of varying program eligibility requirements across states, extrapolating taxpayer costs for Walmart stores in other states based on the Wisconsin data is difficult," the report says on page 10. Without good data from the company, an exact calculation of public costs for a hypothetical store is "impossible," the reports says in another footnote. Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg zeroed in on those clarifications, criticizing the report and pointing to commentary and research from the man President Barack Obama chose to lead his Council of Economic Advisers, Jason Furman. Before joining the White House, Furman hailed Walmart as a "progressive success story" in a 2005 report (while acknowledging it, "like other retailers and employers of less-skilled workers, does not pay does not pay enough for a family to live the dignified life Americans have come to expect and demand.") Furman said enrolling in Medicaid is the sensible choice for some Walmart employees because it allows employees to save $1,800 a year that they would have spent on company health insurance then. Furman also cites a 2005 memo from Susan Chambers, Walmart's executive vice president for benefits, that claimed 5 percent of Walmart associates were on Medicaid and CHIP (often, state-run insurance programs that help cover families who don’t qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private coverage), compared to an average of national employers of 4 percent and a retail average of 6 percent. Walmart employees signing up for Medicaid isn’t a bad thing, Furman argues, as much as it is a desired result of President Bill Clinton’s welfare reforms to "make work pay," incentivizing people with fewer skills in low-wage jobs to work while remaining eligible for assistance. Still, we know many newspapers and labor-funded organizations in 24 states have looked into Walmart employees’ reliance on public safety nets and found a disproportionately higher share of Walmart workers receiving Medicaid and food stamps than other employers. But should progressives be complaining? Furman argued no in 2005. "It is odd to criticize Walmart because 5 percent of its employees receive Medicaid when the health policy you believe in would ensure that 100 percent of Walmart’s employees received (a better version of) Medicaid," he wrote. A spokeswoman for Schultz’s show did not return emails seeking comment. Our ruling Schultz claimed taxpayers pay "roughly $5,800" per Walmart employee for social safety net programs. That’s a distortion of a narrowly written report that acknowledged its shortcomings. A 2013 analysis from House Democrats relied on several assumptions in attempting to address the situation of Walmart employees in Wisconsin. The $5,800 figure is inflated by including people who are eligible for Wisconsin’s version of Medicaid but not actually enrolled. The report cautions at many points not to accept its findings as representative of Walmart stores across the country, as eligibility requirements for various programs vary across states. None of this made it into Schultz’s on-air takedown of the country’s largest private-sector employer. Schultz’s statement contains an element of truth but needs significantly more information to paint a fuller picture. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08102	The Obama-GOP compromise "raises taxes, it raises the death tax."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/13/jim-demint/sen-jim-demint-says-proposed-tax-compromise-includ/	The compromise agreement on taxes proposed by President Barack Obama -- after negotiating with Republican leaders -- has critics on both ends of the political spectrum. The plan would extend all Bush-era income tax cuts for two years and extend unemployment benefits for another 13 months. Some Democrats have criticized Obama for caving on tax cuts to the wealthy, while some Republicans have complained that the tax cuts were not made permanent. Other Republicans have criticized the lengthy extension of unemployment benefits. On Dec. 7, 2010, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., voiced his opposition to the compromise bill on Hugh Hewitt's nationally syndicated radio show, and the plan's proposal for the estate tax was one of his biggest gripes. "Most of us who ran this election said we were not going to vote for anything that increased the deficit," DeMint said. "This does. It raises taxes, it raises the death tax. I don’t think we needed to negotiate that aspect of this thing away." DeMint's quote was later widely discussed by political pundits such as Keith Olbermann and Sean Hannity. While most of the national debate has focused on the payroll tax provisions, the compromise plan also sets new policy on the estate tax (often called the "death tax" by opponents like DeMint). Specifically, the plan would impose a 35 percent estate tax rate, with an effective exemption of $5 million. DeMint's comment that the compromise "raises the death tax" might seem like a pretty straightforward claim. It either does or it doesn't, right? It all depends on what you use as the baseline. This year, there was no estate tax. But 2010 was an anomaly. In 2009, the rate was 45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million. In the years prior to that, the rate was even higher. And barring new legislation, the rate was set to revert back to 55 percent on the value of estates greater than $1 million in 2011. A little history on the estate tax puts things into better perspective. First enacted in 1916, the estate tax rates and thresholds have fluctuated over the years. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed a plan to gradually reduce the estate tax from 55 percent to 45 percent, while at the same increasing the exemption value from $1 million in 2002 to $3.5 million in 2009. In 2010, the Bush plan had the estate tax disappear completely. That allowed more than five billionaires this year to pass their fortunes on to heirs tax-free. The most famous beneficiary was the estate of New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who died in July. Also benefiting was the estate of Texas pipeline tycoon Dan L. Duncan, who died in March and was worth an estimated $9 billion. The Bush plan had a 10-year window, though, because Republicans didn't have the votes at the time to permanently abolish the estate tax. It passed the Senate under budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority of 51 votes but which also limited it to a 10-year shelf life. So the plan reached the Republicans' ultimate goal of getting rid of the estate tax -- but only in its last year. At the time, Republicans hoped that in ensuing years they would get enough votes to do away with the estate tax permanently. In fact, they tried in 2005, but failed. Last year, Democrats controlling Congress tried to make the 2009 estate tax rates (45 percent on the value of estates over $3.5 million) permanent. But the plan never reached a vote in the Senate. Again, the compromise proposed by Obama last week would set the rate at 35 percent on the value of estates over $5 million. Is that an increase in the estate tax? "It depends on what you're comparing against," said Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. If you are comparing it to the rate this year, then yes, it would be a tax increase. But if you compare it to where the rate was set to go next year, it's actually a tax cut. "Given that there was never any law passed to permanently make the tax disappear entirely," Williams said, "it's hard to argue that it's a tax increase relative to what otherwise would have happened." People often weigh a tax change relative to today's reality. So in that sense, it could be considered a tax increase compared to the anomaly of 2010. But the compromise tax plan is actually considered by many a win for Republicans, because the estate tax would have automatically jumped much higher -- to 55 percent on the value of estates over $1 million -- if no deal were reached. And it's less than the 45 percent rate on the value of estates over $3.5 million in effect in 2009 and which House Democrats proposed to make permanent last year. So we rate DeMint's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12357	"The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote" in the 2016 presidential election.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-mostly-false-claim-photo-id-voter/	While reflecting on the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton was asked why she didn’t campaign more in Wisconsin -- a state that hadn’t gone Republican since 1984, but one she lost to Donald Trump. Appearing May 31, 2017 at a conference in California sponsored by the Vox Media site Recode, Clinton replied by saying "we thought we were doing really well in Wisconsin," but that "our information was not as reliable as I wished it had been." Then the former Democratic nominee pivoted to another issue, contending that Wisconsin’s law requiring photo identification to vote caused voter suppression. "The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote," she said. "I don’t think we believed at the time, before the election, that it would be anything like that, anything as big as that." Clinton’s claim is similar to one by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., that we rated Mostly False. (The Washington Post Fact Checker later gave Baldwin three Pinocchios for the claim.) Baldwin’s claim Baldwin flatly stated that turnout in Wisconsin "was reduced by approximately 200,000 votes because of" the photo ID requirement. The 2016 contest was the first presidential election in which the law was in effect. Baldwin cited a May 2017 report commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama. When we contacted a spokesman at the Democratic National Committee, asking for information to support Clinton’s claim, he referred us to the same report. Comparing the 2012 and 2016 elections, the report said that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin. Had Wisconsin’s photo ID law not been in effect, the report argues, Wisconsin’s turnout would have been 200,000 votes higher, based on the average increase of 1.3 percent. Experts told us the methodology is lacking. Put simply: The voter ID requirement undoubtedly prevented or discouraged some individual people from voting. But the report attributes all of the lower turnout to the ID law, when there are many other reasons that could also explain it, including a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump, or perhaps a belief that Trump couldn’t win Wisconsin. Clinton’s statement isn’t as bold as Baldwin’s, in that she refers to an estimate. But that doesn’t change the fact that the methodology used to make that estimate, as we detailed in the Baldwin fact check, has been widely criticized. A final note from Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted that Trump earned almost the same number of votes in Wisconsin as did Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. "Clinton, in contrast, earned 238,000 fewer voters than did Obama," he said. "It would be a mistake to attribute essentially all of that decline to the voter ID requirement." Our rating Clinton said: "The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote" in the 2016 presidential election. A report three weeks earlier from a group that supports Democratic candidates says a decline in voter turnout between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections in Wisconsin was entirely due to the state’s new photo identification requirement for voting. But experts say that while photo ID requirements may reduce turnout to some extent, they question the methodology of the report and say there is no way to put a number on how many people in Wisconsin didn’t vote because of the ID requirement.

pomt-05835	Says Mitt Romney supports cap and trade.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/16/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-ad-says-mitt-romney-favors-cap-and-t/	Here’s the visual: Mitt Romney is armed and tearing through an empty warehouse, firing on his target, Rick Santorum. It's not the real Mitt Romney; it's a look-alike. Santorum is a cardboard cutout, and the ammo in the gun is mud. The Santorum campaign ad, "Rombo," is airing in Michigan ahead of the state’s presidential primary. Its message: Romney is attacking his rivals to mask his own record. "Romney and his super PAC have spent a staggering $20 million brutally attacking fellow Republicans. Why? Because Romney’s trying to hide from his big government Romneycare and his support for job-killing cap and trade." Here, we’re testing the claim that Romney supports cap-and-trade legislation to fight pollution. About cap and trade Cap and trade seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their caps are allowed to sell emission credits to other companies that need them. Republicans at one time praised cap and trade as a market-based environmental solution, but recently conservatives have taken to condemning it as an energy tax. Nowadays, you won’t hear Republican presidential candidates say anything but "no" to whether they favor it. They’re so eager to declare their opposition, the candidates at times have fudged their own records on the subject. Where Romney stands We didn’t hear back from the Santorum campaign when we asked for backup for this claim. Romney’s campaign sent us several of his past statements on cap and trade. In August 2011, speaking at a town hall in Lebanon, N.H., Romney emphasized the need for energy independence. "My focus as it comes to this topic is to get us off of our dependence on foreign oil, to use our natural gas, to drill for our oil, to use our coal, clean coal, to develop nuclear power, to use solar and wind and efficiency measures, that’s my priority. There are other people who would like to put in place a cap-and-trade program and dramatically increase the cost of energy. That’s their view. And by the way, that would kill a lot of jobs. And I don’t think it’s going to solve the problem of global warming." In October 2011, speaking at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Romney was asked directly whether he favors it. Here’s a portion of his answer: "I do not believe in a cap-and-trade program. By the way, they do not call it America warming, they call it global warming. So the idea of America spending massive amounts, trillions of dollars to somehow stop global warming is not a great idea. It loses jobs for Americans, and ultimately it won’t be successful, because industries that are energy-intensive will just get up and go somewhere else. So it doesn’t make any sense at all. My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us." That’s a slight change from some of his earlier statements about global warming, where he said he believes climate change is, at least in part, caused by human activity. "I believe that climate change is occurring – the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to man and how much is attributable to factors out of our control," Romney wrote in his 2010 book No Apology. Going back further, when Romney was governor of Massachusetts, he considered joining a regional cap-and-trade compact known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But when it came time to sign the deal, Romney backed out citing "a lack of economic safeguards," according to POLITICO. We think that’s good evidence that Romney once held at least cautious support for cap and trade. But the Massachusetts episode also shows that he withdrew his support when the policy was tested against economic considerations. Our ruling Santorum’s ad says a machine-gun wielding Romney is firing mud to hide his own support of "job-killing cap and trade." While Romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past, his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it. When he could have signed it into law, he declined. And more recently, Romney has repeatedly said he’s opposed to it. And when asked for evidence of Romney's support for cap and trade, the Santorum campaign failed to produce any. We rate the claim False. UPDATE, Feb. 22, 2012 After we published this story, a reader pointed us to an air pollution plan Romney proposed that was specific to Massachusetts power plants. It was separate from the regional compact that we noted in the original item. The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a "safety valve" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. "You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund," said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. "He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms." To Pizer, these carbon limits don’t fit the definition of cap and trade. "Maybe you’d call it the same family, but it’s different because you’re telling each source, ‘here’s what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs.’ This idea of trying to limit businesses’ exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade." We also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romney’s administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles’ opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations "fit the broad definition of cap and trade." But he added, "it’s in the eye of the beholder." We think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters. The new information adds some helpful details about Romney's position in the past. It is consistent with what we said in our original story, above, that Romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact. He has opposed it since, which is the basis for ruling Santorum's ad claim False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-02-16T17:55:55	2012-02-14	['None']

Rick Perry bemoaned a failure in Washington to confront Social Security's financial shakiness and praised three Texas counties that quit Social Security nearly 30 years ago.

Our Fight to Save America from Washington, Perry prefaces a reference to the Texas counties by saying Americans would fare better if they had the choice of making contributions to a private investment plan rather than Social Security. "Employees in those private plans, having exercised their liberty at Washington's sufferance, are reaping the benefits," Perry writes. A footnote points to an April 2005 article on Galveston County's experiences published by a conservative think tank, the National Center for Policy Analysis. That article, co-authored by Ray Holbrook, a former Galveston County judge, says Galveston's county employees "sought a secure, risk-free alternative to the Social Security system, and it has worked very well for nearly a quarter-century. Our retirees have prospered, and our working people have had the security of generous disability and accidental death benefits." According to the article, county employees committed to investing their payroll contributions in fixed-rate guaranteed annuities rather than fluctuating stocks, bonds or mutual funds. The result: Annual rates of return of 6.5 percent averaged over 24 years, the article says, plus substantially better benefits in three Social Security pay-out categories: retirement, survivorship and disability. "To be sure, our plan wasn't perfect, and we have made some adjustments," the article says. "For instance, a few of our retired county workers are critical of the plan today because they say they are making less money than they would have on Social Security. This is because our plan allowed workers to make 'hardship' withdrawals from the retirement plan during their working years. Some workers withdrew funds for current financial problems and consequently robbed their own future benefits. We closed that option (in January 2005)." We learned from Rick Gornto, the certified financial planner who helped start and still oversees the alternate plans, that plan participants can take their accumulated earnings in a lump sum or in regular installments once they retire. "They do have an opportunity to take it out and squander it," Gornto said, adding that the lump-sum option might be eliminated in the future. Gornto said the reason that hasn't happened yet is that the annuities began as a supplement to county employees' primary retirement program -- fixed payments through pension plans managed by the Texas County and District Retirement System, which is based in Austin. Perry didn't mention this plan in his book or on CNN. Gornto said the safety net of the county and district retirement plan made it possible to design the alternate plan with its lump-sum feature. If the other pension plan wasn't in place, Gornto said, he probably would have proposed a plan without a lump-sum feature and offering regular post-retirement payments along with the leeway to invest earnings. The 2005 article mentions 1999 reviews of the Galveston plan by the U.S. General Accounting Office and the Social Security Administration. We turned to them next. Among points the agencies raised: +Low-paid workers stood to get less in monthly retirement payments under the alternate plan than they would under Social Security. In response, the 2005 article says the studies assumed a low 4 percent return on the plans' annuities; actual returns have been substantially higher. +Workers with higher earnings and fewer or no dependents who qualify for Social Security generally fare better under the Galveston plan, particularly in the near term, but workers with lower earnings and more dependents tend to receive more money under Social Security, the report says. +Galveston's retirement funds are invested at the county's discretion and employees do not control investment decisions. During 1981-97, annual interest earned on the plan's fixed annuity contracts averaged an inflation-adjusted 4.62 percent. During the period, annual interest earned on Social Security's investments averaged 4.88 percent, the administration report says. On the plus side, the GAO review notes: "The alternate plans' benefits are fully funded, while Social Security's promised benefits cannot be met without increasing program revenues." Finally, we chased up-to-date information per the Texas plans' health. The county treasurers for Brazoria and Matagorda counties, Amy Perez and Sharon Reynolds, respectively, told us their plans work well. Like a Galveston County official, Perez and Reynolds suggested we gather particulars from Gornto. Gornto said in an interview that a key to the alternate plans' appeal is their guaranteed annual return, now at least 3.75 percent. He added that unlike Social Security, which needs changes to remain financially viable in the long term, the counties' plans don't confront a money-gone date: "We don't have an 'out-year' question issue because people put their money in, they match it, and whatever it grows to is what they get." He said up-front contributions to the plans will remain stable so long as the counties don't go broke, while pay-outs to beneficiaries are certain unless the United States completely devalues its currency. "The money will be there," Gornto said. Gornto forwarded a summary of his firm's review of the Galveston County plan for October 2008 through September 2009. In an interview, he noted that by the end of that year, the plan had $54.1 million available to be paid employees in deferred (or retirement) compensation. Employees and the county combined pitched in about $6 million in payroll contributions through the year. "The county has adopted this program to replace Social Security," Gornto said. "Until they make a decision to disband the plan, it will always be there." For outside expertise, we talked to Keith Brainard, who's the research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. After reviewing the materials Gornto shared with us, Brainard explained that the alternate plan is a defined-contribution plan, similar to a 401k plan, in which benefits are determined solely based on contributions and investment earnings. "By definition, the plan is always fully funded because the plan pays out only as much as it collects," Brainard said in an e-mail. That said, Brainard wrote, the plan lacks three features that are part of Social Security: a minimum benefit for lower-income workers; protection from inflation; and required annuitization, meaning that participants must receive at least some of their benefit as a lifetime income stream, rather than as a single lump-sum. On the other hand, he said, the long-term cost of the Texas plan is clear and certain. Also, unlike Social Security, plan participants own their retirement assets, rather than being entitled only to a monthly benefit for the remainder of their lives. The basic difference between the Texas plan and Social Security, Brainard said, is that the Texas plan is a "retirement savings plan that provides benefits based on contributions and investment performance, while Social Security is an insurance plan intended chiefly to prevent stark poverty in old age. Social Security promises a certain level of benefits based on salary and other factors, with a minimum benefit for lower-income workers and a maximum for higher-income workers. Both plans present relative advantages and disadvantages, and an argument could be made for providing elements of both plan types for all working Americans." And how does Perry's statement fare? Far as we can tell, the alternate plans are healthy and should remain so. But the Texas plans serve employees also eligible, depending on years of service, for the Austin-based pension plan. Perry's larger point, that Americans stand to benefit from swapping out Social Security for alternate plans, doesn't acknowledge this pre-existing safety net in the Texas counties.

pomt-06993	Says U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is responsible for "over $14 trillion in debt."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/11/jim-demint/sen-jim-demint-says-sen-sherrod-brown-responsible-/	Josh Mandel, who was elected Ohio treasurer last November, insists he’s not officially running for the U.S. Senate. But the young Republican, whose two tours in Iraq as a Marine intelligence specialist and his fund-raising prowess has made him a top GOP political recruit, is raising money and collecting endorsements like an official candidate. He won two endorsements recently that come with fund-raising help, one from the conservative Club for Growth and one from the Senate Conservatives Fund. The Senate Conservatives Fund, headed by U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, said in a statement that the group was "launching an all out SCF surge to raise $100,000" for Mandel by June 30. Explaining his support of Mandel, DeMint heaped praise on Mandel while blasting Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, whose seat Mandel wants. "The race will pit a young conservative leader with the principles and determination to restore America’s greatness against a liberal career politician who is responsible for near double-digit unemployment and over $14 trillion in debt," DeMint said in a statement. DeMint’s statement was widely distributed by the group and others, including the Cuyahoga County Republican Party, and quoted by news organizations, including The Columbus Dispatch. Politifact Ohio tripped over DeMint’s line that Brown is responsible for the country’s $14 trillion debt and decided to ask DeMint to explain Brown’s culpability. DeMint’s spokesman, Wesley Denton, referred our questions to the Senate Conservatives Fund. The funds’ spokesman, Matt Hoskins, said in an email that Brown has voted for bills that drove up spending and the debt, citing his support for the financial and auto bailouts, federal stimulus bill and the health care reform bill. He also said that Brown has voted for other Democratic spending bills and earmarks and has voted to raise the debt ceiling at least three times. Before we can get into DeMint’s defense, let’s review a few things about the debt. The debt is the total amount of money the government has borrowed over the years to cover its cash deficits. The government has often carried debt, which spiked after recessions and wars. In the past, however, the government has done a better job of paying down those debts. When Republican George W. Bush left the presidency in January 2009, the nation’s debt was $10.6 trillion, which includes the amount of publicly held debt plus debt held by the U.S. government. The government borrows from itself by tapping the money set aside to pay for Social Security and other entitlement programs. Under President Obama, the debt has climbed to more than $14 trillion. Since 2001, Congress has voted to raise the legal limit of borrowing, known as the debt ceiling, 10 times, seven under Bush and three times under Obama, according to the Congressional Research Service. Congress faces a vote on raising the debt ceiling in August. If Congress doesn’t raise it, the government will default on its loans, which is fueling the debate over cutting and spending issues. Brown, a former representative nearing the end of his first term in the U.S. Senate, has been in Washington nearly 19 years. And he’s voted to raise the debt ceiling in the past, but he’s also voted against raising the debt ceiling three times. So, does Brown bear the responsibility for the debt, as DeMint claims? Hoskins acknowledged that Brown is not solely responsible for the debt but said Brown’s still a major cause. "DeMint says many Republicans are responsible, too," Hoskins said. "But Sherrod Brown has clearly contributed greatly to the problem. Has there ever been a spending bill that he didn’t support?" In other words, DeMint is saying any vote Brown cast that resulted in federal expenditures has contributed to the national debt. But there’s numerous problems with this argument. For one, it paves the way for the reverse argument that any vote Brown cast against spending or reducing revenue should be tallied and subtracted from the national debt. Brown, for instance, voted against the Bush-era tax cuts, which the non-partisan Congressional Research Service said came with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion. (But Brown supported a 2010 bill that extended them for two years and renewed jobless benefits.) Brown also voted against the War in Iraq, which the CRS says cost $800 billion in direct costs to date. Brown – despite claims to the contrary by the Senate Conservatives Fund -- also voted against the 2003 Medicare prescription drug program passed by the Republican-controlled Congress. At the time, President Bush said the program would cost $400 billion but the figure was later revised to more than $1 trillion. In a recent PolitiFact item, Brian Riedl, the lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argued that kind of tallying was faulty analysis. Riedl referred us to his own blog, in which he wrote, "Imagine a basketball team that loses 100-98. It would make no sense to cherry pick one single basket by their opponent and blame it for 100 percent of the loss – letting all other baskets scored off the hook." Riedl’s broader point is that "one could cherry pick" any number of spending or tax policies and blame them for the entire problem. Trying to assign a value to every individual vote leads to an accounting exercise that would give a CPA nightmares. The biggest problem with DeMint’s argument is that it oversimplifies how Washington works by ignoring that spending agendas are set by party leadership and succeed only when leaders win collective support. The argument also ignores the impact of recessions and wars, and all the other spending and borrowing that produces debt. So where does this leave DeMint’s original claim? Right off the bat, DeMint – through a spokesman at the Senate Conservatives Fund -- admits that Brown is not singularly responsible. DeMint’s attempt to assign a value to Brown’s vote sets up an accounting exercise in a vacuum, leaving out important details and context. And Hoskins in emails to Politifact Ohio incorrectly claimed Brown supported the Medicare prescription drug program that passed in 2003. DeMint’s comment also selectively ignores a Washington reality: No one politician alone can take credit for blowing the budget because the fiscal policies by both parties have shaped the government overspending since 2001. Brown has certainly voted for spending programs and to raise the debt ceiling, but DeMint left himself little wiggle room in a statement designed to score political points. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates False.	None	Jim DeMint	None	None	None	2011-07-11T06:00:00	2011-06-27	['United_States']
pomt-12930	Tuberculosis recently passed "HIV/AIDS as the leading infectious killer globally."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2017/jan/11/nick-seymour/tuberculosis-might-top-hivaids-deadliest-infectiou/	Among nations, the United States is the runaway leader in the money it spends on global health programs, and the looming question for advocates is what will happen under President Donald Trump and a Republican Congress. Nick Seymour, a Harvard junior volunteering at a health clinic in Mexico, argued for sustained spending. "One would be hard-pressed to find a policy issue that has a greater impact on more lives than global health financing, yet the topic has not broken through the white noise of the election and post-election coverage," Seymour wrote in a Jan. 7 op-ed published in The Hill. Seymour underscored the many millions of HIV/AIDS patients helped by American dollars, and noted a disturbing trend with tuberculosis. "Tuberculosis’ recent surpassing of HIV/AIDS as the leading infectious killer globally has not been met with anything close to equal funding for relief," he wrote. We’ve looked at TB’s death toll before; it is a wickedly tenacious disease. The data question is, has it really become a bigger killer than HIV/AIDS? And looking at the data, the estimates are mixed. But just as importantly, the relative death tolls of the two diseases has more to do with success in treating HIV/AIDS patients, and less to do with any change in the spread of TB. Seymour told us he relied on figures from the United Nations and World Health Organization. For 2015, they estimated 1.1 million people died from HIV/AIDS. In the same year, TB deaths reached 1.4 million, jumping 300,000 from just a year before. The rise inspired headlines that tuberculosis was now the leading cause of death from infectious disease. And within the framework of that UN data, that was accurate. But there is another widely used and well regarded overview of global health. It is the Global Burden of Disease study, produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and published by the British medical journal Lancet. By their calculations, TB deaths in 2015 totalled 1.1 million and HIV/AIDS deaths 1.2 million. But as institute researchers Hmwe Kyu and Theo Vos, told us, you couldn’t actually say that one topped the other. "We didn’t find any statistically significant difference between the number of deaths due to both diseases," they said. An imperfect science: The India factor Estimating deaths from TB and HIV/AIDS requires judgment calls. As the WHO’s TB report noted in its methodology section, "There are many potential sources of uncertainty associated with estimates of TB incidence, prevalence and mortality." Many poorer, more rural nations have a hard time collecting the data from doctors and clinics. Faced with missing numbers, analysts make assumptions to fill in the gaps. Then they run the country totals through overall statistical models that involve other assumptions. Usually, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the WHO roughly agree at the global level. But in 2015, there was a 300,000 death difference for TB. That was also the first year when new numbers from India began to change the WHO’s global estimates. Prudence Smith, a WHO spokeswoman, told us in October that between 2013 and 2015, India shifted from a reporting system based on paper to one that lives on the Internet. "In addition," Smith said, " the country has made case notification legally mandatory." In the world of tuberculosis, India is a huge deal. It is home to more than 25 percent of all TB cases and deaths worldwide. With more raw data in hand, the WHO’s estimate of the TB death toll in India more than doubled, going from 220,000 in 2014 to 480,000 in 2015, a jump of 260,000. To be clear, it’s not that more people were dying from TB, just that India reported more deaths to the WHO. Curiously, in the same period, the institute’s estimate for India barely changed. It had judged the figure to be in the neighborhood of 480,000 since 2013. The WHO’s upward shift for India accounted for 80 percent of the rise in its global total for TB. The institute had no reason for such an adjustment. It had factored in a higher number for India all along and it's global total remained about the same. Why TB might overtake HIV/AIDS (without even trying) Most people hearing that TB deaths now outnumber HIV/AIDS deaths, or had simply pulled even with HIV/AIDS, would likely think that TB was spreading. That would be wrong. Beyond the matter of better reporting out of India and a couple of other countries, the real driver behind the shifting numbers has to do with HIV/AIDS. "We have been much more successful in the fight against AIDS than TB," said Audrey Jackson, a senior global health fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. (Jackson just published a report on the many ways TB programs have played second fiddle inside Washington.) Death rates for both TB and HIV/AIDS have been falling, but the decline has been faster for HIV/AIDS than TB. Using the institute's data, between 2005 and 2015, the death rate for HIV/AIDS globally fell by 42 percent. At the same time, the TB death rate fell by about 34 percent. This chart from the institute’s database shows the impact on the number of deaths. The gains against HIV/AIDS have a lot to do with a massive hike in the number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment. There has also been a rise in the number of people getting treated for TB, but according to researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, in many countries, it’s proven harder to spot patients with TB. That leads to delays in care, which in turn make it harder for the person to beat the disease. Couple that with the rise in antibiotic resistant TB, along with other factors, and the gains are slower compared to HIV/AIDS. Those trends cast TB as more of a growing threat than HIV/AIDS. Right now, the death rates are about the same. However, Hmwe Kyu at the institute said that if the trend lines continue, then the victims of TB will outnumber those of HIV/AIDS. Not because TB has become worse, but because the situation with HIV/AIDS got better faster. Our ruling Seymour said tuberculosis is now a bigger killer than HIV/AIDS. Numbers from the United Nations and the World Health Organization support that, but another equally credible source, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said the death tolls are about the same. The data’s not good enough for highly precise estimates. It’s also unclear that TB is killing more people than it did before. The higher estimate by the WHO reflects better reporting, mainly from India, but not more actual deaths. The one undisputed point is that death rates are falling faster for HIV/AIDS than for TB. Both sets of data back that up. In that respect, TB is the more threatening infectious disease because the world is having a harder time getting ahead of it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the TB threat is itself rising. It looms larger than HIV/AIDS because that threat has fallen.

Clinton is right in her broader point that Obama's plan does not include a mandate for people to have health insurance, as hers does. He believes his plan would lower health care costs enough that most of the 47 million Americans without coverage would be able to find a plan they could afford. But with no mandate, some people would inevitably go without coverage. But how many? Clinton says 15 million; health care experts it's impossible to come up with a reliable number without more details on Obama's plan. Clinton's 15 million number could be a reasonable estimate -- it's 30 percent of those currently without insurance -- but it's at best a guess. For that we reason, we rate her claim half true.

pomt-12832	Says Republicans are "organizing to take people’s health care away."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/08/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-republicans-are-organizing-take-peop/	Does the GOP want to take away your health care? That’s what U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, claimed in a Jan. 6, 2017 interview with Wisconsin Public Television. Republicans, Baldwin said, are "organizing to take people’s health care away." Asked for backup, a Baldwin spokesperson said the senator’s comment was in reference to plans from congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare after former President Barack Obama, who played a key role in crafting the law. It’s no secret that many in the GOP have long opposed Obamacare and have campaigned on promises to dismantle it. Indeed, there has been some recent action to that end: In January, the House and Senate took preliminary steps to abolish the ACA and about a week later President Donald Trump directed federal agencies to limit its reach. But leading Republicans have also said they intend to enact replacement legislation still aimed at providing people with health coverage. How does that all square with Baldwin’s statement that Republicans are "organizing to take people’s health care away." Let’s take a look. Repeal and replace Baldwin’s statement posits that Republican intervention will result in people losing access to health care, an assumption that is supported by some evidence. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported in January 2017 — after Baldwin made the claim — that 18 million people would be uninsured within a year if key portions of the law were repealed. The office further projected that number would grow to 32 million people by 2026. But there’s more to the story. The congressional report was exclusively focused on the impact of abolishing Obamacare and did not consider replacement legislation. Moreover, prominent Republicans have repeatedly said they would seek to replace the law with an alternative: • Days after he was elected in November, Trump said the ACA "will be repealed and replaced." He later told The Washington Post in January: "We’re going to have insurance for everybody." • U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, has said that his goal is "to give everyone access to affordable insurance." A white paper Ryan’s office released in June 2015 also said that House Republicans aimed to "provide all Americans with health care that is accessible, affordable and sustainable." The plan includes two popular features of the Affordable Care Act: covering people with pre-existing conditions and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plan until age 26. • Baldwin’s Wisconsin counterpart, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Oshkosh, told public radio in January 2017: "Nobody here wants to pull out the rug from under people, leave them high and dry without access to quality health care. It's a goal we all share. We should concentrate on that. Everybody wants every American to have access to affordable and quality health care." Republicans have yet to fully devise and agree on a replacement to Obamacare, although in January a pair of GOP senators introduced one alternative measure. The legislation would essentially let states keep using the ACA if they want; develop a new alternative system that would be eligible for some federal funding; or opt against any federal aid. Still, Baldwin’s claim is not supported by what congressional Republicans have said and done thus far. Our rating Baldwin said that Republicans are "organizing to take people's health care away." While the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that repeal of the Affordable Care Act could result in millions of people losing their health insurance, that finding did not examine the effect of any replacement legislation. Prominent congressional Republicans — and Trump — have repeatedly said they intend to propose alternative legislation that would aim to give all people access to health care. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate Baldwin’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-05603	Says you need a photo ID to purchase Sudafed in Texas.	true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/28/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-photo-id-required-purchase-sudafed/	Defending the blocked Texas law requiring voters to present photo IDs at the polls, Gov. Rick Perry pointed out that similar identification is already required for some activities. In an interview with Fox News on March 16, 2012, Perry told anchor Bill Hemmer: "It goes without saying that in today’s world, having a photo ID -- whether it’s to get on an airplane, or whether it’s to cash a check or whether it’s to check a library book out -- is pretty standard fare." Hemmer interjected: "Well, you need a photo ID in New York to buy Sudafed." Chuckling, Perry replied: "And I might add, in Texas too." The issue was raised a few days after the U.S. Department of Justice concluded that a Texas mandate that voters present photo IDs could prevent thousands of Hispanic Texas voters from casting ballots — thus violating federal voting-rights laws. According to a March 12, 2012, Associated Press news article, the government’s objection means the Texas law, which Perry signed in 2011, cannot be enforced unless a federal court in Washington clears the way. An aside: Perry may have overstated the hurdle for library books. In December 2010, we rated Mostly False a similar claim by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst.after finding that libraries did not require photo IDs at checkout, though patrons of most libraries had to show a photo ID when applying for a library card. We burrowed in to see if it’s correct that Texas purchasers of Sudafed must present a photo ID. Sudafed, a decongestant, contains pseudoephedrine, which is a precursor drug to manufacturing illegal methamphetamines. A 2005 Texas law required pharmacies to make a person purchasing pills containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or nopseudoephedrine to display a driver's license or other ID containing the purchaser's photograph, as noted online by the Texas State Board of Pharmacy. A legislative summary of the proposal, offering the measure’s rationale, said that in 2000, the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse reported that 1,821 people were admitted into Texas treatment centers for methamphetamine abuse; as of 2004, that number had risen to 11,238. So, case closed? Pretty much, Gay Dodson, executive director of the state pharmacy board, told us, and she pointed out by email that a federal act, also approved in 2005, includes a photo ID requirement. According to information on a Department of Justice web page, the federal law requires customers purchasing products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine to show a photo ID issued by a state or federal government. If the purchaser lacks such an ID, other types may be used, such as a U.S. passport, certain unexpired foreign passports, a school ID card with a photograph or voter registration card, among alternatives. The Texas law requires a business making an over-the-counter sale of a product containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or norpseudoephedrine to make the purchaser show a driver’s license or other form of photo ID that indicates the person is 16 or older. Dodson noted, too, that legislators in 2011 amended the law to specify that the presented IDs must be government-issued. Upshot: Perry’s Sudafed statement reflects both state and federal ID requirements. It’s True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2012-03-28T18:28:40	2012-03-16	['Texas']
pomt-05412	"We have to recognize that our salaries for faculty are the lowest in New England with the exception of the University of Maine."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/03/david-dooley/university-rhode-island-president-david-dooley-say/	When Governor Chafee objected to 3-percent raises for faculty at the University of Rhode Island and other state colleges last month, his action raised questions about how much professors are paid for their work. In an appearance last month on "10 News Conference," URI President David Dooley was asked about the controversy. "We have to recognize that our salaries for faculty are the lowest in New England with the exception of the University of Maine," he said on the show, which aired April 8. "That’s a competitive disadvantage for us in the national and international hunt for talent. Our students will not be as successful if we don’t have the best and brightest in those classrooms." We wondered whether URI’s salaries are really that low relative to other public higher education institutions. If they are, Dooley’s contention that the salaries make URI less attractive to prospective faculty members makes sense. While waiting for the university’s media relations department to get back to us on the source of Dooley’s claim, we searched for information and data. The Chronicle of Higher Education, a news source about colleges and universities, maintains a salary database on its website based on annual surveys by the American Association of University Professors, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. The AAUP’s most recent survey, for the 2011-12 fiscal year, collected salary information for 1,251 higher education institutions around the country. The survey broke down the average salaries by position: full professor, associate professor, assistant professor, and, where applicable, instructor. According to the survey, the national average for full professors is $113,176; for associate professors, it’s $78,565; for assistant professors, $66,564; and instructors, $47,847. At the University of Rhode Island, the average for full professors is $105,200; for associate professors, it’s $78,900; for assistant professors, the number is $65,800; and for instructors, it’s $58,600. To be clear, in his statement, Dooley was comparing URI with the other flagship state universities in New England. This is a small group that excludes private institutions and smaller public colleges, such as Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island. Besides URI, the list includes the University of Connecticut, the University of Massachusetts system, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Vermont and the University of Maine. According to the Chronicle database, UConn, the four UMass campuses and the University of Vermont all had higher average salaries for each teaching level than URI. The University of Maine’s average salaries were all lower. Data for the University of New Hampshire was missing from the 2011-12 survey. A spokeswoman for the AAUP told us UNH did not respond to a request for salary information. When we called UNH, a spokeswoman said the faculty union may not have provided the information because it’s in the midst of a contract dispute with the university and is working under the terms of an expired contract. Erika Mantz, director of media relations, gave us the current average salaries for UNH faculty. In summary, these are the average salaries for full professors at each institution in order from highest to lowest: UConn ($139,100), UMass Amherst ($122,600), UMass Lowell ($120,100), UNH ($115,800), UMass Boston ($115,700), UMass Dartmouth ($111,200), the University of Vermont ($113,800), URI ($105,200) and the University of Maine ($95,000). So URI does indeed rank second from the bottom in the region. And for each of the other categories, it occupies the same place. When David Lavallee, a spokesman for URI, got back to us, he provided data that the provost’s office took from the 2010-11 AAUP salary survey. We confirmed that in that year, URI also had the second-lowest average salaries in New England. Our ruling Dooley said that faculty salaries at URI are the lowest among public universities in New England except for the University of Maine. According to a national survey, he’s correct. Moreover, although salaries for lower-level faculty at URI are comparable to national averages or better, salaries for full professors are 7 percent lower than the national average. We rate Dooley’s statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-08555	"Twice as much (federal) money is going back to Hawaii, Virginia and Alaska than is coming home to Oregon."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/30/jim-huffman/jim-huffman-blames-ron-wyden-not-getting-more-fede/	In his underdog bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Republican Jim Huffman has consistently railed against the senior senator for spending too much taxpayer money, in particular for voting for the $787 billion federal stimulus package approved by Congress last year. So it seemed a little strange when Huffman issued a statement accusing Wyden of failing to bring home the federal bacon. The Sept. 2, 2010, press release is headlined "Oregon draws short straw" and starts with the statement: "Oregonians watch as their tax dollars go into other states." In it, Huffman cites a U.S. Census Bureau report that shows Oregon fifth from the bottom on federal money spent per person in the state. Huffman, a constitutional law professor at Lewis & Clark Law School, uses the report to show how Oregon was "all but forgotten" as the federal government spent $3.2 trillion last fiscal year. "It is insulting to Oregonians that Ron Wyden keeps voting for deficit spending despite knowing that twice as much money is going back to Hawaii, Virginia and Alaska than is coming home to Oregon." Intrigued by such passion, we were curious to find out if Huffman was accurately describing the gap between Oregon and those other states. Turns out the answer is yes -- but he’s also sweetly cherry picking the three states with the highest numbers. It is correct that those states get twice as much as Oregon, per person. Federal spending per person in Oregon is $8,800, according to the Census Bureau, compared with $19,000 in Hawaii, $19,700 in Virginia and $20,350 in Alaska. (It’s worth noting that those states have major military installations. Oregon does not.) Still, his underlying point is correct. Oregon falls short of the $10,400 U.S. average per person. The state ranks 46 of 50 states for federal money per capita, although you should keep in mind that two dozen states are crowded in the $8,000 to $10,000 bracket and 17 clustered in the $10,000 to $12,000 bracket. Oregon is a "donor" state. In 2005, the state received 93 cents in federal spending for every $1 sent to D.C. in taxes. California and Washington also are donor states. The last time Oregon received $1 for every $1 sent to D.C. was in 1988, when it ranked 29th among states in taxes paid to the federal government and 39th in the amount of spending received, according to the Taxpayer Foundation. That’s also when former Sen. Mark Hatfield chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee, the pork farm of Congress. Still, we wanted to know whether Huffman thought it OK to spend money Congress doesn’t have -- also known as deficit spending -- if more of the dollars come to Oregon. Huffman campaign manager Amilyn Gordon said Huffman doesn’t like overspending and he doesn’t like the idea of sending pet projects to Oregon. But Gordon said it’s more than fair to point out that Oregon is tops in unemployment and in the bottom in dollars from Congress. "Here’s just another example of how Oregon is drawing the short straw," she said. Huffman is right that Oregon lags behind other states, but he stretches his point by singling out the three highest states for comparison and by saying that Oregon was "all but forgotten." This claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-06969	"Numerous studies have shown that these so-called right-to-work laws do not generate jobs and economic growth."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/15/sheila-oliver/new-jersey-assembly-speaker-sheila-oliver-says-stu/	A pair of Republicans in the state Assembly recently introduced a bill that would make New Jersey the 23rd state where workers can opt against joining a union, setting off a debate over the economic impact of so-called "right-to-work" laws. Assemblywoman Amy Handlin (R-Monmouth/Middlesex), one of the bill’s sponsors, had claimed the move "would quicken New Jersey’s economic revival." But Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex/Passaic) said the legislation was "dead on arrival." In a July 8 press release, Oliver explained how right-to-work laws represent bad economic policy. "Numerous studies have shown that these so-called right-to-work laws do not generate jobs and economic growth," Oliver said in the press release. "In fact, these laws have been found to suppress wages and have had no impact on employment and business growth." After looking at the research and talking to economic experts, PolitiFact New Jersey ended up with a mixed picture of the impact of right-to-work laws. Some experts argue that the influence of that single policy is difficult to pin down, but others said there is a connection between job creation and right-to-work laws. First, let’s talk about job growth in those right-to-work states. Patrick Semmens, a spokesman for the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, pointed out that right-to-work states are producing jobs at a faster rate than other states. A recent ruling from PolitiFact Georgia confirmed that trend. Handlin argued that higher personal income and lower unemployment rates are examples of right-to-work leading to job growth. Semmens and Handlin both referred to the research done by Ohio University economics professor Richard Vedder. Vedder told us right-to-work laws were associated with job creation. Even accounting for other factors, right-to-work laws produce positive economic outcomes, he wrote in an email. Yet some right-to-work states have no state income tax, which could make the relationship between right-to-work laws and income growth seem like a "mirage," Vedder wrote. Vedder acknowledged how job growth is greater in right-to-work states, but added "that showing a statistical relationship does not necessarily imply causation." So, are right-to-work laws the reason for the job growth in those states? Oliver’s spokesman, Tom Hester Jr., sent us an April study from the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, that supports the assemblywoman’s argument. That study claims that since both sets of states "can foster booming job markets, then something in these states’ economies, demographics, or policies other than RTW must be driving their growth." Roland Zullo, a research scientist in labor and economic studies at the University of Michigan, said there’s no convincing research proving a link between right-to-work laws and job growth or decline. Other factors, such as tax packages, could explain what’s driving companies to right-to-work states, Zullo said. Another recent study by two economics professors reached a mixed conclusion on the subject. In terms of manufacturing employment, a right-to-work law had no significant impact in Oklahoma, but another right-to-work law increased the number of jobs in Idaho, according to an email from those professors, Serkan Ozbeklik and Ozkan Eren. Right-to-work laws likely create jobs, but part of the job growth is probably the result of other business-friendly policies in right-to-work states, according to Ozbeklik and Eren. W. Robert Reed, an economics professor in New Zealand, who had researched right-to-work laws while working in Oklahoma, wrote in a series of emails that right-to-work laws create jobs and increase wages. Right-to-work limits the ability of unions to negotiate benefits to the point of discouraging companies from hiring new employees, Reed wrote. But Reed noted, as Vedder did earlier, that "correlation does not prove causation." "Did wages grow faster in RTW states because of RTW legislation? Or because of other factors? That's virtually impossible to determine," Reed wrote. "So many other factors could also have been responsible for job and wage growth in those states." It’s worth noting that the research is also divided on whether right-to-work laws reduce workers’ wages, as Oliver suggested. Two studies from the Economic Policy Institute suggest workers in right-to-work states earn less than their counterparts in other states. Ozbeklik and Eren found that right-to-work led to reduced non-union wages in the private sector in Oklahoma. But Reed argued in a 2003 study that average wages are higher in right-to-work states, when factoring in state economic conditions at the time the right-to-work laws were adopted. Let’s review: Oliver claimed that studies show "right-to-work laws do not generate jobs and economic growth." According to different studies and economic experts, the evidence is mixed that right-to-work laws spur job growth. Right-to-work states have seen greater job increases, but one economist pointed out that such a dynamic doesn’t prove right-to-work laws were the cause. Another professor who believes job growth results from right-to-work laws acknowledged that many other factors also could be responsible. We rate Oliver’s statement Half True.

pomt-08505	Dan Webster "would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/07/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-dan-webster-would-force-rape-and/	In his new toned-down version of the "Taliban Dan" attack ad, Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., one of the most outspoken Democrats in the House, narrows his focus to three points. The first ad, released Sept. 25, 2010, garnered mostly negative attention for labeling his Republican challenger, former state House Speaker Daniel Webster, "Taliban Dan." PolitiFact Florida looked at Webster's longstanding connection to a conservative Christian group and ruled one part of that ad False and another part Half True. On Oct. 6, 2010, the Grayson camp released a new ad that covers much of the same territory, but which eliminates some of the more provocative language and claims from the first ad. As soon as we heard about the new ad, we knew we had to fact-check all the claims. Here's a full transcript of the new ad: Daniel Webster's Washington backers are attacking Alan Grayson on women's issues. The facts on Webster's record: Fact: Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships. Fact: Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home. Fact: Webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child. Those are the facts. Don't let Daniel Webster make the laws we will have to live with. Here are our fact-checks for the first of those claims (True) and for the second (Barely True). The one we'll check now is the claim that Webster "would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child." First, we tried to confirm Webster's position on abortion. His campaign website has a section titled "Sanctity of Life" that says, "Daniel Webster would support legislation that the Constitutional protections of life and liberty extend to the unborn." He also earned the most stringent anti-abortion rating (and an endorsement) from the Republican National Coalition for Life -- "pro-life without discrimination." And we saw a 1996 St. Petersburg Times profile that reported that Webster "opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest." We checked with his campaign to confirm whether he is opposed to abortion even in cases of rape and incest, and a spokeswoman confirmed it. So Grayson's ad is correct on Webster's philosophical beliefs about abortion. But does that mean that Webster "would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child"? We don't think that's so clear-cut, since Webster's legislative efforts on abortion, while extensive, have stopped well short of what Grayson's ad suggests. Webster's legislative record is extensive, having served 28 consecutive years representing the Orlando area. He was elected to the state House in 1980 and was re-elected until 1998. He then served in the state Senate from 1998-2008. From 1997-1998 he served as House speaker, the first Republican to hold that position since 1875. There is no question that Webster was a consistent opponent of abortion throughout his career in Tallahassee. Webster earned a 100 percent "A" rating from the Christian Coalition of Florida his last four years in the state Senate -- one of only two to receive a perfect rating each year. In 1988, Webster sponsored a law requiring parental consent for some abortions by minors. The law passed, but ultimately was ruled unconstitutional. As speaker in 1997, he helped pass two bills seeking to limit abortions. The first, the Woman's Right to Know Act, required doctors to give women seeking abortions special pamphlets explaining the procedure and listing alternatives. The second bill banned a controversial and rare type of late-term abortion. In 1998, he voted in favor of a parental notification bill. This bill was passed, but then vetoed. Meanwhile, in 2004, while serving in the state Senate, Webster proposed a bill that would create guardians for unborn children. The bill did not pass. In 2005, he helped author legislation that required parents be notified if their minor child was intending to get an abortion. This bill passed and was signed into law. And in 2008, his final year in elected office, Webster proposed a bill that would require women getting an abortion to first have an ultrasound of the fetus performed. That bill failed on a 20-20 vote in the Senate. (A similar bill passed this year, before being vetoed by Gov. Charlie Crist.) Two of these bills did not have exceptions for rape or incest victims, but we don't think they provide sufficient support for the ad's sweeping statement about Webster's intentions about rape and incest victims. The 1997 late-term abortion bill addressed a rare sub-segment of all abortions, while the 1998 parental notification bill affected minors only and provided them with the right to notify a judge instead of their parents. All told, this represents a lot of legislative activity on abortion. However, our review of Webster's time in the Legislature also uncovered a pattern of pragmatism. Most strikingly, in 2006, after South Dakota passed a sweeping abortion ban, Webster decided against attempting to enact a similar law in Florida. South Dakota's anti-abortion law banned abortion in all cases -- including rape or incest -- only allowing it in order to save the life of the mother. Webster said that the climate in Florida wasn't right for such a bill, particularly after the heated debate over whether the government should intervene in the case of Terri Schiavo, a brain-damaged woman who died after a feeding tube was removed at her husband's request. The Schiavo case became a cause celebre for opponents of abortion. "Based on the vote last year on the Terri Schiavo issue, it appears the the climate in the Florida Senate is not right for pro-life legislation," Webster said. Two years later, when he proposed the ultrasound legislation, Webster included exemptions for victims of rape, incest, domestic violence or human trafficking. "I'm pro-life, so I want to see as many people at least think as long as they can about it," Webster said during the 2008 ultrasound bill debate. "There's nothing I can do about changing the law. Abortions are going to be offered. But I'd like to at least give (women) the very best information." So where does this leave us? There is no question that Webster believes that abortion should be banned except to save the life of the mother, and that gives the Grayson campaign a lot of cover for its charge. But this fact doesn't support the ad's claim completely. By charging that Webster "would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child," the ad steps beyond the realm of a candidate's personal belief and into the realm of what they would actually do if elected to office. It's impossible to know precisely what abortion bills Webster would propose or support if he were to be elected to the U.S. House. We asked Webster's campaign how he would vote if a bill were to come up in Congress restricting abortion in cases of rape and incest, but he declined to answer the question because it is a "hypothetical." They added that of his thousands of votes in the legislature, Webster did not sponsor or vote for such a measure. A close examination of his legislative career suggests that his hard-line philosophy has been tempered by a more pragmatic streak at times. Most strikingly, when Webster was faced with a 2006 South Dakota model that would do pretty much what Grayson said Webster would support, Webster declined to forge ahead, even as some abortion opponents urged such an effort. The Grayson camp discounts this example, saying it's only natural for a politician to advance his philosophy when the time is right and hold back when it's not expedient. They have a point. Still, Grayson's charge has a substantial grounding in the truth, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2010-10-07T16:12:54	2010-10-06	['None']
pomt-11651	In 2011 under Scott Walker, Wisconsin for the first time spent "more on our prison system than we did" on the University of Wisconsin System.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/12/kelda-helen-roys/ahead-2018-election-gov-scott-walker-attacked-spen/	The dais was crowded at a candidates’ forum attended by 12 of the Wisconsin Democrats who are running for governor in 2018. One of them joked that "there's actually another blank name tag up here, so if anybody else wants to get in the race ..." But much of the event, in Eau Claire on Dec. 11, 2017, was serious, of course. Candidate Kelda Helen Roys used part of her time to attack Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who is running for a third term. Roys, a former state Assembly member from Madison, accused Walker of putting prisons ahead of the University of Wisconsin System, saying: I think in 2011, it was Walker’s first budget, and we had the dubious distinction of spending -- for the first time in our state’s history -- more on our prison system that we did on the entire UW System. It’s a claim likely to be repeated during the campaign, so let’s check it out. Journal Sentinel report Walker was elected in 2010; his first state budget was for 2011-’13. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in 2012, that two-year budget allotted, for the first time, more money for prisons and correctional facilities -- that is, for the Department of Corrections -- than for the UW System. The tallies, after a $250 million cut to the UW System: $2.25 billion: Corrections $2.1 billion: UW System The operations of the Department of Corrections include running 36 adult prisons and correctional facilities, supervising adult offenders who are probation or parole, and managing the state’s two juvenile correctional facilities and community services for juvenile offenders. The UW System has 13 four-year campuses, including the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison, 13 two-year campuses (known as the UW Colleges) and a statewide extension with offices in each county. The Journal Sentinel’s report, which reviewed more than 20 years of Wisconsin state budgets, pointed out that the eclipse in funding between the two agencies was the culmination of years of policy changes made under both Republican and Democratic governors prior to Walker. Also, nationwide, public universities were seeing cuts while prison spending, sparked by sentencing changes put in motion in the 1980s, was going up. So, the change did occur on Walker’s watch, though it was the culmination of a shift over a period of years. More numbers For a little more context, we reviewed all four of the state budgets that have been adopted under Walker and the four adopted previously, all of which were under Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat. The figures are from the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. (We’ve indicated in bold whether the UW System or Corrections got more in each budget.) State budget UW System Corrections 2003-’05 $1.91 billion $1.7 billion 2005-’07 $1.93 billion $1.8 billion 2007-’09 $2.24 billion $2.17 billion 2009-’11 $2.27 billion $2.25 billion 2011-’13 (First Walker budget) $2.1 billion $2.25 billion 2013-’15 $2.25 billion $2.32 billion 2015-’17 $2.08 billion $2.35 billion* 2017-’19 $2.14 billion $2.43 billion* *Includes what is known as youth aids funding, to be consistent with prior budgets The figures show that in the four budgets before Walker, the gap in funding between the UW System and Corrections got smaller in each biennium; and since Walker, Corrections has gotten more money than the UW System. To be clear, those figures are for state tax dollars only. Corrections is essentially funded entirely with state tax dollars; in contrast, the UW System gets total funding of about $12 billion per year, much of it from federal grants and tuition payments. One thing that has squeezed the UW System is that, although the increases in its state funding slowed under Doyle, tuition was increased. In contrast, state funding for the UW System has remained roughly the same under Walker, but he has frozen tuition. A spokesman in the governor’s office didn’t dispute Roys’ claim directly, but said that under Walker the state is now spending more state tax dollars on higher education overall -- including the UW System, the technical college system and other funds -- than it did in 2011. Our rating Roys said that in 2011 under Walker, Wisconsin for the first time spent "more on our prison system than we did" on the University of Wisconsin System. She’s correct. That occurred with Walker’s first state budget, for 2011-’13, when he directed more state taxpayer dollars to the Department of Corrections than the UW System. But the eclipse was years in the making before Walker took office, and it’s worth noting that the UW System, with tuition and federal grants, has a much larger total budget than Corrections. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True. Editor's note: We revised this item on Jan. 12, 2018 to indicate that the governor's office did respond to our request for information. The response had been inadvertently overlooked when this fact check was first posted.

pomt-04342	"The sequester is not something that I've proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/24/barack-obama/obama-says-congress-owns-sequestration-cuts/	In their final debate before the election, President Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney each said they would be the staunchest supporter of the military. Said Romney: "I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts. That, in my view, is making ... our future less certain and less secure." Obama responded by saying Romney was assigning blame in the wrong place. "First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed. It is something that Congress has proposed. It will not happen," Obama said. "The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending. It is maintaining it." Was Obama right that he didn’t propose sequestration and that Congress did? The story goes back to the debt limit debate of 2011, so let’s start there. Looking for a budget deal in 2011 Last year, the United States government was reaching its legal debt limit, which meant Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing. Raising the debt limit (also called the debt ceiling) was in some ways symbolic: Congress has the power of the purse, and the decisions to spend the money had already been made. In prior administrations, Congress approved higher debt limits with some partisan sniping (including from then-Sen. Obama against President George W. Bush) but without too much fuss. But in the summer of 2011, House Republicans insisted that actual spending cuts go along with an increase to the debt limit. House Speaker John Boehner led negotiations with the Obama White House, and at first the two sides seemed to be moving toward a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget, referred to in the media as a "grand bargain." The closed-door negotiations fell apart, though, and since then journalists have been sorting through a lot of finger-pointing. Some blame Boehner for being unable to deliver his own Republicans on a deal, thanks to tea party opposition to any new taxes. Others blame Obama for his inexperience, for not cultivating relationships with congressional Republicans and for tactical mistakes at negotiating. Some blame both sides. At any rate, Republicans and Democrats came to a less ambitious agreement to raise the debt limit through the Budget Control Act of 2011. The law found approximately $1.2 trillion in budget cuts spread over 10 years. But it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion through a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which came to be known as "the super-committee." The super-committee was supposed to meet and agree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 23, 2011. Their proposal -- which could include tax increases, spending reductions or both -- would then get a filibuster-proof, up-or-down vote in Congress. As an incentive to the super-committee, the law included an unusual kind of budget threat: If the super-committee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted it down, then automatic, across-the-board cuts would go into effect, with half of those cuts hitting defense. These automatic cuts are referred to as "sequestration." A story in USA Today referred to sequestration as "the trigger mechanism on a budget bomb." Lo and behold, the super-committee didn’t agree on a deficit reduction package, so Congress never voted on it. Sequestration is now set to take effect with the 2013 budget. Whose sequester? In the debate, Obama said he didn’t propose sequestration, Congress did. (We asked the White House for comment, but didn't hear back.) To determine the question of ownership, we turned to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward’s new book The Price of Politics. Woodward’s reporting shows clearly that defense sequestration was an idea that came out of Obama’s White House. But the intention was to force Republicans to negotiate, not to actually put the cuts into effect. Woodward summarizes the thoughts of the Obama team: "There would be no chance the Republicans would want to pull the trigger and allow the sequester to force massive cuts to Defense." Democrats, meanwhile, didn’t want to see their favorite domestic programs cut. As the negotiations proceeded, Republicans seemed to think the same thing. "Boehner told the House Republican leadership and other key members not to worry about the sequester … ‘Guys, this would be devastating to Defense,’ he said. ‘This would be devastating, from their perspective, on their domestic priorities. This is never going to happen,’" Woodward wrote. Nonetheless, sequestration is now looming. We recently looked at a Romney campaign ad that blamed Obama for the sequester and talked to several experts about who is more responsible for the looming cuts -- Congress or the president. Some say that the Obama White House proposed sequestration, so that means Obama owns it. "While both parties are culpable for sequestration because the Budget Control Act passed Congress, the president proposed it originally and ultimately owns its outcome," said Mackenzie Eaglen, an expert on defense with the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an adviser to the Romney campaign. "That is because he alone can lead by calling the party leaders together for a resolution today if he wanted as president." Other see the two parties as co-owners of sequestration, especially since Republicans in Congress voted for the law that set up its possibility. In the House, 174 Republicans and 95 Democrats voted for the law, while 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 269-161.) In the Senate, 28 Republicans and 45 Democrats voted for it, while 19 Republicans and 6 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 74-26) "The logic that lays the blame for sequestration at Obama's feet, because he negotiated the BCA with GOP leaders in Congress, could just as easily apply to those other negotiators, or, indeed, any member of Congress who voted for the BCA in August 2011," said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Preble favors reductions to the defense budget. "I do not believe it accurate to refer to the cuts that will occur in both defense and non-defense discretionary spending under sequestration as ‘Obama's cuts,’" he said. Woodward, after Monday’s debate, reiterated what he said in his book -- and that Obama was off the mark in the debate. "What the president said is not correct," Woodward told POLITICO. "He’s mistaken. And it’s refuted by the people who work for him." Our ruling Obama said that the sequester -- and the defense cuts that would result from it -- was not his proposition. "It is something that Congress has proposed," he said in the debate. But it was Obama’s negotiating team that came up with the idea for defense cuts in 2011, though they were intended to prod Congress to come up with a better deal for reining in the deficit, not as an effort to make those cuts reality. Meanwhile, members of both parties in Congress voted for the legislation that set up the possibility of sequestration. Obama’s position is that Congress should now act to avoid those across-the-board cuts. Obama can’t rightly say the sequester isn’t his, but he did need cooperation from Congress to get to this point.

pomt-01840	"We are accepting more legal immigrants than we ever have in the history (of the United States.)"	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/16/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-we-are-accepting-more-legal-immigran/	The country’s focus is trained on headlines about illegal immigration. But a claim by former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum made us wonder about the other side of our immigration policy. What’s the trend for immigrants lawfully living in the United States? Santorum’s claim came up in a heated exchange with Detroit Free Press editorial page editor Stephen Henderson during the July 13, 2014, Meet the Press pundit panel. (We fact-checked another point from Santorum’s talking points, too.) "First off, we are accepting more legal immigrants than we ever have in the history ..." Santorum said before some crosstalk. "It's all chain immigration. And it's from the very countries that people have been coming from, because most of the immigration is tied to people who are already here." So is he right about the United States accepting more legal immigrants than ever? Like other immigration figures, there are a few ways to slice the data. In some ways, he is right. In others, he is not. We tried to ask Santorum which numbers he had in mind, but a spokeswoman for his group, Patriot Voices, could not be reached by email or Twitter. Experts directed us to the Department of Homeland Security’s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, which publishes annual numbers of people obtaining lawful permanent resident status, or a "green card," dating back to 1820 (see this chart for each year’s tally). Green card recipients exclude people who come to the country for short-term reasons, such as temporary work or studies. By the raw numbers The most obvious way to look at federal data is comparing raw numbers. The government admitted the highest amount of lawful permanent residents in 1991, at 1.827 million people, followed by 1990, at 1.536 million. Those years are higher than the most recent decade’s annual admissions, which hovered around the 1 million mark. The 2013 total is 990,553, down 4 percent from 2012. Those peak years -- 1990 and 1991 -- are atypical, the result of a swath of people receiving green cards after winding through the process laid out in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, said Sumption, Migration Policy Institute director of international research. (That was the last time Congress enacted sweeping immigration reform, FYI.) The third all-time highest year is 1907, with admissions of 1.285 million people. That tops the 2006 tally of 1.266 million people and any other recent year. Looking at individual years, however, may not be as useful as the slightly broader trend, Sumption said. From 2004 to 2013, average annual admissions were 1.076 million. During the other comparable time period of 1905-1914, before numerical quotes on immigration were in place, the average was 1.012 million people. That’s slightly lower than our most recent decade. But that doesn’t mean Santorum’s claim is in the clear. By percentage of population Perhaps an even better comparison would be legal immigrants admitted over time as a percentage of the American population, other experts told us. In that case, the influx of immigrants was more dramatic at the turn of the century, when the country’s population was much smaller. "Since the total population was 92 million in 1910, compared with 308 million in 2010, admitting more than 1 million immigrants in a single year (and this wasn't atypical of the decade) was much more significant," said Susan Martin, professor and director of Georgetown University’s Institute for the Study of International Immigration. Looking at the data in this light allows for analysis of the country’s capacity for bringing in new people without risking competition in the labor market, Sumption said. "Share of population is a better measure of the lived experience of immigration, the experience on the ground," she said. A big driver of the increase in recent years is the category for spouses of U.S. citizens, which isn’t too surprising considering the growing global economy and the fact that many people who come to the country for temporary purposes of work and study marry U.S. citizens, she said. Our ruling Santorum said, "we are accepting more legal immigrants than we ever have in the history" of the country. Over the last 10 years, in raw numbers, the United States has admitted slightly more immigrants into the country compared to any other 10-year period. But when you factor in the new arrivals as a share of the U.S. population, 1905-14 is the leading time period. And when looking just at raw numbers, the United States admitted more immigrants in 1907, 1990 and 1991. In fact, the 2013 tally -- 990,553 -- would rank 20th all time. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2014-07-16T16:18:29	2014-07-13	['United_States']
pomt-00894	President Obama said "22 times" he could not authorize immigration reform by executive order.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/06/doug-collins/collins/	Members of the U.S. House voted Tuesday to fund the Department of Homeland Security through September. The vote was a blow to a GOP-led threat to strike back at President Barack Obama for his executive action on immigration. All 10 Georgia Republicans voted "No" on the funding bill, which passed 257 to 167. Some Republicans wanted to add provisions to the bill to gut the legal protections that the president, by executive order, called to provide to as many as five million illegal immigrants. But after threat of a partial agency shutdown created a backlash, House Speaker John Boehner and the majority quietly capitulated Tuesday. They passed a ''clean'' funding bill with no immigration provisions. U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, was among those who voiced frustration. "It’s not what I would like to see," Collins said. Why, Collins asked, was the president willing to jeopardize funding for the Department of Homeland Security for "a proposal that frankly he himself has said 22 times he couldn’t do?" Sound familiar? It’s a claim PolitiFact has checked more than once and one that Republicans have repeated multiple times. The 22 citations were included in a blog posted by Boehner’s office in November and shared with us this week by Brendan Thomas, Collins’ spokesman. On Nov. 20, Obama announced he would delay deportations of illegal immigrants who have lived in the country more than five years, have children who are citizens or who have green cards. This would allow more than 4 million people to qualify for work permits and avoid deportation for three years, provided they each pass a background check and pay a fee. The president’s decision, which the GOP has denounced as an abuse of power, is on hold based on a temporary injunction from a federal judge in Texas. Our PolitiFact Texas colleagues checked the list for claims by politicians from that state. All of the citations in Boehner’s post were compared by PolitiFact Texas to transcripts and news stories. The majority of the examples are of Obama saying he did not have power to do more on immigration without Congress. Others, as we’ll explain in a moment, say something more nuanced or aren’t specific to immigration. We won’t go through every quote that supports Boehner’s point here, but here are a few we culled from a document created by PolitiFact Texas: In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that "as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do… we’re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally," as in parents deported. (No. 13 on Boehner’s list.) At a presidential debate in October 2012, Obama and Mitt Romney were asked: "What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?" Obama said: "I've done everything that I can on my own." (No. 14 on Boehner’s list.) In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn’t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had served law-abiding students. "I’m not a king," Obama replied, akin to his response the same month to a similar query from Univision. "You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And-- you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws-- we’ve got some discretion. We can prioritize-- what we do. But we can’t simply ignore the law." (No. 16 on Boehner’s list.) So clearly there are examples of Obama saying he couldn’t do more with executive action, then later doing exactly that. That’s why PolitiFact previously rated Obama’s claim that "my position hasn’t changed" as False. What should not be counted Also included on the list of 22 are quotes where Obama was either suggesting his executive powers did not have hard limits or was silent on his executive power on immigration. Here are a few problems with quotes included on Boehner’s list. In two instances during his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama criticized "signing statements" used by President George W. Bush that interpret laws, but he did not bring up immigration. Immigration was also not part of his reply to a question at a 2010 MTV/BET event when he said, "I can’t simply ignore laws that are out there," in response to a question about "don’t ask, don’t tell." (Nos. 1, 2 and 5.) In September 2011, with his deferred-action plan on the horizon, Obama reiterated that he cannot just change laws unilaterally in response to a question about possible administrative relief for students who don’t have legal residency. But he hinted that there might be room within his authority, saying, "what we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources." (No. 12 on Boehner’s list.) Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a New York immigration attorney, reviewed the GOP citations for PolitiFact Georgia and concluded a number referred to "deferred action,’ which, he said, ‘is not changing the law. "It is simply prioritizing who should be targeted for deportation, for example serious criminals," he said. "... most legal scholars believe that these executive actions fall within the limits; they do not exceed them." Kennesaw State University political science chair Kerwin Swint said the 22 statements "do indicate the president felt, at the time, that immigration authority should go through Congress. ‘But, funny how circumstances change change one's principles," Swint said. ‘When his party lost control of the Senate in 2014, he felt like he had no other choice but to use executive authority." Our ruling Collins said this: President Obama said "22 times" he could not authorize immigration reform by executive order. Obama did say that more than a dozen times. Other times it was something more nuanced or not specific to immigration. The broader point -- that Obama said one thing about executive action but did another -- is accurate. We rate Collins’ statement as Mostly True.	None	Doug Collins	None	None	None	2015-03-06T00:00:00	2015-03-03	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-04910	"One out of every two kids who are graduating college right now can't find a job."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/02/republican-jewish-coalition/republican-jewish-coalition-says-half-recent-colle/	The Republican Jewish Coalition recently launched a $6.5 million series of ads targeting voters who have "buyers remorse" about voting for President Barack Obama in 2008. Florida will be seeing these ads in heavy rotation: About a quarter of the ad spending is being earmarked for the Sunshine State, which is home to a large population of Jewish senior citizens whose support is highly sought after by both political parties. One of the ads features comments by Michael Goldstein, who is identified on screen as a "Democrat. Jewish. Voted for Obama." Goldstein criticizes several aspects of Obama’s presidency, including several concerns about his policy toward the Middle East. But Goldstein also takes on Obama’s economic record. At one point, Goldstein said that "one out of every two kids who are graduating college right now can't find a job." We wondered if that was correct, so we looked into it. We reached out to the coalition, but they did not get back to us. However, we found some research that we believe was the source of the comment. It was an article by the Associated Press that got wide play when it hit the wires on April 22, 2012. The headline, at least in some publications, was, "In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed." The article is based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs. Here’s how the AP summarized the findings: "A weak labor market already has left half of young college graduates either jobless or underemployed in positions that don't fully use their skills and knowledge. Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs – waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example – and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans. ... "About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed. … Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year." Upon reading this, we concluded that the speaker in the ad had garbled the statistic a bit. Rather than roughly half of recent college grads not being able to find a job, the reality is that about 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren’t commensurate with their degree. Of this 50 percent figure, about half are unemployed and about half are in jobs that don’t require a college degree. To make sure our interpretation was correct, we checked with Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research. Sum agreed with our analysis and said "the numbers being cited in the ad are not correct." The ad would have been more accurate if the claim had been phrased this way: "One out of every two kids who are graduating college right now can't find a job or can’t find one that requires a college degree." We also think there’s an additional piece of context worth mentioning. Viewers shouldn’t compare this 50 percent rate to the more familiar unemployment rate, which is currently at 8.5 percent. The reality is that even in strong economic times, a sizable percentage of recent college grads is either unemployed or employed in jobs below their abilities. According to the AP, the record low was still pretty high at 41 percent, in 2000 -- "before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and (information technology) fields." That’s far higher than the more familiar unemployment statistic for the overall population ever gets. Still, there’s reason to be concerned about the current rate: At 53.6 percent, it’s the highest it’s been in at least 11 years. Our ruling The ad claims that "one out of every two kids who are graduating college right now can't find a job." That’s not quite right -- according to Sum’s research, about a quarter of recent college grads literally can’t find a job, while another quarter have found a job, but one that doesn’t require a college degree. Still, the actual statistic does support the ad’s point -- that the employment picture for college grads is grimmer than at any time in more than a decade. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-08864	"The Congressional Budget Office estimates that for every $1 we spend on unemployment benefits, $1.90 is put into our economy."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/05/james-langevin/langevin-says-each-dollar-spent-unemployment-benef/	We all know that unemployment benefits help people in need, but most of us don't think of them as a boost to the economy. After all, it costs the government money to cut those checks, and it's not obvious how that expense comes back to benefit taxpayers. So it caught our attention when U.S. Rep. James Langevin declared during an online chat on ProJo.com that the economy reaps big benefits for every dollar paid out in unemployment benefits. "Extending these benefits not only helps those who are in difficult straits because they lost jobs through no fault of their own, but it is also one of the best ways to stimulate our economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that for every $1 we spend on unemployment benefits, $1.90 is put into our economy," he said. Unemployment benefits turn every dollar into $1.90? It's not Rumpelstiltskinesque, but even Wall Street scam artist Bernie Madoff wasn't promising that kind of investment return. Hoping to find a way to tap into this grow-your-bankroll phenomenon without risking jail time, we started asking questions. Our first stop was the source cited by Langevin, the January 2010 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office called "Policies for Increasing Economic Growth and Employment in 2010 and 2011." It looked at a variety of strategies for increasing employment and raising the gross domestic product (GDP), which is the market value of all goods and services that reach the consumer. That's where we discovered that Langevin wasn't telling the full story. The $1.90 figure is the budget office's high estimate. The report includes a much lower estimate as well: 70 cents. If it cost us $1 to add only 70 cents to the GDP, does that mean we risk losing 30 cents for every dollar we spend on unemployment? As we discovered from talking to a couple of economists, that's not what the numbers mean and spending money on unemployment benefits in the current economic situation isn't as dumb as the numbers might look to those of us who struggle to balance our checkbooks. Here's why. When you give $1 to people who have lost their jobs and they have run out of savings, those dollars get spent. So Mary gives it to Mike down the street to buy some of his fruits and vegetables. Mike, who relies on customers like Mary, might put 25 cents in the bank but use the rest to buy seed and fertilizer from Tom's store in town. Tom might save a dime of the 75 cents he got from Mike but use the remaining 60 cents for a new pair of glasses. When economists calculate the gross domestic product, they add up all those transactions (excluding the amount set aside in savings and money that ends up overseas if you buy foreign goods). In this limited example, Mary's $1 has added $2.35 ($1 plus 75 cents plus 60 cents) to the gross domestic product. Yes, it's still just $1, but by passing it along it has helped three people. This may seem like a strange way of looking at things until you imagine the opposite situation, where the economy goes bad and we stop paying unemployment benefits. When Mary can't afford to buy anything, Mike loses business, which affects his ability to pay Tom. As the impact ripples through the economy on a larger scale, unemployment spreads. Tax revenues evaporate. Governments must cut services, raise taxes and/or borrow money. That can mean more unemployment, less non-tax money for people to spend and higher government debt, like the kind you would incur if you decided to pay more unemployment benefits. The Congressional Budget Office report looked at a variety of strategies to boost the economy -- or to keep things from getting worse -- such as investing in infrastructure, reducing income taxes in 2011 or cutting payroll taxes for companies that hire new people. Increasing aid to the unemployed offered the biggest bang for the buck, according to its estimates. David Weil, a professor of economics at Brown University who explained the CBO numbers to us, stressed that this isn't always a good idea. It doesn't work when the economy is robust and unemployment is low. "If the CBO re-ran this analysis at a boom time, those numbers would be much smaller and they might be zero," he said, "and spending all that money would give you inflation and not higher output." The strategy works best when the people who are receiving the unemployment checks have to spend every government dollar they receive, and spend it on things that help underemployed workers and underutilized factories. That keeps the system flowing. It's true that the government has to borrow money (adding to the national debt) to make this work, Weil said. "Someday your kids or grandkids are going to be paying back that debt. We don't know whether it's going to look like the 1950s and '60s, when we grew out of the debt from World War II in a relatively painless fashion, or whether it's going to look like Greece." All of this is not without controversy. Other economists have their doubts about the ability to reliably gauge this so-called "multiplier effect," doubts that PolitiFact.com discussed when it examined a similar statement by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Nonetheless, the idea of converting $1 into $1.90 worth of economic growth, especially over the six-year period from 2010 through 2015, isn't as completely magical or illogical as it might seem. But, as with most things economic, there's a lot of uncertainty in the estimated benefit, an uncertainty that Langevin didn't convey. His spokeswoman, Joy Fox, said, "I would change his statement going forward to 'up to $1.90' or 'between 70 cents and $1.90 goes back into the economy.' " She also cited other studies where economists have offered very specific numbers that are closer to the $1.90 CBO estimate. For example, Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics and a former adviser to John McCain during his 2008 presidential run, puts the benefit at $1.61. We're always wary of numbers that sound very precise when a lot of estimates and assumptions go into generating them. Langevin should be too, which is why, for the sake of full disclosure, we wish he had given voters a better sense that $1.90 was just the highest estimated benefit for every $1 that is being spent on their behalf. So the Truth-O-Meter gives him a Half True.	None	James Langevin	None	None	None	2010-08-05T00:01:00	2010-07-12	['None']
pomt-08893	Justice Antonin Scalia agreed for the Supreme Court to hear a case about whether Barack Obama is eligible to be President.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/30/chain-email/e-mail-claims-supreme-court-agreed-rule-obamas-cit/	Despite overwhelming evidence that Barack Obama is a natural born citizen of the United States and eligible to be president, there are still plenty of people out there who believe that President Obama is a fraud. One of our loyal readers forwarded us a chain e-mail with several claims that we just couldn't pass up. In the chain e-mail is an article titled "Very Quietly Obama's Citizenship Case Reaches the Supreme Court." You would think this would have been big enough news that we would have heard about it, but this "article" has a dateline of April 1 (hint, April Fool's Day) and is also credited to the the Associated Press. In the article, the headline is further expanded upon, "Under growing pressure from several groups, Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments concerning Obama's legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey." You heard about this, right? For a plethora of reasons, we didn't expect that this was a legitimate AP article, but we decided to check with them anyway. It is not, according to Jack Stokes, an AP spokesperson. Still, maybe, somehow, this forged article contains some factual information? Leo Donofrio, a lawyer from New Jersey, did sue New Jersey Secretary of State Nina Wells in an attempt to block the election of Barack Obama. Donofrio claimed that since Obama's father was a British citizen, Obama was granted dual citizenship at birth and therefore was not eligible to be elected President. The case was submitted to the Supreme Court, but the court did not agree to hear it. The first tidbit that tipped us off was that the e-mail said Justice Scalia announced that the court agreed to hear arguments. That's not how it works. In order for the Supreme Court to hear a case, at least four justices have to be in favor of hearing it. At that point they issue a "writ of certiorari,'' colloquially reffered to as "cert." However, an individual justice doesn't make such an announcement. Such information typically comes from the court's public information office. Donofrio's case first went to Justice Souter, who denied the request. At that point it got bounced to Clarence Thomas, who submitted the case to committee. Just because Thomas sent the case to committee does not necessarily mean he supported hearing it, only that he thought it was worth it for the court to consider hearing the case. The court denied "cert" for Donofrio's case and that was the end of it. Still we wondered if the case had any legitimacy. This is an extremely misleading chain e-mail. First, it is not an Associated Press article, despite posing as one. Second, an individual justice would not speak for the court when agreeing to hear a case. Third, the case was, in fact, denied cert by the court. It's a ridiculous and misleading claim, so we give it a Pants On Fire.

pomt-07007	"This governor has cut funding repeatedly for people who have AIDS, who need drugs to save their life."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/08/herb-conaway/assemblyman-herb-conaway-jr-claims-gov-chris-chris/	Wearing pink shirts and holding up signs, people gathered outside the Statehouse in Trenton recently as Democratic legislators led a rally to increase women’s health care funding in the face of opposition from Gov. Chris Christie. When Assemblyman Herb Conaway Jr. (D-Burlington/Camden) addressed the crowd on June 20, he claimed Christie also has been cutting health care funding for another group: people with AIDS. "This governor has cut funding repeatedly for people who have AIDS, who need drugs to save their life," said Conaway, a physician specializing in internal medicine. "People who have AIDS today can live out their life...almost as long as anybody else if they get the drugs they need and this governor, time and time again, has cut that." PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that the Christie administration had cut or proposed to cut state funding for AIDS and HIV services, but in two cases, other funding sources would allow the same number of individuals receiving those services to be served. When we asked Conaway’s chief of staff, Ethan Hasbrouck, to back up the statement, he pointed to two funding cuts in the governor’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 as well as a change made last year in eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. Although a final budget for fiscal year 2012 was approved at the end of June, this Truth-O-Meter item focuses on the proposed budget at the time of Conaway’s statement. We later called Hasbrouck twice and sent him multiple emails to set up an interview with Conaway about our findings, but we never heard back. Let’s review those three items one at a time. Hasbrouck said the fiscal year 2011 budget lowered the income eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. That disqualified about 960 people from the program, saving $7.9 million. But the state later set up a new drug benefits program to assist those individuals who would no longer be eligible under the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. That new program was funded through additional rebates from pharmaceutical companies and a new federal grant program. The state increased AIDS Drug Distribution Program funding last year for people who met the new income eligibility, but reduced spending in other categories of HIV services, according to Dawn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services. Now, let’s turn to the cuts in the originally proposed fiscal year 2012 budget. Hasbrouck correctly states that the governor’s proposed budget would have cut $4.7 million for special-care nursing facilities, including Broadway House in Newark, the state’s only long-term care facility for people living with HIV and AIDS. The second proposed cut cited by Hasbrouck was $3.7 million from the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. Although that state funding was proposed to be cut, the mix of funding sources would enable the same amount of participants to receive access to medications through both the AIDS Drug Distribution Program and the other drug benefits program, according to Thomas. But remember this: two of the funding cuts cited by Hasbrouck were only proposals at the time of the assemblyman’s statement. Here’s how the final budget for fiscal year 2012 affects AIDS and HIV funding: The income eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program was restored to its previous level, but state funding for the program has been further reduced for a total cut of about $10.7 million, Thomas wrote in an email. Other funding sources will allow the same number of participants to be served, she wrote. The budget reduces overall funding for nursing facilities, but there is no longer a specific cut to special-care nursing facilities like Broadway House, Thomas wrote. The impact on those special-care facilities remains unclear, she wrote. Let’s review: Conaway claimed at a Statehouse rally that Christie has repeatedly cut AIDS funding. His chief of staff pointed to three pieces of evidence, one from the budget approved last year and two from the proposed budget for fiscal year 2012. A spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services confirmed cuts to AIDS and HIV funding in both budgets. But last year, a new program was created to assist people impacted by the eligibility change. This year, state funding was proposed to be cut, but other funding sources were to maintain services for participants. Conaway correctly stated that Christie has cut state funding for AIDS and HIV programs, but at least when it comes to pharmaceutical assistance, people continued to receive medicine for their AIDS and HIV treatment. We rate his statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Herb Conaway Jr.	None	None	None	2011-07-08T05:15:00	2011-06-20	['HIV/AIDS']
pomt-04357	Says Tammy Baldwin introduced a bill that would require doctors and other health care workers to ask patients, "including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/23/glenn-grothman/gop-lawmaker-claims-senate-candidate-tammy-baldwin/	State Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, is among Wisconsin’s most blunt and outspoken lawmakers. So, when he weighed in on the U.S. Senate race -- claiming the federal government would force doctors to ask patients about their sexual orientation -- we decided to take a look. In a Sept. 28, 2012, news release, Grothman attacked the Democratic candidate, U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Madison, stating: "In 2010, Tammy Baldwin introduced H.R. 6109, which would require healthcare workers, including doctors, to ask patients at government-funded clinics, including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity." He pledged to sponsor state legislation to exempt Wisconsin minors from such a bill. Baldwin and her view In the news release, Grothman called Baldwin "obsessed with radical left-wing social causes" -- which dovetails with attacks made by Baldwin’s Republican opponent, former governor Tommy Thompson. Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus said Baldwin’s bill would have given the U.S. secretary of health and human services discretion on how to collect information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Questions would be added to surveys already being conducted and minors would not be questioned without parental consent, he said. "These are not doctors asking their patients questions," he said. So, those are the views of Grothman and Baldwin. Let’s take a closer look. The bill Baldwin introduced House Resolution 6109, the Health Data Collection Improvement Act, in September in 2010. The bill got little news coverage at the time, although a reader of the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram newspaper raised it in an online discussion after the first Thompson-Baldwin Senate debate in September 2012. Baldwin explained the reason for her bill in a statement when the bill was introduced, according to Washington Blade, a gay news publication: "Currently, the federal government does not collect any information about the health and well-being of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Americans. Consequently, our knowledge of the health of the LGBT community is drastically insufficient and our current health care system fails LGBT individuals on many levels." The bill was sent to the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The subcommittee approved an amendment by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., prohibiting the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity from minors without the consent of a parent or guardian. The subcommittee then voted, 12-10, to send the amended bill to the full committee, where it died. What would it have done? According to a summary by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, Baldwin’s measure would have required the health and human services secretary "to ensure that each HHS health service program or HHS health survey provides, to the extent the secretary determines appropriate and practicable, for the voluntary collection of data on the sexual orientation and gender identity of individuals who apply for or receive health services through such program, or who respond to such survey." That’s a mouthful. To break it down: The bill would have required the collection of data from individuals on their sexual orientation and gender identity. It would have been left to the U.S. health and human services secretary how to collect the data. Patient participation would have been voluntary. We discussed the bill with health policy experts from two Washington, D.C. research organizations: Kellan Baker of the liberal Center for American Progress, and Edmund Haislmaier of the conservative Heritage Foundation. They agreed that since Baldwin’s bill gave discretion to the health and human services secretary, it’s possible that doctors and other health care workers in certain clinics or other settings could have been required to ask patients about their sexual orientation and gender identity -- although that could have been through routine intake questionnaires rather than being asked to face to face. The experts also agreed that Baldwin’s bill would not have required doctors or other health care workers to ask patients about sexual orientation. Again, it would have been left to the HHS secretary to decide how to collect the data, and that might have been largely done through means such as anonymous telephone surveys that the agency already does. Grothman himself agreed, when we asked about his claim, that while the bill was written to be applied broadly, it would have been up to HHS to write regulations on how to collect the data. A final note: While Baldwin’s bill did not become law, the federal government is moving to collect such data in connection with President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, known to critics as "Obamacare." In June 2011, the Health and Human Services Department announced it would add questions on sexual orientation to its national data collection efforts by 2013. The department also announced it would begin a process to collect information on gender identity. Baker, of the Center for American Progress, said HHS is working on adding sexual orientation to its National Health Interview Survey, which is done randomly by telephone. Our rating Grothman said Baldwin introduced a bill to require doctors and other health care workers to ask patients, "including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity." There’s an element of truth in Grothman’s claim, in that the bill would have required a federal agency to collect such data. But there was no requirement that doctors or other health care workers question their patients. We rate Grothman’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-02053	"From the ‘Do As I Say Not As I Do’ department: federal employees owe $3.3 billion in back taxes."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/may/30/michael-sullivan/sullivan-claim-about-federal-workers-owing-taxes-p/	Conservative activist Michael Q. Sullivan stirred our interest with this May 23, 2014, tweet: "From the ‘Do As I Say Not As I Do’ department: federal employees owe $3.3 billion in back taxes." By email, the president and ceo of Empower Texans told us he drew his a-ha from an Associated Press news article, posted online May 22, 2014, which opened: "From workers in Congress and at the White House to active-duty troops, more than 318,000 federal employees and retirees owe just over $3.3 billion in back taxes, the Internal Revenue Service said." The described tally, effective as of Sept. 30, 2013, included 714 of about 17,000 U.S. Senate and House employees, according to IRS officials, though the data behind its report did not indicate whether members of Congress were delinquent on taxes, the AP reported. Its story said 36 of nearly 1,800 workers at the White House and its agencies owed taxes, though again there was no detailed breakdown. To our inquiry, a Washington, D.C.-based IRS spokesman, Bruce Friedland, emailed the relevant agency chart presenting the number of delinquent workers and retirees for about 100 federal agencies. According to the chart, that $3.3 billion owed was a slight decrease from the $3.38 billion owed by federal workers and retirees a year earlier. The share of delinquent workers and retirees inched up from 3.2 percent to nearly 3.3 percent of all people in those categories, based on 318,462 of nearly 9.8 million total retirees and employees, the chart says. Then again, federal workers and retirees appear to be less widely delinquent than taxpayers in general. The AP story said the IRS estimates at least 8.7 percent of all taxpayers are delinquent. Sullivan, nudged about this aspect, emailed: "So what?... Federal employees should owe zero." Our ruling Sullivan tweeted: "From the ‘Do As I Say Not As I Do’ department: federal employees owe $3.3 billion in back taxes." That dollar total is correct, though this message didn’t acknowledge that the 3-plus percent of delinquent federal employees and retirees compares to nearly 9 percent of taxpayers in general. Basically, fewer federal employees fail to pony up on time. We rate this claim, which lacks this clarifying information, as Mostly True.

pomt-05177	Says Barack "Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’ "	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/14/national-rifle-association/barack-obama-coming-after-guns-under-radar-nra-say/	President Barack Obama has shown little interest in peddling a gun control agenda during his first term, but the National Rifle Association is urging its members not to let its guard down ahead of the 2012 election. In a new mailer, forwarded to us by a reader, the gun rights group lists "Ten Reasons Why Obama is Bad for the Second Amendment." We’ve been exploring several claims on the list this week -- you can see our findings here. A crucial point to the don’t-sleep-on-Obama thinking comes in as reason No. 10 on the NRA list: "Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’" The quote and the claim struck us as interesting because 1.) It’s typically not smart to say you’re doing something "under the radar," if you’re actually doing something under the radar, and 2.) It suggests something of a conspiracy because Sarah Brady is a prominent gun control advocate, having helped create the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence with her husband Jim. (We’re assuming you know the Brady story, but if you don’t -- this will help.) We decided to check it out. While the NRA didn’t respond to our questions about the claim, we found the genesis of the Obama quote easy enough. It comes from a 2011 Washington Post profile of White House gun policy adviser Steve Croley. It’s not a direct quote from Obama, rather it’s Brady recalling to Post reporter Jason Horowitz her meeting with Obama on March 30, 2011, the 30th anniversary of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. Here’s what Horowitz wrote: During the meeting, President Obama dropped in and, according to Sarah Brady, brought up the issue of gun control, "to fill us in that it was very much on his agenda," she said. "I just want you to know that we are working on it," Brady recalled the president telling them. "We have to go through a few processes, but under the radar." In the meeting, she said, Obama discussed how records get into the system and what can be done about firearms retailers. Her husband specifically brought up the proposed ban on large magazine clips, and she noted that even former Vice President Dick Cheney had suggested that some restrictions on the clips might make sense. "He just laughed," Sarah Brady said approvingly of the president. Both she and her husband, she emphasized, had absolute confidence that the president was committed to regulation. The rest of the Post article focuses on how Democrats and the Obama administration have largely ignored gun control issues, how Obama has failed to deliver on a promise to eliminate an amendment requiring the FBI to destroy records of gun buyers’ background checks, and how Obama chose to avoid a debate over gun issues in the weeks and months after the shooting of Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. We contacted Post reporter Jason Horowitz, who declined to comment. To recap: The Washington Post reported that Sarah Brady said Obama told her his administration is "working on it," likely referring to gun control (in what way is unclear in the article). And Brady then tells the Post Obama said, "We have to go through a few processes, but under the radar." The quote then gets distorted by the NRA to "Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’" Although the wording leaves plenty of room for interpretation, it's not accurate to summarize that quote by saying "Obama admits he’s coming for our guns" because the specifics of Obama’s comment -- as relayed by Brady -- are unknown. We contacted Brady, who told us her quote has been misinterpreted and that she herself never spoke with Obama about gun policy. "I so remember (Jason) Horowitz -- he was at the press get-together in the briefing room after our meeting. (Her husband) Jim was asked lots of questions -- then (Horowitz) followed me as we walked out of the briefing room until he got back into the main part of the West Wing. He kept trying to pin me down -- asking what I thought -- I was trying to be evasive as I didn't want to paint Obama as with us or against us -- as we hadn't really talked about it. If I remember correctly, I just kept shaking my head and trying to get away from him. What ever I might have said or agreed to was purely speculative as I never spoke to the president myself about this issue." We also spoke with one of the few other people in the room during the meeting between the Bradys and Obama -- Paul Helmke, the former president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Helmke told us he did not recall Obama making any specific promises on gun issues, and that if Obama was talking about anything, it was likely a proposal to require gun shops in border states to report purchases of two or more of semi-automatic rifles if they were made within a five-day window by the same person. The federal proposal was first considered in December 2010, and went through a lengthy public comment process during the first six months of 2011. The rule was implemented in July, though it is being challenged in court by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Helmke said the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence had been discussing the proposal to better track multiple sales of semi-automatic rifles with the Department of Justice before meeting with the president. "I don't think (Obama) should be seen as referencing anything more than just requiring border-area gun dealers to report multiple sales of long guns," Helmke said. If that context is correct, Obama’s statements fall far short of what the NRA claims, namely that Obama is "coming for our guns." But even if Helmke is wrong, the NRA -- which did not respond to us -- has produced no evidence that the president is crafting a plot to take away firearms. Not through his policies. Or his words. On top of that, the context of the quote is being challenged by the person who gave it -- Brady. Our ruling In a mailer, the National Rifle Association says that "Obama admits he’s coming for our guns, telling Sarah Brady, ‘We are working on (gun control), but under the radar.’ " We found no evidence of an Obama admission anything like the NRA suggests. What happened is Brady gave an interview to the Washington Post, where she recalled what the president said to her during a private meeting. But the NRA makes a tremendous leap by concluding that the quote shows that "Obama admits he's coming for our guns." A person at the meeting said Obama was likely referring to an in-the-works program to get gun dealers in border states to forward some gun purchases to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Brady says she never talked to Obama about gun policy. The NRA has taken a fragment of an unclear quote and prescribed the most far-reaching, conspiratorial conclusion. There simply isn't enough evidence for such a sweeping claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2012-06-14T17:34:31	2012-06-11	['Barack_Obama', 'Sarah_Brady']
pomt-02472	The medical marijuana ballot initiative "doesn’t require a physician writing a prescription" and can be for conditions like "having a back that needs to be scratched."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/feb/21/don-gaetz/don-gaetz-says-doctors-wont-have-write-prescriptio/	As medical marijuana heads to the ballot in Florida in November, opponents like Senate President Don Gaetz have argued that it will be too easy for people who want to smoke pot recreationally to get their hands on it. "The ballot initiative is the legalization of marijuana," said Gaetz in an interview on Florida Face to Face on Feb. 13, 2014. "It doesn’t require a physician writing a prescription and it can be for purposes as specious as having a back that needs to be scratched. That’s the legalization of marijuana that I oppose and will vote against in November." We’ve already fact-checked claims about the initiative, and there’s some merit to the argument that people will be able to get medical marijuana for a wide variety of conditions. But Gaetz’s claim about physicians struck us as suspicious, so we decided to check it out. Would patients need a prescription? In a 4-3 ruling in late January, the Florida Supreme Court paved the way for the amendment about medical marijuana to appear on the November ballot. The ballot summary mentions doctors right off the bat: "Allows the medical use of marijuana for individuals with debilitating diseases as determined by a licensed Florida physician. Allows caregivers to assist patients’ medical use of marijuana. The Department of Health shall register and regulate centers that produce and distribute marijuana for medical purposes and shall issue identification cards to patients and caregivers. Applies only to Florida law. Does not authorize violations of federal law or any non-medical use, possession or production of marijuana." But if you read further into the amendment text, you’ll see that technically patients wouldn’t get a "prescription." Instead, patients will need a "physician certification," which the amendment text states means "a written document signed by a physician, stating that in the physician‘s professional opinion, the patient suffers from a debilitating medical condition, that the potential benefits of the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the health risks for the patient, and for how long the physician recommends the medical use of marijuana for the patient. A physician certification may only be provided after the physician has conducted a physical examination of the patient and a full assessment of the patient‘s medical history." Robert Mikos, a Vanderbilt law school professor who specializes in drug policy, told PolitiFact Florida that there is a fine distinction between a certification (or a recommendation, as it’s commonly called in other medical marijuana states) and a prescription. Doctors generally don’t "prescribe" marijuana, because in order for a physician to be allowed to prescribe narcotics, the doctor must register with the Drug Enforcement Agency. If the practitioner were to prescribe a Schedule I drug like marijuana -- which means under federal guidelines it is a dangerous narcotic, with no approved medical uses -- they would lose their registration, and would legally no longer be allowed to prescribe drugs. On the other hand, a 2002 federal court decision did find that a doctor could simply recommend the drug, protecting the discussion with their patient under First Amendment protections of freedom of speech. "In the legally relevant sense, it’s no different than a doctor recommending jogging every day," Mikos said. The certification in practice would largely be a piece of paper documenting the discussion, and would create a paper trail similar to a prescription, in order to track who is getting the drug and why. Once a patient gets that certification, the Department of Health will issue the patient an identification card, according to the ballot language. Under the Florida law, patients would not be able to grow their own plants. Approved patients could purchase marijuana from registered, state-regulated centers. If the amendment passes, the Department of Health will set rules for how centers will operate. What sort of conditions would be covered? The amendment text lists a number of qualifying conditions for medical marijuana, including cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDs, Hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. But as Gaetz’s spokeswoman Katie Betta noted, it also includes this language: "or other conditions for which a physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient." The Supreme Court, in allowing the amendment to go forward, noted that conditions that qualified would be those that "cause impaired strength, weakness or enfeeblement." We’ve previously noted that the ballot language suggests marijuana could be recommended for conditions like muscle spasms, neck pain, back pain and menstrual cramps, because all those conditions could be described as "debilitating." This means anyone who has a condition that weakens or enfeebles them could qualify to use marijuana if their physician indicated that their use of marijuana outweighed the potential health risks. That would include a wide range of ailments, and Gaetz’s spokesperson defended his choice of words on those grounds. "The president is making the point that the amendment is open-ended because it states that a physician can issue a certification allowing for the use of medical marijuana for any condition where the benefit could outweigh the risks. ..." Betta told PolitiFact in an email. "The Supreme Court’s ruling did not interpret the amendment for application and will not be bound by any interpretation that was advanced related to the ballot summary challenge." Still, Gaetz seems to be going too far using an example of "a back that needs to be scratched." Certainly, chronic itching can be a serious condition, but Gaetz's implication is that a condition with a simple remedy could be used to qualify for marijuana. The ballot language sets a higher bar than that, noting that the condition must be "debilitating." Our ruling Gaetz said the medical marijuana ballot initiative "doesn’t require a physician writing a prescription, and it can be for purposes as specious as a back that needs to be scratched." Because of federal law, doctors won’t be writing prescriptions. Instead they will write a certification after examining the patient, determining the patient would benefit from marijuana and how long the patient should use it. Gaetz’s statement suggests Floridians could get marijuana without a doctor being involved, but that’s not the case. Gaetz’s claim that someone can get marijuana for having a back in need of scratching is also misleading. The ballot language says that a condition must be debilitating, which means it weakens the person. While many different types of conditions could qualify under this definition, a back that simply needed scratching wouldn't qualify. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00308	Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, "we lost thousands of plants."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-has-point-NAFTA-shuttered/	How has the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, affected the number of manufacturing plants in the United States since its enactment in 1994? It’s been a big negative, President Donald Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity during an interview in Las Vegas. Trump, who has negotiated with both Canada and Mexico to replace the current agreement, told Hannity, "NAFTA was a disaster. We lost thousands of plants. We lost millions of jobs. NAFTA was a disaster." We take up Trump’s statement about job losses in a separate fact-check. Here, we’ll look at the question of plants that have been lost post-NAFTA. The United States saw a loss of more than 80,000 manufacturing establishments from 1994 through 2014. Data from a Census Bureau series, Business Dynamics Statistics, tallied 357,330 manufacturing establishments in 1994 and 274,756 in 2014, the last year for which data is available. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Granted, it’s unlikely that every shuttered manufacturing plant owes its closure to NAFTA. Among other things, advancements in technology have revolutionized manufacturing in recent years. But even if a small fraction of the closures stem at least in part from NAFTA, then Trump’s use of "thousands" is valid. Our ruling Trump said that since NAFTA, "we lost thousands of plants." That's actually an understatement. The United States lost 80,000 plants since then. Not all can be blamed on NAFTA, but even if only a fraction of them can be, Trump has a point. We rate the statement Mostly True. Editor's note, Sept. 24, 2018: PolitiFact has joined an effort with other North American fact-checkers to examine statements about trade and tariffs.

pomt-07659	Tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would immediately lower gasoline prices	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/mar/12/jeff-merkley/jeff-merkley-calls-obama-tap-strategic-petroleum-r/	Let’s take a moment to talk about SPR, since a lot of people in Washington -- including Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- are making it a topic of intense interest these days as gas prices soar. SPR, for those not versed in Washington-speak, is short-hand for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is the nation’s insurance policy against disruptions in the oil market and today holds 727 million barrels of oil dumped in underground caverns in Louisiana and Texas. It was created in 1975 in response to the economic (and political) turmoil inflicted by the Arab oil embargo and is intended to be soften supply disruptions the economic chaos they cause. There’s no dispute it’s a good idea. "During oil supply disruptions, releasing oil from the SPR could greatly reduce damage to the U.S. economy, based on our analyses and expert opinions," the Government Accountability Office said in a 2006 report. "Particularly when used in conjunction with reserves in other countries, the SPR can replace the oil lost in all but the most catastrophic oil disruption scenarios we considered, lasting from 3 months to 2 years." The discussion now focuses on two points: Should the reserve be used? If it is, what effect will it have on prices? Merkley expressed no doubt on either. In a March 4 letter to President Barack Obama, Merkley urged the president to use the reserve now. He is convinced it would bring down prices. As an added benefit, he said, revenue raised from selling the oil could be used to jump-start the development of electric cars. "This action would immediately lower gasoline prices, generating significant revenue to invest in your call for one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015," Merkley said. The letter was co-signed by Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Barbara Boxer of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and independent Bernard Sanders of Vermont. Obama said he is considering the step but has made no promises. At this news conference on March 11, he said: "Should the situation demand it, we are prepared to tap the significant stockpile of oil that we have in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve." But in response to a question he suggested that conditions haven’t reached the point yet where it should be used. "If we see significant disruptions or shifts in the market that are so disconcerting to people that we think a Strategic Petroleum Reserve release might be appropriate, then we'll take that step," he said. "And we're going to monitor very closely -- and obviously we have it teed up, so this isn’t a situation where it would take a big bureaucracy and several weeks for us to implement. This is something that would take several days." That point might arrive. With a potentially protracted civil war taking hold in Libya and rippling unrest across the Mideast, markets have gone crazy and the price of fuel has spiked. The possibility for disruption is real. Oil analysts, however, say for the time being any reduced flow from Libya can easily be covered by increases from other countries. The market seems to be missing that point. The price of gas in Portland has jumped to $3.60 a gallon now compared to $3.22 a month ago and $2.85 a year ago, according to AAA. Nationwide, it has jumped 40 cents a gallon in the last month and federal analysts predict the price could hit $4 a gallon by summer. Members of Congress, including Merkley, are demanding action to relieve the pressure on hard-hit constituents. But "immediately" is a pretty precise term. To the average person filling his car it also suggests more certainty than might be possible. Like so many words uttered in Washington, it has multiple meanings. But first, let’s look a some history. The petroleum reserve has been used twice before: In 2001 after the United States attacked Iraq and in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina dismantled the Gulf region, which is the center of the country’s oil infrastructure. And sure enough, when oil was released in 2005 prices fell 5.2 percent. In 2001 the drop was even more pronounced after 34 million barrels were released. Prices dropped 33 percent the next day and even six months later prices were 30 percent below the price before the war. In December 1990 gas was $1.34 a gallon and rising, reflecting the market's nervousness about Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. By Jan. 28, 1991, the price had dropped to $1.17 a gallon after President George H.W. Bush ordered 17 million barrels released from the reserve in advance of the U.S. attack. The pattern was repeated in 2005 when President George W. Bush ordered 11 million barrels released to replace supplies lost to Hurricane Katrina. The price of gallon of gas moved from $3.04 on Sept. 5, 2005, to $2.91 by Sept. 12 and $2.73 on Sept. 19, according to price records from the federal Energy Information Administration. But here’s an important nuance: The most pronounced drop was in the commodity markets, not at the pump. And whether those savings are passed along the complicated route from reserve to gas station isn’t always so clear. That’s the hang-up with Merkley’s suggestion that relief would be fast. It might; but it isn’t guaranteed. Julie Edwards, his communications director, said that prices at the pump did fall in 2005 about a week after oil was released. By the slow-moving standards of oil production, she said, that should qualify as immediate. Whether to use the SPR is fueling a vigorous debate whose outcome is unclear. But, if it is used it’s almost certain that prices will drop. Whether those lower prices drip all the way to the pump, however, is less clear. For those reasons, we rate this claim: Mostly True.

pomt-10465	Hillary Clinton is "willing to have workers' wages garnisheed if they refuse to buy health insurance."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/21/barack-obama/her-mandate-doesnt-mention-garnishment/	In the final days before the Pennsylvania primary, the two Democratic candidates went after each other on health care. "Hillary Clinton's attacking, but what's she not telling you about her health care plan?" the narrator in a Barack Obama campaign ad asks. "It forces everyone to buy insurance, even if you can't afford it, and you pay a penalty if you don't." Text on the screen shows a news story with the highlighted words, "willing to have workers' wages garnisheed if they refuse to buy health insurance." Read Clinton's health care plan, and you won't find "garnisheed wages" in any of the fine print. But her plan does have an individual mandate — every person in the country will be required to have health insurance one way or another. (Obama's plan has a mandate for children only.) Clinton hasn't specified how she will enforce the mandate. Obama's ad cites an Associated Press article, titled "Clinton acknowledges willingness to tap wages of those who refuse to buy health insurance." That story is a report of an interview Clinton gave to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News' This Week. Stephanopoulos asked Clinton how she intended to enforce the mandate: "Will you have fines for people who don't buy health care, don't go by the mandate? Will you garnish their wages?" Clinton responded by saying that her plan will lower costs and that it's an important principle that everyone be included in the system. After more pressing from Stephanopoulos, Clinton answered his question on garnished wages: "George, we will have an enforcement mechanism, whether it's that or it's some other mechanism through the tax system or automatic enrollments, but you're missing I believe the key point. ... The reason why I think there are a number of mechanisms — going after people's wages, automatic enrollment, when you are at the place of employment, you will be automatically enrolled — whatever the mechanism is, is not as important as, number one, the fundamental commitment to universal health care, the appreciation that with health care tax credits and with a premium cap it will be affordable for everyone." The Obama ad uses Clinton's promise of universal coverage to imply dire consequences for those who don't comply with the mandate. In practice, Clinton's plan, just like Obama's, emphasizes leaving in place employer-paid coverage that people already have, while expanding eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Both of their plans subsidize premiums for some employers and create pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. Both plans include initiatives to increase technology and use more preventative care. Is it possible that Clinton's plan could garnish wages? Yes. Her plan has a mandate, and she said it was one of several ways that a mandate could be enforced. But she was clearly speaking of it as one scenario among several, not advocating it as a definite enforcement mechanism. For this reason, we find Obama's claim to be Half True.

pomt-06387	"The collective net worth of Americans has taken a $5.5 trillion hit ... mainly due to plummeting home values."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/01/nina-turner/nina-turner-says-plummeting-home-values-have-hamme/	Expect to hear more from Nina Turner in the coming months. The Democratic state senator from Cleveland is considering a primary challenge next year against incumbent U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights. The potential race already has political watchers buzzing. Turner has been seen as a rising star since her days on the Cleveland City Council and is well known for breaking with Fudge and other black leaders two years ago to back a successful Cuyahoga County government reform measure. She also is known for her oratorical gifts, having appeared several times on cable network MSNBC to discuss Statehouse issues that have gained attention nationwide. But does her substance match her style? As Turner explores a congressional bid, PolitiFact Ohio decided to explore a guest column she recently authored for the Politic365.com website. The site focuses on minority issues, and Turner’s piece, titled "From Frustration to Prosperity," tackled themes that echo far beyond Ohio. In 670 words, she referred to the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements, quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt and endorsed the notion that government can "breathe life into our otherwise dormant recovery." The piece also was chock full of economic statistics that tied together Turner’s contentions. One statement in particular caught our eye: "The collective net worth of Americans has taken a $5.5 trillion hit, according to the Federal Reserve; mainly due to plummeting home values." Though Turner cited her source, it is not uncommon for politicians to hear and repeat numbers out of context, so PolitiFact Ohio went searching for the original source material. We quickly found that the Christian Science Monitor presented the same figure in the same way in a story published Oct. 19, several days before Turner’s column appeared. "Since 2007, Americans’ collective net worth has fallen about $5.5 trillion, or more than 8.6 percent, according to the Federal Reserve," the article stated. "The bulk of that decline is in real estate, which has lost $4.7 trillion in value, or 22 percent, since 2007." Our Internet search showed the story was picked up by other news outlets across the country. Turner, in an interview, acknowledged that the article got the ball rolling for her column. But once on the Federal Reserve’s website, we didn’t know where in the haystack of data to find the one particular needle of information we needed. And we didn’t receive any help in response to our calls and emails. Luckily, Christian Science Monitor reporter Ron Scherer and Turner’s aide came through -- and both pointed us to the same set of Federal Reserve numbers. In a Sept. 16 statistical release, the Fed provided 120 pages of economic figures. The relevant data comes on a "Balance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations." The table includes figures between 2005 and the second quarter of 2011. And since 2007, net worth -- assets minus liabilities -- dropped from $64.2 trillion to $58.7 trillion, or about $5.5 trillion. The table also confirms the significant drop in home values -- as the Christian Science Monitor reported, about $4.7 trillion -- that accounts for the drastic decrease in net worth. It is important to note that while Turner’s column did not bookend the $5.5 trillion figure with exact dates, it generally addressed the effects of the recent recession -- the same post-2007 period covered by Scherer. So her use of the Fed numbers from 2007 and after made sense. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Turner’s claim True.	None	Nina Turner	None	None	None	2011-11-01T06:00:00	2011-10-24	['United_States']
pomt-13859	"Right now, our corrections department charges taxpayers between $30,000 and $40,000 a year per person we lock up," she said. "That’s actually cheap when you compare us to the rest of the country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/08/rebecca-kleefisch/Kleefisch-per-inmate-cost-comparison/	How much it costs to detain an inmate in each state prison system for a year sounds like a relatively easy question to answer. It isn’t. Appearing on the Jerry Bader Show in April, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch responded to criticism Bader said he had received from listeners after he read on the air an opinion piece that ran in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The piece discussed machining classes offered to inmates. Bader told Kleefisch that he had received a number of emails from listeners who felt that her opinion piece on former inmates’ reentry to society gave deference to people who got into trouble rather than people who stayed out of prison. Kleefisch responded that the vast majority of people who go to prison will return to their communities. "Right now, our corrections department charges taxpayers between $30,000 and $40,000 a year per person we lock up," she said. "That’s actually cheap when you compare us to the rest of the country." She followed that statement by asking rhetorically whether it’s better for taxpayers to return people to the community "ready to succeed and become a taxpayer themselves" or let them depend on government programs or commit another crime and go back to prison at a cost to taxpayers. We wondered if she was right on the numbers and how Wisconsin compares to other states. Kleefisch’s statement can be divided into two parts: That the Wisconsin DOC charges taxpayers between $30,000 and $40,000 per year per inmate. That Wisconsin is "cheap" compared to the rest of the country. On Wisconsin’s cost per inmate per year We asked Kleefisch’s office for evidence of this claim. First, they cited a fact sheet from the Wisconsin Department of Corrections that lists the cost for adult male inmates at $32,394.71 and the cost for adult female inmates at $39,724.00 in the year from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015. The Department of Corrections told us they calculate this number by adding the direct facility costs, including staff salary and benefits; food; utilities; clothing; repair and maintenance costs; other infrastructure costs, and "allocated central office costs." On a basic level, the numbers from the DOC fall within the range Kleefisch cited. How Wisconsin compares Things get more complex when you try to compare prison costs between states. This is primarily because budgeting practices are not uniform and, as far as we found, there are few organizations that do an apples-to-apples comparison. Finally, the one study we were repeatedly directed to uses data from 2010. Kleefisch’s office and other sources we contacted pointed us to a 2012 study from the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit group that says it seeks to build and improve justice systems. The study looks at corrections department data from 40 states, including Wisconsin, that responded to the organization’s surveys. The Vera Institute included in its analysis the costs associated with corrections systems that fall outside the corrections budget in each state. Those additional costs can include underfunded contributions to retiree health care for corrections employees, state contributions to retiree health care on behalf of their corrections department workers, employee benefits and more. Including those, Vera researchers found that "the total price to taxpayers was $39 billion, $5.4 billion more than the $33.5 billion reflected in corrections budgets alone." Wisconsin had relatively few costs that fell outside the DOC budget in 2010 but that wasn’t true of all states. Kleefisch's office argued Wisconsin fares better than other states, since the department fully funds its employee retirement while other states do not. Vera says estimates of underfunded retiree pension and health care benefits are included in the total per-inmate costs. If you rank the states from highest average annual per-inmate cost to lowest using the Vera Institute’s numbers, Wisconsin comes in 14th from the top at $37,994. Wisconsin comes in higher than 26 of the 40 states in the study but lower than some of the top-spending states, including New York, which came in first at $60,076. Kleefisch Chief of Staff Daniel Suhr noted in an email that his boss meant "cheap compared to other states, not cheap compared to a particular mean or median" and noted that Wisconsin comes in lower than New York, California and Illinois. Kleefisch’s statement, however, compared Wisconsin to "the rest of the country." That said, the study itself, one of its authors and others, cautioned against comparing the states. First, the fact that 10 states are not represented in the study is a "big limitation," Chris Henrichson, research director for the Center on Sentencing and Corrections at the Vera Institute, said in an email. In addition, the information is a bit dated. Experts disagreed on whether it could accurately be applied to today. Henrichson said he expected "rankings" to shift somewhat, most likely in states where the inmate populations have changed the most. That said, he did not expect a state at the bottom of the chart to move to the top. Experts also questioned generally whether it is possible to account for all the differences between state corrections systems and their budgeting practices. Our rating Kleefisch said that the state Department of Corrections "charges taxpayers between $30,000 and $40,000 a year per person we lock up. That's actually cheap, when you compare us to the rest of the country." The annual per-inmate cost from DOC does fall within the range she cited. While Kleefisch labeled Wisconsin as cheap compared to other states, the best available numbers suggest the state, at best, is more in the middle of the pack than close to the bottom. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/17242c73-a8fd-48b9-bcb2-e8ffb93301e4	None	Rebecca Kleefisch	None	None	None	2016-07-08T05:00:00	2016-04-20	['None']
pomt-13656	"Hillary Clinton says she wants to, ‘raise taxes on the middle class.’ "	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/05/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-wants-ra/	Hillary Clinton just admitted to a big tax hike, at least according to Donald Trump. The Trump campaign sent an email blast to supporters embedded with a video of a Clinton event in Omaha, Neb., entitled, "Hillary Clinton says she wants to ‘raise taxes on the middle class.’" The subtitles of Clinton’s speech read: "Trump wants to cuts taxes for the super rich. Well, we’re not going there, my friends. I’m telling you right now, we’re going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class." "Wait what?" the videos continues, before playing the damning sentence in slow motion: "We are going to raise taxes on the middle class." "Wait, what?" was the reaction of the Clinton campaign too. Spokesman Josh Schwerin told us Clinton actually said the exact opposite. He pointed to numerous reporters who agreed and forwarded us a transcript of Clinton’s prepared remarks that reads, "We aren’t going to raise taxes on the middle class." It’s a classic case of she-heard-he-heard, so we asked experts to arbitrate. They agreed with the Clinton camp and offered some technical evidence to prove it. Get ready for some science. Alan Yu, a linguistics professor at the University of Chicago who specializes in phonology, ran the audio through a computer program called Praat, which analyzes phonetics. By analyzing the sound waves, we can see that Clinton was saying "aren’t," because she definitely pronounced the "n," though she didn’t really hit the "t." Here’s a screenshot of the results: As you can see, the phoneme (unit of sound) highlighted in pink is an "n," though there’s not a "t." That still suggests she was trying for the word "aren’t." "It is pretty common for people to not release the final ‘t in word-final -nt clusters and is definitely not likely for someone to release the ‘t’in a three-consonant sequence like ‘ntg’ in ‘aren't going,’" Yu told us. "In any case, since she did pronounce the ‘n’ in ‘aren't’, it is clear that she produced the negated form of the copula ‘are.’" Edward Flemming, a linguistics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also ran the audio through Praat and came up with the same results. But even if we didn’t have Praat, he said, context alone sways the argument in the Clinton camp’s favor. "Also if she was going to say ‘we are going to’, wouldn’t she contract it to ‘we’re’, as she does a few words earlier?" Flemming pointed out. "To my ears, it is clear that she is saying ‘aren’t’." Clinton’s tax plan, by the way, does not change the tax rates for the middle class and instead targets the wealthy through small reforms. Our ruling The Trump campaign said, "Hillary Clinton says she wants to, ‘raise taxes on the middle class.’ " According to the transcript, numerous reporters, experts and a computer program, Clinton said the exact opposite.

pomt-12702	Says condoms "used to be tax-exempt here in Texas."	true	/texas/statements/2017/mar/10/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-condoms-used-be-tax-exempt-texas/	An Austin legislator talking up her proposal to exempt feminine hygiene products from the state sales tax asserted that condoms were sold tax-free in Texas for a spell. Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard, speaking to reporters for the Dallas Morning News during a Facebook Live presentation, brought up condom tax history just after suggesting that ever-costly diapers also should not be subject to the state sales tax of 6.25 percent; local governments are allowed to levy up to 2 percent more of sales tax. Condoms, Howard went on, "used to be tax-exempt here in Texas until we changed something in the statute; the wording was such that it ... put them back out there where they were taxed." We wondered about that, ultimately finding changes in law against a governor’s wishes resulted in a type of condom not being subject to sales tax for more than seven years--though no longer. To gauge this claim, we mostly relied on the Texas state comptroller’s office, which oversees state tax collections. By email, spokeswoman Lauren Willis pointed out that a tax-cut package signed into law by Gov. George W. Bush in 1999 included language exempting condoms from the Texas sales tax. Bush’s desire, comptroller’s ruling That’s what was reported at the time, we confirmed, though the tax details rest on a medical angle. Willis emailed us a web link to a March 2000 news story stating that contrary to Bush’s campaign-trail intentions, condoms would soon rank among products not subject to the state sales tax. Starting April 1, 2000, the Morris News Service story said, "Texans won't have to pay sales tax on non-prescription medications, ointments to treat sunburns, laxatives or condoms." Before his re-election in 1998, the story said, Bush had proposed a $400 million tax-cut package including a sales tax break on over-the-counter health items although Bush, an advocate of abstinence education for teenagers, had said the cut wouldn’t apply to condoms. Seeking re-election, Bush said in September 1998 that his proposed tax cut would not extend to nonprescription contraceptives, including condoms, the Morning News reported. "The governor is being touted by some in the GOP has a potential presidential candidate in 2000," the story said, "and some social conservatives have taken a strong stand against promiscuity and premarital sex." But in March 2000, State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander announced she had no choice but to include condoms among items made tax-exempt in the tax-cut measure passed into law the year before. Calling her decision a "matter of law," Rylander pointed out the new law required a drug, medicine or health care product to be exempt from taxes if it has a drug code number issued pursuant to FDA regulations. National drug codes, or NDCs, are three-digit segments that serve as universal product identifiers, the FDA says. Condoms as medicinal A March 2000 Houston Chronicle news story said the legislated tax exemption would apply to all 100,000 nonprescription products carrying an NDC. That story noted that the original legislation, Senate Bill 441 by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, would have exempted only children’s nonprescription medicines from the sales tax but was expanded in Senate-House negotiations to include adult over-the-counter medicines--with the FDA code limitation intended to preclude tax breaks for herbal and folk remedies not sanction by that agency. We confirmed, from SB 441 signed into law by Bush, the inclusion of language exempting from the sales tax any drug or medicine with an FDA-issued "national drug code." We suspect, though, that not all condoms had the codes. When we checked with the FDA about condoms having NDCs, spokeswoman Deborah Kotz replied by email that the agency considers condoms to be "devices" that don’t need NDCs, unlike medicines. Kotz later emailed that regardless, some condom manufacturers have put NDCs on condoms sold over the counter, "often for reimbursement purposes." Some condoms, Kotz said, still have the numbers. Meantime, Willis shared a December 2000 letter from Rylander to a Victoria resident outlining another reason condoms became tax-exempt. Rylander wrote that as agency staff pinned down what would be exempt from the sales tax due to the 1999 law, they recognized that some drugs and medicines didn’t have NDCs. So in building the list of exempt items, Rylander advised, agency staff relied on an FDA list of drugs and medicines and also included items, such as condoms, that fit the state’s statutory definition of a drug or medicine as "an article or substance applied to, ingested, or inhaled by humans marketed for the use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, illness, injury, or pain." Rylander’s conclusion: The "medicated prophylactic devices, which aid in the prevention of disease, qualify for the exemption. However," she wrote, "prophylactic devices that are not medicated are not exempt." Willis confirmed, when we asked, that only condoms containing medication ended up being tax-exempt. No longer Lawmakers didn't immediately restore taxation of all condoms. Willis said, and we confirmed, that the NDC language was removed by a 2001 law yet Senate Bill 1125 left spermicidal condoms tax-exempt by simultaneously adding language exempting products "labeled or required to be labeled with a ‘Drug Facts’ panel in accord" with FDA regulations. By email, Klot separately told us condoms, mostly regulated as devices and not medicines, might have "facts" panels, but the FDA hasn’t required as much. A 2007 change in law limited items exempt from the sales tax to products required to have the "Drug Facts" panels, Willis told us by email, which ended the condom tax exemption as of September 2007. In the fiscal year through August 2016, Willis said, the state sales tax on condoms yielded an estimated $7 million in revenue. Our ruling Howard said condoms "used to be tax-exempt here in Texas." Under a tax-cut measure approved by lawmakers and Bush in 1999, condoms containing spermicide were exempt from the state sales tax starting in April 2000. Another change in law ended that exemption as of September 2007. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-14165	"80 percent of North Carolinians are for the living wage"	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/28/william-barber/nc-naacp-president-says-80-percent-think-minimum-w/	In the rallies against North Carolina’s new LGBT law, commonly known as HB2, protesters have represented not just gay and transgender activists. Also present Monday for the rallies outside the legislature were Latino activists and supporters of the Black Lives Matter and Rise Up for $15 movements. The law doesn’t just ban transgender people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify with. It also bans local governments – cities and counties – from raising the minimum wage that businesses within their boundaries would have to pay workers. Rev. William Barber, president of the N.C. NAACP, said the crowds of protesters were more diverse than just LGBT activists because of the wage issue. And in a speech just days before Monday’s protests, he said the bathroom issue was actually a Trojan Horse, of sorts, for what he deems the real intent of the law – stopping cities from raising the minimum wage, as such cities as Seattle and Los Angeles have recently done. "Eighty percent of North Carolinians are for the living wage," Barber said. "So if North Carolina's legislature and the governor had just put on the table a straight bill to make a prohibition against living wages, they would have been going against 80 percent of North Carolinians." A higher minimum wage is often opposed by Republican politicians. But if Barber was right, a higher minimum wage is a true bipartisan issue – something that 4 out of 5 people support in a state where 4 out of 10 are Democrats. What is a living wage? Polling on this issue is all over the place. There are many ways to ask the question. Some polls give a specific number they test for approval; some let the respondents choose a number; some simply ask whether the minimum wage should be higher; some ask who should have the power to make that decision. But first, perhaps we should define "living wage," the phrase Barber used in place of "higher minimum wage." It’s not just a political catchphrase; there are actual ways of calculating it. In 2004, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning created what she called the Living Wage Calculator. Accounting for location-specific factors such as the cost of food, childcare, housing, transportation and taxes, the tool determines the "living wage" as well as "poverty wage" for states, counties and metro areas. It gives numbers in both wage categories for single adults or couples, and households with zero to three children. It also assumes full-time employment of 2,080 work hours per year (40 hours a week for 52 weeks). For the purposes of this report, we’ll look at the wage for a single person with no children. Right now the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, although some states and cities have gone higher. North Carolina has not, and as Barber accurately said, the state has now forbidden any individual city or county from raising it. In Wake and Mecklenburg counties – the two largest in North Carolina – the Living Wage Calculator says a living wage would be right about $11 an hour. The state average is $10.53, and 13 of 14 metropolitan areas are above $10. A person working full time for $10.53 an hour would make $21,902.40 a year. At the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, that same person would make $15,080 a year – a difference of more than $6,800. Recent polling Now that we know what a living wage is, we can look to see whether Barber is right about 80 percent support. The topic isn’t surveyed much at the state level, but luckily two polls have tackled this topic in the last month. They’re from the left-leaning Public Policy Polling and the more centrist Elon University Poll. A spokesman for the state’s main right-leaning polling firm, The Civitas Institute, said there’s no record of Civitas ever having polled people on the topic of minimum wage. Public Policy Polling found that 76 percent of North Carolinians support a minimum wage of at least $10 an hour. That isn’t an exact confirmation of Barber’s claim, since it’s slightly lower than 80 percent and the living wage is $10.53, not $10, but it’s pretty close. However, the Elon poll found less support for a $10 or higher minimum wage, 65 percent. It also arrived at that number differently than PPP. PPP gave five choices, asking people to say if they thought there shouldn’t be a minimum wage, if it should remain $7.25, or if it should increase to $10, $12 or $15. Elon asked people to name whatever they thought the minimum wage should be. A plurality (27 percent) said $10. In total, 65 percent said $10 or higher. That’s certainly less than the 80 percent claim Barber made or the 76 percent that PPP found. But complicating matters, Elon also found less support than PPP for keeping the current minimum wage. The difference is that many in the Elon Poll (23 percent) named a number between $7.26 and $9.99 – an option that PPP didn’t give. So while the Elon poll found only 65 percent support for wages that could be called a living wage under the MIT definition, it did find 88 percent support for raising the minimum wage at least a little. Political breakdown Barber framed his claim in the context of the state’s Republican leaders trying to avoid blowback for putting restrictions on a higher minimum wage. So we decided to look at how Republicans feel about the subject. Just like they phrased their questions differently, PPP and Elon also asked about party affiliations differently. PPP found that 63 percent of people who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 also support at least a $10 minimum wage, as do 92 percent of Barack Obama voters and 65 percent of others. The Elon poll found that 46 percent of self-identified Republicans support a $10 or higher minimum wage, compared with 86 percent of Democrats and with 62 percent of others. Our ruling It’s impossible to say for certain that a full 80 percent of North Carolinians want a living wage in North Carolina, like Barber said. But it does appear that a vast majority support the idea, including about half of Republicans and nearly all Democrats. One recent poll found 76 percent support for a $10 or higher minimum wage. With a margin of error of 3.4 points, Barber’s 80 percent claim would be well within reason if this was the only recent poll. But another recent poll found just 65 percent support. The average of the two polls is 70.5 percent. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	William Barber	None	None	None	2016-04-28T17:59:19	2016-04-22	['North_Carolina']
pomt-04790	Says 88 Texas constables have died in the line of duty.	true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/23/bruce-elfant/bruce-elfant-says-88-texas-constables-have-died-li/	The day a Brazos County constable was shot to death in College Station, a Travis County counterpart pointed out that constables often confront risks. "Texas constables serve as the enforcement arm for our courts," Bruce Elfant, the constable for Precinct 5, said in an Aug. 13, 2012, statement emailed to news organizations. "Every day we carry out court orders to arrest individuals, remove children from abusive conditions, seize property and evict people from their homes. Constables are also responsible for enforcing child-support orders and executing family violence protective orders. Quite often when serving court notices or enforcing court orders constables are confronted with hostility, resistance and, on some occasions, deadly force." The statement continues: "Eighty-eight Texas constables have died in the line of duty while serving their communities." We asked Elfant’s office to back up that count. Elfant, who is also the 2012 Democratic nominee for Travis County tax assessor-collector, said by telephone that he based his figure on adding to a tally of 86 that was part of a video about constables posted a few years ago on the Travis County website. He said he must have miscounted when he penciled in 88. Elfant said the original count came from information compiled by others. He later forwarded a list that he had fielded from Ron Hickman, the constable in Harris County’s Precinct 4, indicating that 215 constables or officers in constable offices in about 100 counties have died in the line of duty since Oct. 17, 1852. That tally includes150 constables, the list suggests. About 60 of the deaths occurred in the 1800s with nearly 110 taking place from 1900 through 1939. Eleven took place in the 1940s, none in the 1950s, four in the 1960s -- and 10 through the rest of the last century. The list shows a dozen on-duty deaths since July 2003. Listed causes of death are topped by gunfire, the cause in about 170 deaths. Less frequent causes include car accidents, heart attacks and stabbings. By telephone, Hickman told us much of the research was undertaken by volunteers connected to the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which describes itself as the state’s largest union of law enforcement officers. By phone, CLEAT spokesman Charley Wilkison told us the group’s members helped spearhead the creation of the Texas Peace Officers’ Memorial northeast of the Texas Capitol. He said the group’s special counsel and former president, Ron DeLord, has long guided volunteer research efforts to confirm officers who died in the line of duty. Wilkison said volunteer retired police officers comb libraries and cemeteries and other resources, checking on whether officers died in the line of duty. Wilkison said relevant findings are then made available to the agency that determines whose names appear on the memorial, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Standards and Education. Kaye Wilson, a commission executive assistant, told us by telephone that as of May 2011, the last time names were added to the memorial, 85 constables were shown as having died in the line of duty. She added by email that this count is likely not complete. The Elfant-provided list shows three constable officers who have died in the line of duty since then; it does not yet include Brian Bachmann, the Brazos County Precinct 1 constable who died in the College Station shootout. The count of 85 constables whose names are on the memorial is slightly less than the 88 Elfant originally aired. But it’s considerably less than the 150 tally of constables felled in the line of duty on the list Elfant offered to back up his claim. Time for subtraction. We counted more than 30 constables on the non-government list who have yet to be approved to appear on the memorial. At our request, DeLord compared the lists and identified about 30 additional constables whose names are on the memorial but were not shown on the state’s list. Also, he suggested that another one or two on the memorial were identified by the agency as deputy sheriffs but they also were constables. He pointed out that officers on the memorial are not identified by rank. Ken Mobley, the agency’s legislative liaison, later told us by phone that it’s reasonable to say that at least 115 Texas constables have died in the line of duty. "It could be more," Mobley said. Our ruling It may not be settled precisely how many constables have died in the line of duty over the years. But we ultimately found agreement between the agency that oversees the Capitol memorial and outside researchers that the total is at least 115 deaths, not 88. Elfant understated the total. His statement still rates as True.	None	Bruce Elfant	None	None	None	2012-08-23T12:06:13	2012-08-13	['Texas']
pomt-04660	Says Republicans "have declared that they’re going to convert the Medicare program into a voucher program."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/10/upendra-chivukula/republicans-plan-convert-medicare-voucher-program-/	From state Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula to President Barack Obama, Democratic leaders have been denouncing what they consider the Republicans’ plan to turn Medicare into a voucher system. Chivukula, who is looking to unseat Republican Congressman Leonard Lance this November, repeated that claim in a TV interview leading up to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. "The Republicans have declared war on women," Chivukula, who represents parts of Middlesex and Somerset counties, said in the Aug. 31 interview on NJToday. "They have declared that they’re going to convert the Medicare program into a voucher program." PolitiFact National issued a Mostly True ruling on a similar claim made by Obama last month. The president claimed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, "want to turn Medicare into a voucher system." Just as in that fact-check, Chivukula’s claim is mostly on solid ground. The Medicare proposal backed by Romney and Ryan would provide "premium support" payments to future beneficiaries to purchase health insurance. There are some distinctions between the two terms, but the word "voucher" generally describes this approach. Chivukula told us "voucher" is an appropriate way of describing the proposal, adding that the system would force beneficiaries to shop around for coverage. First, let’s explain how the plan works. Under the traditional Medicare program, which is available to anyone 65 or older, the government pays health care providers directly for services. Beneficiaries must bear the cost of deductibles and co-insurance. Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, has been the chief architect of a proposal to dramatically restructure Medicare. Romney has said his and Ryan’s Medicare plans are the "same if not identical -- it’s probably close to identical." The latest version of Ryan’s plan was approved in March by the GOP-controlled House as part of a budget resolution, but it was later rejected by the Democrat-led Senate. The plan would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries and individuals who become eligible before 2023. But starting in 2023, newly eligible beneficiaries would receive a premium support payment to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The payments would either pay for or offset the cost of health care premiums. In a report accompanying their budget resolution, House Republicans argued the proposal was not about providing vouchers. "This is not a voucher program; a Medicare premium-support payment would be paid, by Medicare, directly to the plan or the fee-for-service program to subsidize its cost," according to the report. So, the claims by Obama and Chivukula raised the same question: Is it reasonable to refer to premium support payments as vouchers? As our PolitiFact colleagues noted, there are distinctions between the two terms, dealing with the type of inflation adjustment used and the degree of marketplace regulation imposed. Ryan’s most recent plan more closely reflects a pure premium support, but substantively, it’s somewhere between the two approaches. Henry Aaron, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank, told PolitiFact National "that premium support is a type of voucher." But Robert Moffit, a health policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact National that the Obama campaign’s use of the term "voucher" is not justified, since the Ryan plan includes more regulation than for, say, airline vouchers for food and drink. Our ruling In a TV interview, Chivukula claimed Republicans "have declared that they’re going to convert the Medicare program into a voucher program." Starting in 2023, the Republicans’ plan would provide premium support payments for new beneficiaries to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The term "voucher" generally describes this approach. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

"Allen voted to end Pell Grants for 84,000 students," Kaine said in a September 12 news release. The Pell Grant program is primarily aimed at helping low-income undergraduates by providing federal grants, based on need. The maximum award to a student is now $5,500 a school year. Allen served in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2007. Kaine backs up his charge by citing a vote Allen cast on Sept. 10, 2003, on an amendment to an appropriations bill funding the Department of Education and other agencies. The amendment proposed to stop a plan by the Department of Education to tighten the formula for determining Pell Grant eligibility during the 2004-05 school year by changing how much families could deduct on financial disclosure forms for the state and local taxes they paid. It would have been the first time in 10 years that the formula had been changed. Demand for Pell Grants had been steadily rising as more low-income students were going to college. The new formula was designed to ease pressure on the program by ending the eligibility of students who came from the most well-off of the low-income families. Sen. John Corzine, D-NJ, successfully sponsored an amendment to delay implementation of the new formula for a year. The amendment passed the Senate, 51-44, with Allen voting against it. Kaine’s campaign cited a story that ran in The Chronicle of Higher Education shortly after the vote. It said the Department of Education estimated that 84,000 students -- 1.6 percent of Pell Grant recipients -- would lose eligibility for the program in the 2004-05 school year if the new formula went into effect. The 84,000 figure was widely reported in 2003 and a number of newspapers, including The New York Times, attributed it to a study by the Congressional Research Service that June. We could not find a copy of the CRS report. But we did track down a January 2005 study by the U.S. Government Accounting Office that said the changed formula "would have likely resulted in a decrease in Pell Grant awards for about 36 percent of students, and an additional 92,000 applicants (2 percent) would no longer have been eligible for the grant." The Education Department said most of those losing eligibility would be students from higher income families who would no longer receive the minimum grant of $400 back then. Allen’s campaign, in a web post, said Kaine’s claim "doesn’t add up," because Allen voted for the for the overall education appropriation bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, 2003 and it increased total spending for Pell Grants as well the number of recipients. Department of Education figures show the appropriation for Pell Grants rose from $11.36 billion in the 2002-2003 fiscal year to $12 billion in 2003-2004 -- a $640 million increase. That would have outweighed the $290 million in savings from the changed formula estimated by the GAO. The number of Pell Grant recipients increased from 5.1 million in the 2003-2004 school year to 5.3 million in 2004-2005. Congress did not stand in the way of the formula change a second time and it was incorporated in the education budget for the 2005-2006 school year. The number of Pell Grant recipients fell to 5.17 million that year. The total appropriation for the grants rose to $12.36 billion due to the complicated nature of the program. Our ruling Kaine said Allen voted to end Pell Grants for 84,000 students. The need-based federal grant typically goes to undergraduate students from low-income families. There’s no doubt that Allen in 2003 cast a specific vote to alter the financial aid formula for awarding Pell Grants and that the non-partisan GAO said the change would drop 92,000 students from eligibility. He was on the losing side of that vote. Allen argues that even if the more restrictive formula had been enacted back then, the overall education budget -- which he supported -- would have still increased total funding for Pell Grants and the number of recipients would have risen the next school year. He’s right on that point. So Kaine’s statement is accurate but lacks some information: Allen’s vote would not have cut the overall Pell Grant program; it would have slowed its rate of growth. For that we reason, we rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2012-10-01T06:00:00	2012-09-12	['None']
pomt-03300	The "most realistic estimates" for jobs created by Keystone XL are "maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/31/barack-obama/obama-says-keystone-xl-would-mean-maybe-2000-jobs/	The Keystone XL pipeline that would carry oil from Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Texas Gulf coast presents President Barack Obama with no easy choice. While officially, the final decision to block or approve it is in the hands of the State Department, politically, the plan pits two key Democratic constituencies against each other, environmentalists and organized labor. For the first group, extracting petroleum from Canadian tar sands is a climate change disaster. For the unions, the project means jobs. Fresh off a speech that underscored the need to restore America’s middle class, Obama talked about the steps that lie ahead for the 875-mile link between the Canadian border and a distribution hub in Nebraska. The central question, he said in an interview with the New York Times, is whether this would "significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere." As for jobs, the president went out of his way to downplay them. In the big picture, they were but a "blip", as the president put it. "Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that that’s true," Obama said. "Any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take a year or two -- and then after that we’re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in a economy of 150 million working people." There’s been a running battle over jobs and the Keystone XL. We’ve checked claims that it would employ as many as 20,000 workers. We rated that False; even the company behind the pipeline backed away from that number. To be clear, there are all sorts of complications when it comes to predicting how many jobs a complex, two-year project will generate. There are the direct construction jobs; there’s indirect employment at companies that provide the materials and services related to the work; and then there’s the really indirect effect that comes when money is pumped into an economy and people buy food and pay rent and so on. But out of all the numbers bruited about, the president’s seemed particularly low. We asked the White House for evidence to support the claim. All they offered was a statement from spokesman Josh Earnest during a press briefing. "There are a range of estimates out there about the economic impact of the pipeline," Earnest said. "What the president is interested in doing is draining the politics out of this debate and evaluating this project on the merits." During the New York Times interview, the president invited reporters to use the most realistic estimates. So we went to the State Department’s lengthy environmental impact statement on the project that came out in March. In that report, the lowest estimate for jobs directly tied to construction was 3,900 jobs a year. That number came after analysts wrestled with the stop-and-start nature of construction work and converted the jobs to a yearly estimate. "Approximately 10,000 construction workers engaged for 4-to 8-month seasonal construction periods (approximately 5,000 to 6,000 per construction period) would be required to complete the proposed project. When expressed as average annual employment, this equates to approximately 3,900 jobs." The analysis noted that 90 percent of those jobs would come from "a unique national labor force that is highly specialized in pipeline construction techniques." It also confirmed that there would be few long-term jobs, something on the order of 35. The largest jobs number in the State Department report is an annual average of 42,100, but that includes part-time jobs and folds in the ripple effects as spending moves through the economy, measured over two years. The further out from the immediate project the analysis moves, the less certain the results. The report said these jobs would amount to 0.02 percent of total American employment, adding some weight to the president’s characterization of the impact on the overall jobs picture. The North American Building Trades Union said it was disappointed with Obama’s words and pressed him to let the pipeline move forward. "So that workers and their families can share in the economic recovery he is touting," said union president Sean McGarvey. "The president should look to his own State Department’s findings that there will be meaningful job creation." We looked at the website of the Sierra Club, one of the leading environmental groups opposed to the pipeline, and they used the State Department’s 3,900 annual number. The only place we found anything close to the president’s figure was at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations Global Labor Institute. Assistant director Lara Skinner co-wrote a report highly critical of the pipeline. Skinner argued that the 3,900 covered employment for two years and that it should be divided in half. "That's where the 2,000 job figure comes from," Skinner said. However, if that is what the State Department had meant, the White House could have easily referred to it to support the president’s claim. Our ruling Obama said the Keystone XL pipeline might produce about 2,000 jobs during construction, based on the most reliable estimates. The White House provided no supporting evidence and the administration’s own State Department predicted that while the pipeline would produce few permanent jobs, the construction process itself would create nearly twice as many jobs as the president said. We rate the statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-07-31T10:55:42	2013-07-27	['None']
pomt-08697	"Close to 30% of our federal prison population consists of illegal immigrants."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/08/daniel-mielke/congressional-candidate-daniel-mielke-says-almost-/	When it comes to red-meat political issues, few subjects are redder than immigration, with each side playing to emotions with their arguments. The result: Short tempers and, well, some tall tales. Republican Daniel Mielke, a candidate for the U.S. House seat now held by Dave Obey in Wisconsin’s 7th District, entered the fray with a claim he posted on his campaign website that points to the impact of illegal immigrants on federal prisons. The statement: "Close to 30% of our federal prison population consists of illegal immigrants. We cannot continue to incarcerate criminals from other countries at the taxpayer’s expense. We must stop the tide of criminal importation. This alone would cut our prison costs by almost a third." It costs about $6.2 billion a year to run the federal prison system, so that sounds like a pretty huge savings if it’s true. We decided to find out if it is. We started with cut-costs-by-one-third aspect of the statement. Even if the inmate population suddenly dropped, many fixed costs would remain -- electricity, staffing, maintenance. There would be savings, of course, but not necessarily at a one-to-one rate. When asked about his claim of cutting prison costs by a third, Mielke backed off. Within a few days he added this qualifier to his website: "Note: figures above are based on a cost per prisoner average. Actual cost could vary, individually, depending on the circumstances such as health of individual, behavior of prisoner etc. Also there is a set cost that would exist even if our prisons were empty." But what about Mielke’s main point -- that nearly 30 percent of the federal inmates should never have been in the country in the first place? As his source, Mielke cites Lou Dobbs, the former CNN pundit known for his outspoken and passionate views on immigration. More precisely, we found, it was a reporter on the show Dobbs used to host. On the April 1, 2006 broadcast of "Lou Dobbs Tonight," CNN reporter Christine Romans said: "According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 30 percent of federal prisoners are not U.S. citizens." She went on to say, without attributing a source: "Most are thought to be illegal aliens." That statement has been bouncing around the Internet ever since. We went to the Federal Bureau of Prisons to see if the reporter and, therefore, candidate Mielke were on target. The bureau’s website says that 73.4 percent of the federal inmates are U.S. citizens, and that more than 26 percent are not citizens. That’s just over a quarter of the inmates, within spitting distance to the nearly one-third claimed by Mielke. But there’s a catch here -- and it's a big one. Non-citizen doesn’t necessarily mean illegal immigrant, as many people receive visas or green cards to live and work in America. Presumably, some of these legal immigrants chose crime as their vocation. And the agency itself does not categorize inmates as legal citizens or illegal citizens. "Can we make that leap that if they’re of a different nationality they are illegal immigrants?" spokeswoman Felicia Ponce said in an interview. "No." Despite that, Mielke says the one-third figure remains correct, arguing legal aliens lose their right to visas or green cards as soon as they get convicted. Once again, he’s in the ballpark. Just not the right seat. The process of revoking green cards generally does not begin until after the convict completes his prison sentence, said attorney Grant Sovern, who heads the immigration practice at the law firm of Quarles & Brady and teaches immigration law at the University of Wisconsin Law School. Until that time the person is here legally, he said. "If it’s a felony, the visa is not revoked immediately, but you are deportable," Sovern said, adding the same is true if the person has a green card, or permanent residence status. When the person completes his prison term, immigration officials decide whether to begin deportation proceedings, he said. In most cases, he said, they will seek to deport. Gail Montenegro, a spokeswoman in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Chicago office, agreed, though she noted that immigrants on visas -- such as a work or student visa -- could be considered "out-of-status" when convicted of a crime. That means "the person is deportable and could be placed into deportation proceedings by ICE." Mielke’s statement, however, didn’t leave room for legal immigrants who end up committing crimes, but said the percentage applied to immigrants who come here illegally and commit them. He described it as stopping the tide of "criminal importation." So, in his statement did Mielke cross the border between fact and fiction? He took what was an easy-to-verify fact -- the number of non-citizens who are guests of Uncle Sam in the federal prison system -- to make a political point. But instead of going to the source, he relied on an unattributed comment on a political talk show. In doing so, he missed the correct figure by a little and missed some key nuances by a lot. We rate his comment False.	None	Daniel Mielke	None	None	None	2010-09-08T10:00:00	2010-09-07	['None']
pomt-13888	Says Hillary Clinton’s State Department "approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-inaccurately-suggests-clinton-got-pai/	Hillary Clinton’s eponymous nonprofit foundation provided ready-made fodder for a series of attacks from Donald Trump. In a major speech last week, the presumptive Republican nominee recited a number of claims from Clinton Cash, a 2015 bestselling investigation into donations to the Clinton Foundation. Among them: "Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation — $145 million dollars." We wanted to vet this charge of Clinton engaging in pay-to-play politics. Trump’s claim is a reductive version of his source material’s findings and runs into several problems. First, the State Department did approve of Russia’s gradual takeover of a company with significant U.S. uranium assets, but it didn’t act unilaterally. State was one of nine government agencies, not to mention independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal. Second, while nine people related to the company did donate to the Clinton Foundation, it’s unclear whether they were still involved in the company by the time of the Russian deal and stood to benefit from it. Third, most of their Clinton Foundation donations occurred before and during Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid, before she could have known she would become secretary of state. The bottom line: While the connections between the Clinton Foundation and the Russian deal may appear fishy, there’s simply no proof of any quid pro quo. Clinton’s unsubstantiated role Did Clinton singlehandedly imperil national security by greenlighting the Russian deal, as Trump implies? No. The company in question, Uranium One, does have mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity. It churns out a smaller portion of actual uranium produced in the United States (11 percent in 2014), according to Oilprice.com. But that’s less cause for alarm than Trump is suggesting. For one, the United States doesn’t actually produce all that much uranium (about 2 percent in 2015) and is actually a net importer of the chemical, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at Middlebury Institute and former director at the New America Foundation. For another, Russia doesn’t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, Oilprice.org pointed out, "so it’s somewhat disingenuous to say this uranium is now Russia’s, to do with what it pleases." The Kremlin was likely more interested in Uranium One’s assets in Kazakhstan, the world’s largest producer. Trump is also wrong that Clinton alone allowed the transfer. The Kremlin’s 2010 purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One had to be approved by the nine members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. That included Clinton as secretary of state, but also the secretaries of the Treasury (the chairman of the committee), Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security as well as the the heads of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The deal also had to be okayed by the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission as well as Utah’s nuclear regulator. While it’s conceivable Clinton advocated for the deal, the author of Clinton Cash Peter Schweizer himself admitted that he doesn’t have "direct evidence" proving Clinton played a part. The State Department’s principal representative on the committee, Jose Fernandez, told Time that Clinton "never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter." Why on earth would the United States allow the transfer of a uranium company? As others, including a New York Times’ investigation, have explained, the United States was still seeking to "reset" its relationship with Russia and trying to get the Kremlin on board with its Iran nuclear deal. But at the end of the day, the Russian deal wasn’t that big. Russia’s purchase of the company "had as much of an impact on national security as it would have if they set the money on fire," said Lewis. "That’s probably why (CFIUS and the NRC ) approved it." A condensed timeline Trump's suggestion that the Russian deal occurred "while nine investors funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation" is not supported by the evidence presented in Clinton Cash. On the contrary, the donations detailed by author Schweizer occurred at least two years before the deal. Furthermore, it’s not clear from the book whether all nine of the Clinton Foundation donors were actually involved in the Russian deal at all. The timeline is key here, so bear with us. Uranium One had several facelifts between 2007 and 2013. Back in 2007, it was a South African company that had mining assets in Africa and Australia. That spring, it merged with another mining company, the Canada-based UrAsia Energy. The combined company kept Uranium One as its name but Toronto as its base. Under the terms of the deal, the shareholders of UrAsia retained a 60 percent stake in the new company. Russia didn’t get involved until two years later, in June 2009, when its nuclear agency started buying shares in Uranium One. The Kremlin upped its stake in the company from 17 percent to a controlling 51 percent the following year, and assumed total ownership of the company in 2013 (and renamed it to Uranium One Holding). Out of the nine investors listed in Clinton Cash, five were linked to UrAsia only, and Schweizer doesn’t say whether they were still involved with the company after the merger and when Russia was buying it out. (We asked Schweizer’s publicist via email, but we didn’t hear back.) Using SEDAR, Canada’s filing system for public companies, we could only verify one UrAsia shareholder (Ian Telfer) who also owned stocks in Uranium One in 2010 and who chaired its Board of Directors. A New York Times investigation on the topic linked two others to Uranium One. Why does it matter? Because UrAsia investors could have conceivably sold their shares before they could have profited off the Russian deal. In other words, giving to the Clinton Foundation wouldn’t have mattered to the allegedly Clinton-backed acquisition of 2010 if they had no stake in it. We created a breakdown of the nine "investors" and their donations to the Clinton Foundation, based on the most complete information we could find through the Clinton Foundation, media reports and public filings as well as what Clinton Cash reported. "Investor" Connection Donation Year Frank Giustra* UrAsia Energy founder $131.3 million Late 2005 and June 2007 Frank Holmes* Executive at U.S. Global Investors, which held Uranium One shares $250,000 to $500,000 $100,000 in March 2008 Neil Woodyer* Advisor to Uranium One $500,000 March 2008 Robert Disbrow Broker at Haywood Securities, which provided $58 million in capital UrAsia-Uranium One merger, according to Clinton Cash $1 million to $5 million $1 million in 2007 Paul Reynolds* Financial advisor on UrAsia-Uranium One merger $1 million to $5 million $1 million in March 2008 Robert Cross UrAsia shareholder and director $500,000 March 2008 Egizio Bianchini Cohead BMO’s Global Metals and Mining group, underwriter for UrAsia-Uranium One Merger $600,000 March 2008 Sergey Kurzin UrAsia shareholder $1 million March 2008 Ian Telfer** Uranium One chairman $3 million March 2008 Total $139.15 million to $146.9 million *Also named and confirmed by the New York Times investigation. As you can see in the chart, the $145 million in donations didn’t happen "while" the Russian deal was occurring in 2010. According to Clinton Cash, five donors contributed $136.4 million at or before a March 2008 benefit hosted by Giustra. While the book doesn’t specify when the other four donated to the Clinton Foundation, we were able to trace another $2.6 million to the March fundraiser. Furthermore, the bulk of the $145 million comes from Frank Giustra, the founder of UrAsia Energy and a major Clinton Foundation donor. Guistra says he sold all of his stakes in Uranium One in the fall of 2007, "at least 18 months before Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State" and three years before the Russian deal. We couldn’t independently verify Giustra’s claim from UrAsia’s or Uranium One’s public filings. Assuming Giustra is telling the truth, the donation amount from confirmed Uranium One investors drops from over $145 million to just $4 million. All of these occurred before the Russia deal. One caveat: The New York Times found that Ian Telfer donated between $1.3 million and $5.6 million to the Clinton Foundation during and after the review process for the Russian deal. So there’s evidence showing that one man involved with Uranium One (Telfer) donated millions to the Clinton Foundation at the same time as the deal. That certainly doesn’t look good for Hillary Clinton, but it’s a far cry from nine investors funneling $145 million. Our ruling Trump said, "Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation." There’s a grain of truth in this claim. Clinton’s State Department was one of nine government agencies to approve Russia’s acquisition of a company with U.S. uranium assets. Nine people related the company at some point in time donated to the Clinton Foundation, but we only found evidence that one did so "while" the Russian deal was occurring. The bulk of the $145 million in donations came two years before the deal. Trump is certainly within his right to question the indisputable links between Clinton Foundation donors and their ties to Uranium One, but Trump’s charge exaggerates the links. More importantly, his suggestion of a quid pro quo is unsubstantiated, as Schweizer the author of Clinton Cash himself has admitted. On the most basic level, Trump’s timeline is off. Most of the donations occurred before Clinton was named secretary of state. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False. Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled the name of the State Department’s representative on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. He is Jose Fernandez.

pomt-08758	"Jim Renacci cheated on his income taxes" and is a "deadbeat citizen."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/27/afscme/afscme-ad-calls-ohio-congressional-candidate-jim-r/	With control of the U.S. House at stake, Republicans and Democrats are waging fierce election campaigns across the country. In Ohio, at least four seats are considered in play, including the 16th Congressional District seat held by freshman Democratic Rep. John Boccieri of Alliance, a former state legislator who faces a well-financed Republican challenge from businessman Jim Renacci, a former Wadsworth mayor. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union has joined the fight, attacking Renacci in two television advertisements. We recently looked into a statement in the first ad, which accused Renacci of backing a massive tax increase, and found it to be Half True. The second ad levels an even harsher accusation that Renacci "cheated on his income taxes" and labels him a "deadbeat citizen." Renacci has filed a defamation lawsuit in Stark County Common Pleas Court over the ad, which says he "hid" more than $13 million, and was forced to pay $1.4 million in back taxes and penalties. We wanted to see if AFSCME got closer to the truth the second time around. The basis of the attack is a dispute between Renacci and the Ohio Department of Taxation. Renacci has built a fortune from business interests that include nursing homes, real estate investments, auto and motorcycle dealerships, a bar and grill, an arena football team and a minor-league baseball team. The tax department assessed Renacci about $1.4 million in back taxes, interest and penalties for misreporting his income in 2000. Renacci and his wife, Tina, filed a state tax return for that year that claimed they had a loss of $247,336, but an audit found they actually made $13,730,440. The couple filed a tax appeal when the state dinged them for $954,650 in back taxes, $146,938 in interest and $293,876 in penalties. At issue was Renacci’s trust income from an "S" corporation that had not been subject to state taxes for several years before Ohio’s tax commissioner issued an "information release" in January 2000 that changed the state’s policy and directed taxpayers to add such trust income to their federal adjusted gross income. "S" corporations permit income to be taxed at an individual rate for federal tax purposes and avoid double taxation on corporate income. The tax department followed up with another information release in 2002 warning that it was launching audits and would impose fraud penalties on taxpayers who did not file amended returns reflecting the trust income and pay the taxes due. Renacci was among a group of taxpayers who fought the state decision. He contended that the trust income should have been tax-free and that he had "reasonable cause" to exclude it on his tax return, according to tax department and court documents. Others dropped their appeals, but Renacci continued to fight, despite an Ohio Supreme Court ruling in 2006 in a similar case in which the court said the trust income was subject to taxation. In that case, the taxpayers reported their S corporation income on their 2000 tax return and then unsuccessfully asked for a refund. Court records show the Renaccis eventually settled the tax dispute and sent the state the full amount due. "He was proud of his fight, and to have fought till the end, along with many other Ohioans for tax fairness," Renacci’s campaign spokesman Jim Slepian said in an interview for a Plain Dealer story in April. The AFSCME ad cites as its source an Associated Press story from April that said Renacci "fought vigorously but eventually paid" the back taxes and other assessments. Webster’s New World Dictionary defines cheat as "a person who defrauds, deceives, or tricks others; swindler." And it defines deadbeat as "a person who tries to evade paying debts." It seems legitimate to raise questions about Renacci’s failure to properly report his income. Some facts are not in dispute. He could have disclosed the trust income on his tax return, as the state warned he should, but he didn’t. He could have paid the taxes and then contested the amount, but he didn’t. He didn’t amend his return, despite the explicit warning in 2002 from the tax department that in not doing so he could face penalties for failure to pay and fraud. But in the end, after taking his dispute to court and working within the system to resolve it, he did ultimately pay the state the full amount due and he wasn’t ever charged with tax fraud. We rate AFSCME’s statement as Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	AFSCME	None	None	None	2010-08-27T08:00:00	2010-08-17	['None']
pomt-13215	Says Joe Heck "voted to shut down the government."	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/oct/20/catherine-cortez-masto/catherine-cortez-masto-claims-joe-heck-supported-2/	In the first and likely last Nevada U.S. Senate debate, Democratic candidate Catherine Cortez Masto accused her opponent, Republican Joe Heck, of supporting the 2013 government shutdown. While answering if they’ll pledge to never shut down the federal government, Cortez Masto quickly accused Heck of saying one thing on stage and doing another in office. "Congressman Heck’s already done it," she said as both candidates raised their hands. "He voted to shut down the government and continued with the sequestration, so I don’t know why he’s raising his hand." The former Democratic attorney general continued to hammer the same point (her campaign said she mistakenly said "sequestration" instead of shutdown) throughout the hour-long debate, which Heck fervently denied. And at least one outside group has made the same claim in a television ad. Heck was initially on the side of House Republicans who led the budget standoff, but the 16-day shutdown and various votes are all more complex than Cortez Masto implies. Government shutdown Cortez Masto was referring to the October 2013 two-week budget stalemate between congressional Republicans and President Barack Obama over funding for the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans at the time attempted to use legislation meant to finance the government as leverage to roll back portions of the 2013 health care law, with Senate Democrats and the president dismissed as dangerous political maneuvring. During the deadlock, many governmental services were placed on hold, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees were furloughed or asked to work without pay. The stalemate finally ended two weeks later, with Republicans backing down to avoid the government defaulting on its debts. Heck, first elected to Congress in 2010, was in office through the shutdown. Cortez Masto’s campaign cited a Sept. 30, 2013, vote as the vote to shut down the government, and claims that Heck and House Republicans then voted 16 times against efforts to reopen the government. Meanwhile, Heck’s campaign is adamant that he voted for every bill to fund the government that came to the House floor, including the final bill that ended the shutdown. (A frustrated Heck said multiple times in the debate that there was "never a vote to shut down the government.") So which candidate is right? It’s true that Heck did join with the majority of House Republicans in supporting government spending bills widely viewed at the time of having no chance of passing because they defunded or delays portions of the Affordable Care Act. Polls taken immediately after the shutdown indicated that voters blamed Republicans more than the president over the standoff. Cortez Masto’s campaign said she was referring to a Sept. 30 vote on a motion to "recede and concur," as the measure to "shut down the government," which had the practical effect of funding the government until December and delaying some requirements in the new health care law for a year. Heck joined a majority of Republicans in voting for the continuing resolution despite the well-publicized threat of a presidential veto, and said in a statement that the House vote reflected what the American people wanted. Cortez Masto campaign spokesman Zach Hudson said the vote essentially equates to voting to shut down the government, as it came on the last day before the shutdown would begin and in the face of Democrats flatly rejecting any spending bill with health care law riders attached. "Congress has one key duty in the Constitution: pass spending bills that fund the government," Hudson said in an email. "Clearly, Republicans cared more about defunding the Affordable Care Act than keeping the government open." Cortez Masto’s campaign sent us a list of 16 votes taken by Heck during the shutdown, all of which were successful Republican votes to table, or kill, Democratic procedural motions to bring the clean spending bill up for a vote. That doesn’t necessarily equate to a vote prolonging the standoff — all the votes cited would have only given Democrats the opportunity to bring a clean spending bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote. Heck never outright said whether or not he’d support a hypothetical clean funding bill, but after 16 days of the shutdown, the Senate approved a bipartisan "clean" spending bill funding the government through January 2014 on an 81-18 margin. Heck and 86 other House Republicans then voted with Democrats to approve the spending bill, which was promptly signed by the president. In a statement after the vote, Heck said he was "deeply disappointed" that spending changes weren’t addressed but that "government by crisis is not an effective way to govern." The Las Vegas Sun characterized his actions as a "classic Heck move," detailing multiple times where he "held the party line" until the last minute and ended up voting for a compromise final deal. But Heck was right in that there was never any up-or-down vote on some sort of a "government shut-down bill," and all of the measures Heck voted on would have funded the federal government. Heck’s campaign also sent PolitiFact a list of 15 other bills that either funded the government entirely with health care riders attached, or funded individual agencies in a piecemeal manner. Senate Democrats rejected those measures entirely, saying they would only accept a "clean" funding bill. Heck campaign spokesman Brian Baulta said those votes backed up the candidate’s assertion during the debate that he voted for "every piece of legislation" to open the government back up. "At the end of the day, Dr. Heck voted for the non-procedural bills to keep the government open, voted for the bills to fund important government programs, and voted for the final bill to re-open the government," Baluta said in an email. "Dr. Heck preferred negotiating versus the type of brinksmanship and refusal to compromise that led to the shutdown." PolitiFact previously gave Florida Sen. Marco Rubio a Mostly False rating for saying that he was "never in favor of shutting down the government," but Republican senators in the minority at the time ended up voting against "clean" funding bills to maintain the shutdown. Rubio also voted against the final funding bill that ended the shutdown, which Heck voted for. Our ruling Cortez Masto claimed that Heck "voted to shut down the government." Heck did vote for many pieces of legislation that technically would have funded the government, but the political reality was that all of those proposals were doomed to fail because they sought to undo at least part of the Affordable Care Act. Heck was cagey on his support for a "clean" spending bill throughout the shutdown, but did break from the majority of his party and joined with Democrats in voting for the spending bill that ended the shutdown. Because Cortez Masto is oversimplifying the issue and how Heck voted, we rate her statement as Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/373aadb6-21d8-45b1-bf07-a44bc13a55f9	None	Catherine Cortez Masto	None	None	None	2016-10-20T16:18:22	2016-10-14	['Joe_Heck']
pomt-11795	"On the personal tax side, middle-income people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts or, in certain cases, increases" under the Republican tax bills.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/20/steve-mnuchin/steve-mnuchin-uses-partial-data-say-gop-tax-bill-t/	Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, one of the White House’s leading advocates for the Republican tax bills pending in the House and Senate, took to the Sunday-morning airwaves to promote the measures. On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation on the House version of the tax bill. "They say it delivers 80 percent of its cuts to corporations, businesses, and wealthy families," Wallace said. Mnuchin responded, "Chris, these numbers are very complicated, and it depends on how you allocate them. So one of the things they're doing is they're taking a pass-through allocation, which is all about small and medium-size businesses, and they're allocating it back to the wealthy. And the same thing with the corporate tax cuts. We don't believe that." Instead, Mnuchin said, "if you look at this simply, and people just look at, are their personal taxes going up or down, on the personal tax side, middle income people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts or, in certain cases, increases." As it turns out, Mnuchin has a point that many middle-income Americans stand to benefit from the tax bills. However, his suggestion that "rich people" will somehow draw the short straw is questionable and based on a selective reading of the data. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin appeared on "Fox News Sunday" on Nov. 19, 2017. The Tax Foundation analysis The White House pointed us to analysis by the Tax Foundation, an independent group that leans conservative. Two tables -- one each for the House and Senate -- show the impact the bills would have on taxpayers in a range of income levels. For the Senate bill, the Tax Foundation model found that every income group except one -- taxpayers between the 90th and 95th percentile in income -- would see an increase in after-tax income due to the bill. That would hold for both in 2018 and in 2027. And in terms of percentage increases, some of the highest would come for groups in the middle of the income distribution. The story is much the same for the House bill. A few more upper-income groups would see incomes fall after the House bill than after the Senate bill, but the general pattern would hold -- that is, as Mnuchin said, middle-income earners would fare the best. A critical caveat That’s not the whole story, though. Remember that Mnuchin framed his statistic as referring to "the personal tax side." The data from the Tax Foundation cited above comes purely from the personal tax side. But that’s a bit cherry-picked. The House and Senate bills would not only change personal income taxes; they would also change how other types of taxes are levied, including corporate and estate taxes. "A big part of the bill is slashing taxes on business income, which disproportionately affects high-income earners, as does eventually repealing estate tax," said Len Burman, who co-founded the Tax Policy Center. Since these taxes are not factored into the personal-taxes-only data we cited above, this data underplays the positive impact the bill as a whole would have on wealthy households. Once you add in the business and estate taxes, the benefits of the bill become a lot less geared toward middle-income earners. In the Senate bill, the highest percentage increases in income would accrue to those in the top 20 percent (a 3.1 percent increase in 2018) and the top 1 percent (a 7.5 percent increase in 2018). Those two groups would also fare the best in 2027. In the House bill, the difference between middle-income and wealthier income groups is somewhat more muted, but the top 20 percent would still gain 3.6 percent in income in 2018 while the top 1 percent gained 7.5 percent that year. By 2027, the top 20 percent would gain 1.1 percent and the top 1 percent would gain 3.3 percent. The Tax Foundation report acknowledges this pattern, saying, "Much of the increase in after-tax incomes for higher-income earnings is attributable to changes in business taxation, such as the lower corporate income tax rate and the lower pass-through business income tax rate." (We also confirmed with the foundation that the estate tax is not factored into the tables reprinted above.) So, the very same report shows that the bill as a whole -- not just the personal tax changes -- is tilted a lot more heavily towards wealthier Americans than Mnuchin indicated. Other analyses Other groups paint a similar picture. It’s worth emphasizing that these other analyses show that many Americans would indeed see a tax cut under the GOP bills. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, in 2018, the 20 percent of households in the middle of the income spectrum -- known as the "middle quintile" -- would get, on average, $830 in savings, or about 1.4 percent of their income. That’s not nothing, though, contrary to what Mnuchin suggested, it’s smaller than the gains for richer Americans. The top 20 percent of households, the "top quintile," would get a $4,860 tax cut in 2018, worth about 1.9 percent of their income. And the top 1 percent would save $37,100 in 2018, or 2.4 percent of their income. By 2027, the middle quintile would see its cut shrink to $360, or 0.5 percent of their income. For the top quintile, the cuts would stay roughly similar between 2018 and 2027-- $4,590, or 1.3 percent of their income. And for the top 1 percent, the tax savings would go up by 2027, reaching $62,300, or 2.6 percent of their income. We should note that not every taxpayer in those groups would see a cut. But in all the income ranges we cited, and in both years, a clear majority of taxpayers in that income group would see a decrease, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis. Another analysis, by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, found that the $1-million-and-up income range saw an overall, cumulative cut in each of the years studied. Our ruling Mnuchin said, "On the personal tax side, middle-income people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts or, in certain cases, increases" under the Republican tax bills. Mnuchin's suggestion that middle-income Americans would do better than richer Americans stems from an analysis that looks only at the bills’ change to personal taxes, not at other types of taxes being rewritten in the bills, such as business and estate taxes. Once the proposed changes to these other taxes are taken into account, the bills’ tilt towards middle-income earners flips to become a tilt towards wealthier Americans. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Steve Mnuchin	None	None	None	2017-11-20T16:53:41	2017-11-19	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-10325	Obama "shunned the opportunity to talk to soldiers to thank them for their service."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/28/chain-email/event-was-delayed-as-group-talked-to-troops/	Just after Sen. Barack Obama visited Afghanistan during his recent trip abroad, a scathing e-mail from a captain at Bagram Air Base spread virus-style, infecting blogs and inboxes across the country. "As you know I am not a very political person," the attack begins. "I just wanted to pass along that Senator Obama came to Bagram Afghanistan for about an hour on his visit to 'The War Zone'. I wanted to share with you what happened." What happened, according to the author — who is reportedly a Utah Army National Guard intelligence officer — is that Obama went straight from his plane to a bulletproof vehicle, then to a meeting with a general, ignoring a line of soldiers waiting to shake his hand. Afterward, Obama went to the Clamshell, a recreation tent, so photographers could take pictures of him playing basketball, the e-mail says. "He again shunned the opportunity to talk to Soldiers to thank them for their service," the author wrote. "I just don't understand how anyone would want him to be our Commander-and-Chief," the self-described apolitical officer says. "It was almost that he was scared to be around those that provide the freedom for him and our great country." For good measure, he adds: "What you see in the news is all fake." ( Read the entire chain e-mail here. ) What about what you see in your inbox? We've examined chain e-mails in depth , and found a great many contain falsehoods. This is unexceptional in that regard. Obama and the two senators with him did not brush off the troops, said Capt. Christian Patterson, a spokesman for the Army's Combined Joint Task Force-101 (CJTF, in Pentagon speak) at Bagram Air Field. "There were three members of the congressional delegation and they did stop and take time to shake hands with service members here," Patterson said. In fact, briefings "were delayed as the senators took time to shake hands, speak to troops, and pose for photographs," said a press release issued by the Army. And that bit about blowing off the troops for photo ops on the basketball court? "Sen. Obama did not go to the 'Clamshell' recreational tent or play basketball during his stop here," the press release says. (Obama played basketball with troops at a prior stop in Kuwait.) "His itinerary was set by CJTF-101 prior to the visit," the press release continues. "While CJTF-101 cannot say if this blog is authentic, the comments in it are inappropriate and factually incorrect." We were unable to speak directly with the e-mail's author, identified in most versions of the e-mail and in published accounts as Capt. Jeffrey S. Porter of the 142nd Military Intelligence Battalion. Patterson said military policy prohibited him from saying whether or not a Jeffrey Porter was serving at Bagram. The Army Times reported that it corresponded with Porter, who asked them to "delete my e-mail and not forward it [because] after checking my sources some of the information that was put out in my e-mail was wrong. This e-mail was meant only for my family." The New York Daily News reported a similar exchange but did not identify the e-mail author by name. But because the military directly and unequivocally contradicted the most damaging allegations at issue — that Obama shunned troops on various occasions, including on his way to a photo opportunity on the basketball court — we rule this claim False.

pomt-02581	"The $18.8 billion in funding for K-12 education funding is the highest in Florida history and includes a record $10.6 billion in state funds."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jan/29/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-k-12-education-budget-proposal/	Gov. Rick Scott may have signed a $1.3 billion cut to K-12 education in his first year, but he’s now touting "record" funding for public schools and teacher pay raises later in his term. Scott unveiled his education budget proposal at a Delray Beach elementary school on Jan. 27, 2014. In an accompanying press release, he said, "The $18.8 billion in funding for K-12 education funding is the highest in Florida history and includes a record $10.6 billion in state funds." We wondered: If the state Legislature goes along with Scott’s request, would $18.8 billion in total -- including the state’s portion of $10.6 -- be the highest in Florida history? Let’s pull out our calculators and budget documents from past years and find out. Total dollars Scott made similar claims about proposing record K-12 education spending last year. To determine whether a budget proposal is a "record," we have to examine the total size of the pot, the state portion and the per-pupil spending. The Florida Education Finance Program, the main source of dollars for K-12 education, is by law a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars called the "required local effort," with an amount dictated by the state. In some recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars. In 2013, Scott signed a budget that included $18.3 billion for K-12 education, including the state’s contribution of $10.5 billion for 2013-14. Scott’s $18.8 billion proposal for 2014-15 -- including $10.6 billion in state dollars -- would be an increase by about $542 million in raw dollars. (Of course, we’ll have to wait to see if the Legislature goes along with that plan when it convenes in March.) But that doesn’t fully answer the question about whether Scott is on track for record K-12 education spending. Per-pupil spending That’s because another way to compare education funding over time is to look at per-pupil spending. Scott’s budget request equals $6,949 per student, compared with $6,780 this year. That means Scott requested a per-pupil increase of about $169. (That’s an estimate, since we don’t know yet how many more or fewer students the state will have next year.) The problem for Scott is that $6,949 per student is not a record for per pupil spending. A chart comparing state spending over a decade through Scott’s recommendation last year show that per-pupil funding peaked in 2007-08 -- before the recession -- at $7,126. At the time, Charlie Crist was governor; he was then a Republican and is now running as a Democrat against Scott to win his old job back. In 2007-08 Florida had about 67,000 fewer students than it does today, and the state spent more money per student. Inflation Another way to measure whether Scott is proposing a record amount of spending is to use an inflation calculator, in order to fairly compare amounts spent during different years. If we take the $9.7 billion in state spending for 2007-08 and adjust for inflation, it would equal about $10.5 billion in 2013 -- so Scott would still be correct that his proposed $10.6 billion in state spending is higher. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index inflation calculator doesn’t show 2014 yet.) But if we take the total spending for 2007-08 -- $18.75 billion -- and adjust for inflation, that would equal $20.29 billion in 2013, which is still higher than Scott’s recommendation for total spending of $18.8 billion. Our ruling Scott said of his budget proposal that "the $18.8 billion in funding for K-12 education funding is the highest in Florida history and includes a record $10.6 billion in state funds." He is correct that both the sheer dollar total and the state’s portion are larger than in past years. However, per-pupil spending was higher under Crist. Also, factoring in inflation for the total amount for 2007-08 would make it larger than Scott’s current proposal. On balance, we rate Scott’s claim Half True.

pomt-14386	Illegal "immigration is lower than it’s been in 40 years."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/mar/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-austin-says-illegal-immigration-40-ye/	Barack Obama fired up supporters at a Democratic National Committee reception in Austin by insisting the country is "pretty darn great" toward the end of his eight years as president -- despite what Republicans say. According to a White House transcript of Obama’s March 11, 2015, remarks, Obama said to applause: "You’ve got all these candidates on the other side tripping all over themselves to talk down the economy when it is the bright spot in the world economy. You’ve got folks talking about how weak America is when we're the most powerful nation on Earth." Those two judgments, you might say, are not-fact-checkable opinions. But next Obama said: "You’ve got these folks saying immigration is our biggest crisis when illegal immigration is lower than it’s been in 40 years." Republicans including prospective wall-builders Donald Trump and Ted Cruz say illegal immigration adds up to a huge crisis. So, is Obama right that illegal immigration is at a 40-year low? Experts agree that some 11 million to 12 million U.S. residents lack legal permission to live here. In July 2015, when PolitiFact Florida looked into such estimates, Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said the total number of illegal immigrants had essentially held constant in recent years, because the number arriving roughly balanced the number going home or getting legal status. For this story, we took Obama as referring to the flow of immigrants, many of them across the Rio Grande. And while it’s impossible for anyone to know the exact level of illegal immigration--most people don’t want to get caught--there are ways to gauge changes. A 2014 fact check of a similar Obama claim identified U.S. Border Patrol border apprehension statistics as the best yet imperfect indicator of changes in illegal immigration. PolitiFact Florida found Half True this Obama claim: "Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is the lowest it has been since the 1970s." Obama failed to acknowledge both that in the 1970s, it was easier for people to make multiple border crossings and that the decline in border apprehensions began before his presidency. Generally, the flows of immigrants across the border correlates with economic conditions outside the president's full control. In his Austin remarks, Obama didn’t take credit for changes in illegal immigration. Regardless, he did retread his historical comparison. PolitiFact Florida, citing Border Patrol data, found that apprehensions of individuals illegally crossing the border annually decreased from 2007 through 2011, when there were 340,252 such apprehensions. Yet the agency also reported upticks in apprehensions in both 2012 and 2013, then the latest year of available data. The latest figures After Obama spoke, we spotted Border Patrol counts indicating that in fiscal 2015, which ran through September 2015, the agency reported 337,117 "illegal alien apprehensions" nationally including 331,333 in the Southwest Border sector, which runs east from San Diego through the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Another Border Patrol chart lists the agency’s total apprehensions nationally since 1925. According to the chart, its 2015 apprehensions were the fewest since the agency reported 302,517 apprehensions in 1971, 44 years earlier. And what about apprehensions near the southern border? A Border Patrol chart listing Southwest Border apprehensions since 1960 indicates apprehensions in that sector in 2015 were the least since 2011 when there were 327,577 apprehensions. You have to go back to 1972 to find fewer border-zone apprehensions--321,326, the chart says. Caveats Obama could have added caveats to his direct comparison of apprehensions 40 years apart. As PolitiFact Florida noted, there were far fewer Border Patrol agents in the 1970s and no barriers like the fencing ordered in place by Congress in recent years. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said the lack of barriers helped lead more people to enter or attempt to enter multiple times. The fine point is that apprehensions don’t break out entirely to individuals apprehended. In this vein, a 2011 Department of Homeland Security report cautioned against presuming that apprehensions relate to a particular number of individuals. "Apprehension data... represent events, not individuals," the report said. "The total number of apprehensions during a specific period will be greater than the total number of unique individuals apprehended because some individuals will have been apprehended more than once. The relationship between the number of border apprehensions to either the number of attempted illegal entries or the number of successful illegal entries is unknown." A Georgetown University professor, Susan Martin, previously told PolitiFact too that with the addition of fencing and more agents in more recent years, people use smugglers to cross the border, which is more expensive and results in less traffic. In the 1990s, the U.S. strategy changed from trying to apprehend as many people as possible to trying to deter them from entering, Martin said. Federal officials used sensors, cameras and other technology to identify recidivists and get a better sense of the actual numbers. Administration response We asked the White House how Obama reached his conclusion. After we’d looked at government apprehension figures, we heard back from Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard who sent an email stressing Southwest sector apprehensions: "Over the last 15 years, our Nation – across multiple administrations -- has invested a lot in border security, and this investment has yielded positive results. Apprehensions – which are an indicator of total attempts to cross the border illegally – are a fraction of what they used to be. "In FY 2014, overall apprehensions increased, as we saw a spike in the number of families and unaccompanied children from Central America during the spring and summer of 2014. That year the overall number of apprehensions was 479,000. Across the government, we responded aggressively to this surge and the numbers fell sharply within a short period of time. "In FY 2015, the number of those apprehended on the southwest border was 331,000 – with the exception of one year, this was the lowest number since 1972." Our ruling Obama said illegal "immigration is lower than it’s been in 40 years." Worth noting: There’s no direct indicator of illegal immigration. Folks don’t report in. But the best-available metric, Border Patrol apprehensions, reached a 44-year national low in 2015. Still, apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border were even lower four years before. The previous Southwest sector low occurred in 1972. Significantly too, Obama didn’t claim credit for this change. We rate his Austin statement Mostly True.

pomt-05339	Says in regard to providing "more tax cuts for the rich," Bill Pascrell said, "Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/14/steve-rothman/steve-rothmans-campaign-edits-hardball-interview-b/	The latest attack ad from U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman has all the makings of a well-crafted, political hit. There’s the snarky narrator, a tuxedoed man winking at the camera -- and, of course, some editing to make Rothman’s opponent sound like he’s saying something that he’s not. About a month before the two Democratic congressmen face off in the June 5 primary for a newly drawn congressional district, Rothman’s campaign on May 8 posted an ad on YouTube claiming that U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell "wants more tax cuts for the rich." The ad goes one step further, suggesting that Pascrell admitted to supporting such tax cuts. Just after the narrator claims the congressman "wants more tax cuts for the rich," the video cuts to a clip of Pascrell saying, "Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas." But PolitiFact New Jersey found that Pascrell’s comments were in reference to reaching a bipartisan compromise on health care reform, not about providing tax cuts. Let’s go through the ad. The ad opens with a video of Rothman saying, "I’m Steve Rothman and I approved this message." Then we see archival footage of what appears to be wealthy people in tuxedos and cocktail dresses at a party. "Who wants more tax cuts for the rich?" the narrator intones. "Mitt Romney, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich and Bill Pascrell." A photo of each man is superimposed on the screen as the narrator says their names. The ad immediately turns to a video of Pascrell talking. In a clip from an interview on MSNBC’s "Hardball with Chris Matthews," Pascrell says, "Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas." The ad abruptly turns to the winking, tuxedoed man as the narrator adds: "Especially if you’re wealthy." The three-second clip featured in Rothman’s ad was pulled from a nearly eight-minute "Hardball" interview from Jan. 25, 2010. During that segment, Pascrell was discussing health care reform, not tax cuts. In response to Matthews’ question about reaching a bipartisan deal on health care reform, here is Pascrell’s complete answer: "I really believe that it can happen. And I believe that the president should try again to reach out to the other side. I know he tried to do (it) in the beginning. Mr. Boehner, who’s the leader (of the) Republicans in the House, he chose the path of saying, ‘Nah, our party’s not gonna support any of this.’ And it really puts the pressure on anybody on the other side who wants to think of some good (ideas). Republicans had great ideas. We had some bipartisan meetings...I liked some of their ideas, and they liked some of our ideas." To read a transcript of the entire interview or watch it, go here. So, Rothman is clearly wrong to suggest Pascrell was endorsing "more tax cuts for the rich," when his statement was about Republicans’ ideas for health care reform. Paul Swibinski, a senior adviser to the Rothman campaign, acknowledged in an e-mail that the clip was about health care, but argued it reinforces how "Bill Pascrell has often caved in to Republicans and negotiated away what progressives stand for." Pascrell spokesman Sean Darcy responded in an e-mail: "Steve Rothman's claims to being a progressive fighter fly in the face of the facts and his constant negative attacks against Bill Pascrell have been consistently, directly contradicted by independent verifiers." Our ruling In an attack ad from Rothman’s campaign, the narrator claims Pascrell "wants more tax cuts for the rich." Then the video suggests Pascrell admitted to supporting such tax cuts by showing a clip of him saying, "Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas." But when Pascrell made those comments during a "Hardball" interview, the congressman was discussing efforts to reach a bipartisan compromise on health care reform. In fact, the phrase "tax cuts" was never mentioned during the entire interview. Editing a political ad to distort the meaning behind an opponent’s comments is not just wrong, it’s ridiculous.

pomt-05870	"This year’s redistricting has been the most open, interactive and transparent redistricting process in Tennessee history."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/feb/10/ron-ramsey/senate-speaker-repeatedly-claims-2012-redistrictin/	It was Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey’s mantra – Open! Transparent! – from Jan. 4 when state legislative redistricting plans were first made public through Jan. 13 when they won final legislative approval. Starting last year, Republican legislative leaders drove home their message that their first time in complete charge of redistricting in Tennessee would result in political boundaries that were "legal and fair" and that the process would be "the most open, interactive and transparent…in Tennessee history." Ramsey said so in various forms -- in a Jan. 4 press release, again nine days later when it passed and again in an email Jan. 27 announcing that street-level maps for the districts were available. Mark Norris, the Senate Republican majority leader from Collierville, backed up his speaker on Jan. 10 when he presented details of the redistricting plans to the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first time, "It’s been an open process." Despite the rhetoric, Jan. 27 was the first moment in the five-month process of drawing and approving new districts that Tennesseans could zoom in on their homes on the Internet and -- particularly for those living near district boundaries -- determine precisely which state House, Senate and congressional districts they’ll be voting in for the next 10 years. That was two weeks after the maps were adopted – too late to contact legislators or appear before a committee to try to alter the outcome. Maps posted Jan. 4 and Jan. 6 were broader "concept" maps with no street-level views. To nobody’s surprise, Democrats accustomed to running redistricting the previous four decades were outraged -- none more so than Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen, who said he was blindsided by the Republican decision to partition Memphis. The Democratic-backed Tennessee Citizen Action called the process "as transparent as a smoke-filled room." But nonpartisan groups like the League of Women Voters of Tennessee, an organization that encourages informed participation in government, cried foul on what it called the Republicans’ "take it or leave it plan." The League said the process "certainly lacks transparency and accountability. We do not … necessarily believe this process is worse than previous legislative efforts. We do believe, however, that the secret discussions which lead to this ‘take it or leave it plan’ do not serve the public interest." It’s worth noting here that 21 states have created various kinds of independent, bipartisan redistricting commissions the League prefers, but Tennessee has avoided that approach. Dick Williams, president of the citizens’ action group Common Cause of Tennessee, said the 2011-12 redistricting process "was a mixed bag. I couldn't say it was the most open but I wouldn't say it was the least open either. They did set up a process where people could comment but did not make anything available until the last minute about their plans. And for the public to submit any significant suggestions, they had to submit maps for the whole state. The public and even Democratic legislators, except for some information about their individual districts, had very little information until the last week or so of voting on the bills." Williams a volunteer legislative lobbyist for his organization since the 1970s, said the bottom line is that despite "some aspects" being "a little more open," he believes "it's a stretch to claim that this was the most open process." Ramsey’s contention that the current redistricting was the most open in Tennessee history spans 216 years of statehood, but we need focus only on the last 50 years because the legislature ignored constitutional mandates until courts forced it to redistrict every 10 years starting in the 1960s. We went to hard-copy clip archives of The Commercial Appeal and the Knoxville News Sentinel to review news coverage of the legislature’s redistricting efforts of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. To be sure, the articles underscore that the work of actually drawing the initial maps presented for legislative debate often occurred behind closed doors. But once those first maps were unveiled in each of the previous cycles, there was far more public give and take in the legislative committees and on the House and Senate floors – sometimes drawn out over weeks and months -- than what we saw last month. We found that for each of those decades, there are thick stacks of articles filled with coverage of committee and floor debates and public hearings. Adam Kleinheider, a spokesman for Ramsey, sent us an email that pointed to an initiative by the House and Senate that gave citizens with online access the basic population data and guidelines citizens needed to draw and submit new maps. "In previous redistricting cycles, only a handful of Tennesseans had access to redistricting data and software," he said. Kleinheider blamed Democrats for not participating, saying they did not submit ideas until the "last hour of debate on the floor." He says "some of the Democrats’ better ideas" were incorporated, that it passed on a "bipartisan vote" and that even Nashville’s Democratic Congressman, Jim Cooper, offered praise for "open-mindedness" on the congressional map. "This redistricting process gave every Tennessean, and every legislator, the opportunity to be involved -- and let good ideas rise to the top," Kleinheider said. But Kleinheider glosses over requirements for public participation that seem burdensome for even the savviest of citizens; as Common Cause noted, you had to submit technical maps for the entire state -- not just a suggestion that your community be kept intact in the same district. Some other factors to consider: --Ramsey appointed only three Senate Republican leaders to draw the Senate maps, a partisan committee that he chaired. His predecessor, the late Speaker John Wilder, in the two previous cycles appointed bipartisan committees (four Democrats and three Republicans in 1991, three Democrats and two Republicans in 2001), meaning that the minority party had participated and was privy to the details. When the Ramsey-appointed, all-GOP Senate panel made public its 2012 plan on Jan. 4, most Democratic senators and some Republicans had not seen it. --The state House and congressional district boundaries were also drawn by small, all-GOP committees. House Democrats were shown only "concept maps" of their individual districts, but not statewide plans. --Except for the first organizational meetings of the House and Senate redistricting committees, none of the work of the committees occurred in public. The maps unveiled on Jan. 4 and Jan. 6 were the first seen by the public. --Lawmakers rushed to passage this year in record time, with little time for public review and input. The legislative maps were unveiled Jan. 4, the congressional maps Jan. 6, and all three were approved Jan. 13. Even Ramsey acknowledged that he did not meet his promise last fall that the new maps would be released by early December. Ironically, in the last redistricting a decade ago, Republican officials led by Memphis lawyer John Ryder filed a federal court lawsuit on Aug. 30, 2001, asking that a panel of federal judges draw new district lines by Nov. 1, 2001, because passage of new maps in early 2002 would leave the public and potential candidates too little time before the candidate qualifying deadline. The lawsuit was dismissed but there was slightly more time for public review in that cycle than there was in this year’s. Our ruling Based on a close review of past redistricting -- which has always been much more of an insider’s game than it should be -- Ramsey’s basic claim that the process was more open, transparent and interactive than any in state history does not hold up. No matter how many times he repeats it, Ramsey’s statement remains False.	None	Ron Ramsey	None	None	None	2012-02-10T04:30:00	2012-01-27	['Tennessee']
pomt-06254	Georgia is one of seven states to lose jobs in 2011 and has lost 8,200 jobs so far.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/30/eric-gray/georgia-job-loss-claim-money/	Georgia Democrats are apparently following the Republican Party playbook on the economic blame game. Over the past year, GOP leaders have blamed President Barack Obama, a Democrat, for the nation’s high unemployment rate and other fiscal troubles. In Georgia, Democrats are criticizing Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, who took office in January, for some of this state’s economic problems. Eric Gray, the communications director of the Georgia Democratic Party, attempted to make the case at a news conference in Augusta. Deal made promises to create jobs and hasn’t delivered, Gray said. "I challenge him to show us where those jobs are," Gray was quoted as saying in the Augusta Chronicle. Here’s the part that piqued our interest. The newspaper paraphrased Gray as saying Georgia is one of only seven states to lose jobs this year. The grand total of jobs lost? About 8,200, Gray said. Most economists define job creation as a net increase in the number of people employed between one time frame and another and job losses as a net decrease between two periods of time. In January, about 3,806,600 Georgians were employed, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the main source economists and others use to track employment data. In September, the most recent month available when Gray made his comments, the number of Georgians employed dropped to an estimated 3,798,400. The difference: 8,200 jobs. The September estimate has been readjusted by the BLS to an estimated 3,797,500, which is a 9,100 job difference. Through September, there were about 3,200 fewer people employed in manufacturing than there were at the beginning of the year and about 5,000 fewer Georgians in the financial activities industry. The biggest change was in government, where there were nearly 18,000 fewer Georgians employed. Gray told us via email that "government losses are indeed still job losses." There’s been a slight increase so far this year in the number of Georgians employed in construction, education and health services and in the category of leisure and hospitality, according to the federal data. In October, the most recent month available, there were about 3,800,100 Georgians employed, a slight uptick from September. The October estimate is still less than the total in January. Now, how many other states have lost jobs since the beginning of the year? Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Vermont and Virginia lost jobs, according to the BLS. Including Georgia, that adds up to seven states. In Georgia, the initial job loss estimate of 8,200 was a reduction of 0.2 percent. The job loss difference was greatest in Delaware, 0.6 percent. It may seem premature to say Deal has not done enough to create more jobs in nine months. The claims that Gray made were correct on both points. But there is this caveat: Many of the job losses were in government and not the private sector. Gray’s statement is accurate but needs more context. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-02468	Rhode Island is "almost dead last" among Northeastern states in the length of time first-degree murderers must spend in prison before they’re eligible for parole.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/feb/22/leonidas-raptakis/rep-leonidas-raptakis-ri-murderers-parole-wait-sho/	Rhode Island state Sen. Leonidas Raptakis, D-Coventry, wants to know: What is the meaning of life? At least when it comes to sentencing someone to prison. That’s because in Rhode Island, as in many other states, there are two types of life sentences. There is life without parole, which is levied after a special hearing held by the judge in the case after the initial trial. And there is a life sentence that allows inmates to seek parole after serving a certain number of years, depending on the crime. Raptakis is pressing for a bill in the current General Assembly session that would make inmates who are serving a life sentence for first-degree murder wait 30 years before being eligible for parole, instead of the current 20. At the Feb. 11 news conference where he unveiled his proposed legislation, Raptakis argued that Rhode Island’s 20-year wait is lenient compared with other Northeastern states -- the "bottom of the barrel," he said. Later, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, he said Rhode Island was "dead last" among the states in the northeastern United States. So, are Rhode Island’s laws on parole eligibility guilty as charged? At his news conference, Raptakis handed out a map listing the first-degree murder penalties in 12 states, from Virginia to Maine, and the District of Columbia. (Technically, not all of the states he mentioned are considered Northeastern by the Census Bureau, although they are included in other definitions of the region.) Raptakis said he got his information from Wikipedia. To check, we went to the websites of each of the 12 states and the District of Columbia and read their criminal statutes for life sentences for first-degree murder. Only Rhode Island and Virginia allowed first-degree murderers to seek parole after 20 years. In Connecticut, Maine and New York, they become eligible after 25 years. In New Jersey and the District of Columbia, they are eligible after 30 years, in Vermont after 35. In five other states -- Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Hampshire -- first-degree murderers are not eligible for parole. Our ruling State Sen. Leonidas Raptakis said Rhode Island is "almost dead last" among Northeastern states in the amount of time first-degree murderers must serve before they are eligible for parole. When we examined the statutes in each of the states he cited, we found that all except Virginia have stricter sentencing requirements than Rhode Island. We rule his claim True.

pomt-01341	None of $400 million the City of Austin proposes to spend on road projects "will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways."	false	/texas/statements/2014/oct/23/citizens-against-rail-taxes/anti-rail-group-incorrect-city-proposition-envisio/	Perhaps you’ve heard: The City of Austin promises that if voters sign off on a rail proposition, $400 million in city-issued debt will separately flow to road projects in the traffic-glutted capital. The city says on a web page describing its proposition on the November 2014 ballot the "roadway improvement projects are designed to relieve congestion, enhance mobility and manage traffic in nine "corridors" including Interstate 35. Hold your applause, one group says. In a radio ad, a narrator for Citizens Against Rail Taxes says the rail part of the plan won’t relieve congestion. "And the $400 million the city is promising us for road projects?" the narrator says. "Guess how much of that money will be used to add new lanes to our congested roadways. None. Zero." Nothing? By phone, Jim Skaggs, the group’s treasurer, pointed out the ad specifies no new lanes on the city’s "congested" roads. That was a wave, he said, at the routinely clogged MoPac Boulevard, I-35 and U.S. 183. "There’s some frontage road stuff" in the proposal, Skaggs said. "But they’re not adding any lane-miles to our really crowded highways," he said. Government officials and lane-miles When we inquired, officials for the city and Texas Department of Transportation each said that contrary to the claim, the described $400 million would result in about 15 miles of new or extended lanes or what engineers call lane-miles, which is a calculation of area based on how much pavement is added, perhaps not always what a motorist thinks of when he or she imagines fresh pavement. Specifically, city spokeswoman Samantha Alexander said, some of the promised spending would go to projects related to easing access to and from I-35 just south of Lady Bird Lake and there also would be projects related to Texas 71 -- plus a single new lane on part of FM 1826 in Southwest Austin, among examples. The 2014 Austin Strategic Mobility Plan, adopted by the Austin City Council in June 2014, has a chart summarizing how $400 million might be spent: Source: City of Austin, 2014 Strategic Mobility Plan (downloaded Oct. 10, 2014) We asked TxDOT to illuminate details. By email, spokeswoman Kelli Reyna provided a breakdown indicating 10.5 miles of the lane-miles would be adjacent to I-35 near Riverside Drive, Oltorf Street or William Cannon Drive. At first, we got the impression most of these projects, costing around $200 million, would simply expand frontage roads or lanes designed to ease traffic more quickly from the highway to city streets. By phone, Steve Miller, a consultant to TxDOT on the I-35 projects, counseled otherwise. About seven of the additional lane-miles Miller spelled out include: --Two added lanes, one northbound and one southbound, making it possible for drivers to enter and leave I-35 without facing the traffic signal on Riverside; --A lane added, on southbound and northbound I-35, between the exit and entry ramps under Oltorf, easing traffic off and on the highway in both directions plus a lane added in each direction making it easier to get to and from Ben White Boulevard from Oltorf; --Lanes added easing the flow of traffic from the Ben White southbound direct connectors -- or flyover -- south past William Cannon and an additional lane going north from south of Stassney Lane to the flyover that reaches Ben White. Also in both directions, lanes would be added to ease traffic from exit and entry ramps to and from East Stassney Lane and William Cannon. The TxDOT breakdown also indicates about 3.9 lane-miles would be added off of U.S. 183 and Texas 71 to improve the flow of traffic heading east toward the Austin airport. Finally, the breakdown says, a mile-long lane would be added to FM 1826 in Southwest Austin. According to an Oct. 4, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news story, this lane would be added between Slaughter Lane and U.S. 290. Terry McCoy, TxDOT’s deputy district engineer for the Austin office, said the ultimate plan is to build four lanes, with a median or left-turn lane in the middle, but the city money might be enough for only an interim three-lane version. We shared the TxDOT breakdown with Skaggs, who said the intended projects don’t attack major congested roadways. "They are frontage-road connections, intersection overpasses and connectors to 71 and 183 at the airport which," Skaggs said by email, "are not congestion priorities." Another perspective For another perspective, we turned to the Transportation Policy Research Center, part of the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University. By email, the center’s director, Ginger Goodin, called lane-miles a legitimate measure of cumulative improvements before saying she sees the projects that would be funded by the $400 million as adding lanes and relieving congestion. Goodin noted the portion of I-35 between U.S. 290 and Texas 71 ranks No. 2 on the state’s list of 100 most-congested roadways. Goodin said, too, the described projects -- including so-called collector-distributor roads, auxiliary lanes and intersection improvements -- are accepted congestion-reducing strategies recognized by the institute. Overall, Goodin called the statement by Citizens Against Rail Taxes "misleading. A portion of the funding will go toward adding lanes to IH-35, the most congested roadway in the region," Goodin said. Our ruling Citizens Against Rail Taxes said none of $400 million the City of Austin proposes to spend on road projects "will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways." There are other ways to say that six-lane I-35 won’t become a 10-lane highway under the $400 million plan. But Citizens Against Rail Taxes’ radio ad relies on all-or-nothing wording that ignores the miles of new roadway to be built with the money, much of it intended to relieve congestion in notorious trouble spots.

CLARIFICATIONS, 10:30 a.m., Oct. 23, 2014 and 12:45 p.m., Oct. 27, 2014: Part of this story was amended to clarify specifics about what lanes would be added near and on I-35 under the city's plans should voters approve the proposition We later added the detail about the cost of the described projects being about $200 million.

pomt-06035	New energy standards will take away "our freedom of choice and selection in the light bulbs we have in our homes."	mostly false	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/13/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-says-she-battling-freedom-choice-/	U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., has been on a crusade to, as she put it on the House floor in July, prevent higher efficiency standards for light bulbs from creating "a de facto ban on the incandescent bulb." In an appearance on the Fox Business Channel in December, she re-calibrated her rhetorical salvo when she told Stuart Varney she’s fighting "to keep our freedom of choice and selection in the light bulbs we have in our homes." Like many critics of the higher efficiency standards, which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2007, Blackburn said she was concerned with government limiting consumer choice. The House voted 233-193 in July to repeal the higher standards but the measure failed to get the two-thirds majority necessary to fast-track the bill to the House floor. The Obama administration issued a statement before the vote that said consumers still have freedom of choice under the law. "Any type of bulb can be sold as long as it meets the efficiency requirements. In sum, the bill would hinder an opportunity to save American consumers money, while enhancing energy efficiency and reducing harmful emissions associated with energy production." Supporters of the standards say the higher-efficiency bulbs mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act not only save energy but, despite higher up-front costs, save consumers money over time because the bulbs last longer. So does the imposition of higher energy standards amount to a "de facto ban" on incandescent bulbs? Does it strip away "our freedom of choice and selection in the light bulbs we have in our homes?" The short answer is no. Existing inefficient bulbs will stay in circulation and will continue to be sold to consumers until supplies run out. And while traditional tungsten-element bulbs can’t meet the higher standards and will not be manufactured, light bulb companies are continuing to make incandescent halogen bulbs, although they are more expensive than incandescent tungsten. So the only way you could consider there to be a ban would be if you couldn't afford the halogen bulbs. The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that supports the higher standards, points out that the trade association for domestic light manufacturers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, which would appear to have an interest in a banning of its products, has embraced the increased efficiency standards. The NRDC also notes that a factory in St. Marys, Pa., is retooling to make more efficient incandescent bulbs, creating domestic jobs. In perhaps the most telling endorsement of the higher standards, Barry Edison Sloane, the great-grandson of the inventor of the incandescent bulb, Thomas Edison, called those who sought their repeal "narrow-minded." Consumers Union, which produces Consumer Reports, also endorses the higher standards. Asked for source material, Blackburn’s spokesman Mike Reynard said: "It’s a de facto ban because traditional incandescent light bulbs can’t meet the new energy standards. An American innovation may be able to create a new incandescent bulb 2.0 -- which can meet the new standards -- but it won’t be the incandescent bulb your parents grew up with." Traditional 100-watt incandescent bulbs would have been the first to fail to meet the new standards that were to have taken effect Jan. 1. Congress in late December effectively delayed that until October 2012. Other traditional incandescents will fail to meet the lumens-per-watt standard between then and 2014, when the standard for 40-watt bulbs kicks in. Several kinds of incandescent bulbs within those wattage ranges are exempt from the new standards, including appliance bulbs, colored bulbs and stage lighting in theaters. PolitiFact has checked many other assertions regarding the light bulb controversy, finding a claim by the conservative political action committee AmeriPAC that "you will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs" to be a "Pants on Fire"-level misrepresentation. Others have been equally misleading, particularly Varney, who can be found in a 2009 debate with environmentalist actor Ed Begley Jr. stating: "The government is telling me I may not have incandescent lights." Our ruling Blackburn has been more careful in qualifying the language she uses to advance her cause. Because the standards will ultimately bring about the end of traditional incandescent bulbs, there is an element of truth in Blackburn’s claims. But consumers will still have plenty of choice of different types of bulbs, even if traditional incandescents are not for sale. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-04798	"Clayton County Public Schools recently achieved a milestone that has eluded other metropolitan districts across the state" by meeting federal guidelines for having a highly qualified staff.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/22/clayton-county-schools/clayton-schools-claim-high-status/	It’s the beginning of a new school year, and for one local school district, that meant time to do some bragging. Clayton County officials recently sent out a press release with a claim that a PolitiFact Georgia reader asked us to read and grade. "Clayton County Public Schools recently achieved a milestone that has eluded other metropolitan districts across the state," it read. "When school opens on August 13, Clayton County will have a 100 percent Highly Qualified Staff." The school district has had some rough times in recent years. Its accreditation was revoked in 2008, thanks to infighting among school board members. It was fully restored in May 2011. The district’s teachers had little to do with those problems, but PolitiFact Georgia and others still wondered about the accuracy of this claim. It’s pretty tough to get 100 percent on any exam. How about claiming all of its estimated 3,300 teachers are highly qualified? Another question we had is whether this distinction has eluded other districts. First, what does it mean to be a Highly Qualified teacher? As part of the No Child Left Behind education regulations that became law during the administration of President George W. Bush, the states were asked to have their teachers meet certain guidelines that show they are highly qualified to be in the classroom. To be deemed highly qualified, teachers must: 1) have a bachelor's degree 2) have full state certification or licensure 3) prove that they know each subject they teach The first criteria for Highly Qualified status, a bachelor’s degree, appears standard these days. In fact, the bar seems to be what percentage of teachers have a master’s degree. In 1999, virtually all public school teachers had at least a bachelor's degree, and 42 percent had a master’s degree, according to the National Science Board. In 2011, New York City reported that at least 75 percent of its eighth-grade teachers have a master’s degree. The percentage of Georgia public school teachers not fully certified in 2010-2011 was 9 percent in math and 9.7 percent in science, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2011, citing the Georgia Professional Standards Commission. It seems, though, many teachers have trouble passing the test, which some say is not meant to be rigorous. Channel 2 Action News reported last year that 12,455 teachers failed at least one part of the Georgia Assessment for the Certification of Educators test, 708 people failed five times or more and 56 had failed 10 times or more. One teacher failed 18 times. Some Georgia teaching advocates counter that the percentage of failures is small. The Highly Qualified status has not been so highly regarded in some parts of the country. In 2011, a federal circuit court ruled that California illegally classified thousands of teachers in training as "highly qualified" in violation of the federal No Child Left Behind Act, The Associated Press reported. The lawsuit, filed by some civil rights activists, claimed more than 100,000 intern teachers nationwide are classified as "highly qualified." Clayton district spokesman David Waller said teacher interns are not a part of its Highly Qualified staff. Clayton school district officials have been trying to have all of their teachers meet the guidelines since 2002 and began to aggressively recruit teachers who meet the Highly Qualified standards about five years ago. The Georgia Professional Standards Commission tracks which school districts have met the Highly Qualified criteria. During the 2010-11 school year, which was the most recent year available, 99.56 of Clayton’s teachers and paraprofessionals met all three criteria, the state said. Clayton officials forwarded us an email sent earlier this month from a commission official congratulating the district for reaching the 100 percent plateau for the 2011-12 school year. Clayton is not the first metro Atlanta school district to reach 100 percent Highly Qualified status. In the 2010-11 school year, the others were Forsyth County Schools, Decatur City Schools and Marietta City Schools. Clayton, with nearly 51,000 students, has more students than the others. Other districts in metro Atlanta area were close, said Anne Marie Fenton, the state agency’s assessment program director. Gwinnett County Schools, which has more students than any district in the state, had 99.84 percent of its teachers and paraprofessionals who met the Highly Qualified status. Cobb County also came real close, at 99.41 percent, the state said. While pleased with the ranking, Waller said the press release certainly wasn’t intended to disparage other districts. Waller said he was aware that there have been other districts that have met the guidelines. "It was not intended to imply no one else has done this," he said. Clayton did meet the 100 percent threshold for this school year, as the press release said. There are other metro districts that have come very, very close, but have not reached that mark yet. We rate this claim True.	None	Clayton County Schools	None	None	None	2012-08-22T06:00:00	2012-07-26	['None']
pomt-15362	Replacing 100,000 old toilets with water-efficient models has saved 2.4 million gallons of water every day.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/07/metropolitan-north-georgia-water-planning-district/agency-says-low-flow-toilets-saving-millions-gallo/	Even if Georgia were, ahem, flush with water, the number would have looked impressive. The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District recently celebrated its rebate program that has helped homeowners replace 100,000 older model toilets with water efficient models across the 15-county metro Atlanta region. The total savings: 2.4 million gallons of water every day. "One of the beautiful things about changing out a toilet is you get a rebate, but you also permanently save on your water bill," said Katherine Zitsch, the water district’s director. "It’s not behavior based. You do what you normally do and you get those savings for as long as the toilet lasts." And considering the water saved would fill the Georgia Aquarium 90 times a year – clearly nothing to poo poo – PolitiFact Georgia decided to dive in. Going with the flow Today’s toilet regulations date back to the 1992 Energy Policy Act, which required toilets to use 1.6 gallons of water per flush, versus the then-common 3.5-gallon models (and even older models that used as much as 8-gallons for every push of the handle). Early savings didn’t materialize because manufacturers did little more than halve the water used in a flush. Irate homeowners in news stories from the mid-Clinton years griped about having to flush multiple times to get the job done. "Plumbers were installing and changing out toilets and handing people plungers," said Ellen Whitaker, executive director of the Plumbing and Mechanical Association of Georgia. "It was as bad as it sounds. It just didn’t work. We don’t see those complaints anymore." Technology wiped out those early problems. High-pressure gadgets, and even vacuum toilets with suction that rivals airplane lavatories, have made it possible for high-efficiency models to use just 1.28 gallons per flush. That lower number qualifies commodes for the WaterSense designation. The privately verified seal, similar to Energy Star ratings for electrical appliances, confirms toilets, faucets and showerheads are the most water-efficient on the market. Exchange of Thrones The water planning district started its toilet rebate program in 2007, well into the era of high-tech toilets but also in the midst of back-to-back droughts in Georgia. Local water utilities fund and run the program, rebating $100 on water bills when homeowners show they have replaced an older toilet with a water-efficient model. Most utilities will offer rebates for up to two toilets, though some will rebate three. The planning district has kept track of the number of toilets – as well as whether the new models are the 1.28-gallon or 1.6-gallon model.. But the district has been conservative in estimating the water saved, counting only one toilet per household, even in situations where records show more than one throne was exchanged. The district then multiplies the water saved per toilet by what its partner, the Atlanta Regional Commission, shows is the average household size in a community. Using a small jurisdiction like Bartow County, which exchanged WaterSense toilets in 49 homes, the math looks like this: Step 1: 3.5 gallon minus 1.28 gallon = 2.22 gallons per toilet. Step 2: 2.22 gallons times 49 households = 108.78 gallons Step 3: 108.78 gallons times 5 flushes = 543.9 gallons per day Step 4: 2.71 average home size times 543.9 gallons = 1,474 gallons per day Bartow also had one home that received a 1.6 gallon toilet. Using the same formula, that translates into 25 gallons a day. The water district rounded up, showing 1,500 gallons per day of savings in Bartow. Similar calculations were done across the region, to arrive at the 2.4 million gallons total, said Paul Donsky, spokesman for the ARC. Cobb and DeKalb counties, which account for 15 percent and 20 percent of the totals exchanged, run their own programs and calculate the totals slightly differently. DeKalb, for instance, assumes 10 flushes per day per toilet, not per person. That translates into more gallons but overall, fewer flushes. The Environmental Protection Agency’s WaterSense calculator uses yet another similar but not quite exact formula for its estimates. That calculator factors in 5.05 flushes per day, showing that a two-person home that switches to a WaterSense model, would save 8,200 gallons of water annually. The water planning district’s math is more conservative. Using the formula, the district arrives an estimate of annual savings of 8,103 gallons. "They are all estimates but show our effort to reduce water use," said Jennifer Colaizzi, the EPA’s WaterSense spokeswoman. "We want to encourage people to use water more efficiently." To that end, the water district notes there has not been a slowdown in the number of people seeking and getting the toilet rebate. The program is expected to continue until most homes use the newer, water-sipping flushes. Our ruling The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District recently touted that the region saves 2.4 million gallons of water every day, based on its toilet rebate that has replaced 100,000 commodes with more efficient models. That’s enough to fill 1,363 Olympic-size swimming pools every year. But the district’s own math backs it up. And a comparable federal calculator shows that the district is being conservative in estimating the region’s move toward water efficiency. We rate the claim True.

pomt-11018	"Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/05/diamond-and-silk/no-evidence-obama-secretly-granted-citizenship-250/	President Donald Trump repeated a viral claim from conservative media that President Barack Obama granted U.S. citizenship to 2,500 Iranians, including family members of government officials, as part of the Iran nuclear agreement reached in 2015. "Iranian Official Drops Bombshell: Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal," said a July 2 headline on Diamond and Silk, who are pro-Trump activists. Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story was largely lifted from Fox News and repeated by Trump and other websites. "Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?" tweeted Trump, who announced in May that the United States was pulling out of the agreement to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. We found that the claim lacks evidence. Our fact-checking friends at Factnameh, a Canada-based website that fact-checks claims about Iran, found that the statement by the Iranian official has no evidence to back it up. Factnameh.com found that the original source of the claim was an anti-regime website called Amad News. It published the claim on Feb. 14, 2017, quoting an anonymous "informed source." Fox News attributed report to one Iranian official Fox News attributed its report to Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, chairman of Iran’s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee. Zolnour made the allegations during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s Fars News agency, a "semi-official" organ of the Iranian government. Zolnour claimed that the citizenships were granted as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, Fox said. "When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly referred to as the Iran deal), decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians," he claimed. Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told Fox News, "This sounds like totally made up B.S." Other officials in the Obama administration also said the statement was false. Richard Nephew, who works for Columbia University and was the State Department’s lead sanctions expert from August 2013 to December 2014, told PolitiFact that the claim "is entirely nonsense." "It would have made no sense for us to have done this and less sense for the officials to have agreed/requested citizenship," he said. "While I was on the team, this wasn't even discussed, considered or thought about. I would bet any sum you'd care to wager that this didn't come up after I left the talks. And, it is worth noting that after years of congressional inquiry into this, we never heard of it. I find it hard to believe that's because this one opposition politician in Iran was the only person who knew about it." Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, who served on State’s Policy Planning Staff from 2005-07, also expressed disbelief. (She held a part-time outside advisor role during the early part of Obama’s administration.) Maloney said the issue of U.S. citizenship or green cards has long been a contentious one within the Iranian establishment. There are a few Iranians within the ruling establishment who have or had U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, typically dating from the pre-revolutionary period. There are also Iranian officials whose children have attended U.S. universities and stayed in the United States, or married dual nationals and obtained residency or citizenship. "Given the longstanding estrangement between the U.S. and Iran, the allegation alone is used as a smear, to impugn the patriotism and question the motives of rival officials by essentially accusing them of hypocrisy and ideological opportunism," she said. Zolnour is a hard-line cleric, she said. "So it’s not surprising that a politician who is critical of the nuclear deal would use this line of attack, especially in the aftermath of President Trump’s dismantling of the deal, which has generated an intense backlash toward the proponents of the agreement," Maloney said. "And yes, Iranians of all political stripes are prone to indulging fairly creative conspiracy theories, especially hardliners and especially conspiracy theories about the U.S." Ali Vaez, the anti-war Crisis Group's Iran Project Director, told PoltiiFact that Zolnour is a firebrand who is well known for his false claims. Vaez said that Zolnour is using this claim to undermine President Hassan Rouhani and his allies as the parliament is trying to pass a bill to ban dual-nationals from serving in the Iranian government. We emailed the Diamond and Silk website and did not get a reply. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment to Fox News, and we didn’t get a reply to our email. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert was asked about Trump’s tweet at the July 3 press briefing and referred reporters to homeland security. Our ruling A headline on a Diamond and Silk website said "Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal." The article stemmed from a Fox News report which was based on comments by Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, an Iranian official, who made the allegation during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s semi-official Fars News agency. The report doesn’t appear to include any actual evidence. Fox News’ report contained no confirmation by U.S. government officials working in the Trump administration.

pomt-13975	There is "no system to vet" refugees from the Middle East.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/13/donald-trump/wrong-donald-trump-says-theres-no-system-vet-refug/	Blaming the Orlando massacre on the country’s "failed immigration system," Donald Trump equated refugee admission to a "better, bigger, more horrible version of the legendary Trojan horse." Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, vowed to suspend immigration from "areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States" in his speech on terrorism and immigration. "Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children," Trump said June 13. "The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen." We examinef the number of refugees Clinton wants to admit in a separate fact-check, but here we’ll look at whether there really is "no system to vet them." This is an exaggeration, and one we’ve heard before. While Trump has a point that the system isn’t foolproof, there is a system. It has been in place for over three decades and was retooled after 9/11. The system (which exists) and how it works The vetting begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee, which determines who counts as a refugee, who should be resettled (about 1 percent) and which countries would take them. This alone can take four to 10 months. If the UNHCR refers refugees to the United States, they then face scrutiny from federal intelligence and security agencies. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through federal terrorism and criminal databases. Meanwhile, the refugees are interviewed by Department of Homeland Security officials. If approved, they then undergo a medical screening, a match with sponsor agencies, "cultural orientation" classes and one final security clearance. Syrian refugees in particular must clear one additional hurdle. Their documents are placed under extra scrutiny and cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information. The process typically takes one to two years or longer and happens before a refuge ever steps onto American soil. Ultimately, says the State Department, about half are approved, and there’s no real precedent of a terrorist slipping in through the vetting system. Not a perfect system There’s no question that there are challenges to screening refugees from conflict zones like Syria. Intelligence and national security officials have noted the paucity of data. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress in October 2015 that the intelligence in Syria is "not as rich as we would like it to be," while FBI Director James Comey said there are "gaps" in data availability. The use of fake documents and passports are also causes for concern, according to Jessica Vaughan of the "low immigration, pro-immigrant" Center for Immigration Studies. But, again, this is not the same thing as "no system to vet" at all. "No system is foolproof," said David Martin, a University of Virginia professor who’s previously held posts at DHS and the State Department. "If we really wanted a foolproof system, we would shut down immigration entirely." (This seems to be what Trump is advocating.) According to the State Department, Syrians tend to have more identity documents than other refugee groups around the world, and the reasons they give for missing documents — for example, a bomb dropping on their house — can be verified. And contrary to what Trump suggests, Clinton has spoken about stepping up the rigor of the vetting and proposed specific solutions. "Congress needs to provide enough resources to ensure we have sufficient personnel deployed to run the most thorough possible process," she said in a December 2015 statement. Finally, we should note that refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks of any traveler category to the United States. So it "makes no operational sense" for ISIS to take advantage of the refugee program, Anne Speckhard, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University, told us previously. "Given how easy it is to send a European extremist to the U.S. via Europe, why would an ISIS guy in Syria wait the three years it takes to get refugee status?" Speckhard said. Our ruling Trump said there is "no system to vet" refugees from the Middle East. While there are concerns about information gaps, a system does exist and has existed since 1980. It involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies as well as the United Nations. Refugee vetting typically takes one to two years and includes numerous rounds of security checks.

pomt-00304	Says Ohio congressional candidate Danny O’Connor has raised "90 percent of his campaign funds from liberal out of staters."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2018/sep/25/troy-balderson/does-danny-oconnor-get-90-percent-his-campaign-fun/	The Republican incumbent in Ohio’s 12th Congressional District is being outraised by his Democratic opponent by nearly $4 million. But Republican Troy Balderson says that’s because Democrat Danny O’Connor has received most of his campaign funds from out-of-state contributors. A Sept. 8, 2018, Cleveland Plain Dealer story points out that Balderson, of Zanesville, is badly losing the fundraising battle in his November rematch with O’Connor, a Franklin County recorder. The two faced off in an Aug. 7 special election that ended in Balderson narrowly beating O’Connor to hold the seat for the next two months. "Liberal, out-of-state special-interest groups are continuing to prop up Danny O’Connor’s campaign in their efforts to retake the House and put Nancy Pelosi in the Speaker’s chair," the Balderson campaign said in a statement published in newspapers in Cleveland and Columbus. "While O'Connor's campaign has raised 90 percent of his campaign funds from liberal out of staters, our campaign is funded by hard-working Ohioans who want someone who will fight for them and their middle class values." We wondered, do 90 percent of O’Connor’s campaign contributions come from outside of Ohio? No, but O’Connor is raising significant support from out-of-state donors. What makes claims like this difficult to prove, or disprove Trying to measure where a candidate’s campaign funds come from can be tricky for a couple of reasons. First, donations under $200 aren’t itemized, so campaigns aren’t required to provide the addresses of those low-dollar donors. Second, Democrats running for Congress have been using ActBlue PAC, which is based in Somerville, Mass., to manage online candidate contributions. Fundraising overall We went to the Center for Responsive Politics, an authoritative database of campaign finance data, to examine O’Connor’s numbers, as well as the Federal Election Commission. Both databases show that, as of late August, O’Connor has raised around $5.5 million with a little over $1 million in cash on hand. (Balderson has raised almost $1.8 million with just under $93,000 in cash on hand.) O’Connor has received $405,528 in individual contributions from more than 2,000 Ohio donors, according to FEC filings. This compares to roughly $1,356,583 raised by the campaign from all other states combined. That adds up to $1.76 million in donations, just about a third of everything O’Connor has raised. Where is the rest of the money? More than $3.5 million of O’Connor’s donations are unitemized. FEC press officer Judith Ingram told us that donations under $200 do not require the identifying information needed to know where each geographically comes from. Brendan Quinn, outreach manager at the Center for Responsive Politics, said the same. "Campaigns are only required to itemize contributions of $200 or more, and that includes multiple donations that add up to that amount," Quinn explained. "And according to our data, over 60 percent (64.87) of O’Connor’s contributions are those small individual contributions under $200." But of O’Connor’s itemized donations, 23 percent of the money received comes from Ohio and 77 percent comes from out of state. Summer fundraising: More out-of-state donations So why did Balderson claim 90 percent of O’Connor’s funds came from "liberal out of staters"? Balderson campaign manager Jenna Knepper said the campaign zeroed in on the period between July 19 and Aug. 2, the closing weeks of the special election. It counted the number of people who contributed from Ohio versus other states during that time period. FEC filings for that report show that O’Connor received a total of 12,580 contributions. Of those, 1,368 came from Ohio, and the other 11,212 came from other states. By those figures, 10.9 percent of the contributions originated from Ohio and the other 89.1 came from outside of the state. The O’Connor campaign’s response The O’Connor campaign says he has raised more money from Ohioans than the FEC data show. They backed that up with figures from their records from Jan. 1, 2018, to Aug. 27, 2018, which they reported to the NGP, a privately owned voter database and web hosting service provider used by the Democratic Party. These incorporate the contributions not included in national databases because of the lower donation amounts. The numbers show that O’Connor has raised around $866,233 in Ohio with an average donation of $37.54 — more than double what the FEC data show. Our ruling Balderson said O’Connor has raised "90 percent of his campaign funds from liberal out of staters." In the most recent fundraising report, almost 90 percent of O’Connor’s campaign contributions came from donors outside of Ohio. That’s donors, not money. But when it comes to O’Connors overall itemized donations thus far in the race, the situation isn’t as stark. Combined, 23 percent stemmed from in-state contributions, and 77 percent came from all other states combined. The percentages do not include contributions under $200, because the FEC doesn’t require certain information such as donors’ addresses. Balderson’s statement is inflated and incomplete.

pomt-09891	The stimulus "has delivered $43 billion in tax relief to American working families and businesses"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/22/barack-obama/obama-overstates-tax-relief-individuals-and-busine/	To counter Republican criticism that the stimulus package has made little impact on the economy, President Barack Obama has been boasting that the package has provided $43 billion in tax relief. But his claim includes a questionable tax number that inflates the impact. In his July 11, 2009, weekly radio address, Obama said the stimulus "has delivered $43 billion in tax relief to American working families and businesses. Without the help the Recovery Act has provided to struggling states, it's estimated that state deficits would be nearly twice as large as they are now, resulting in tens of thousands of additional layoffs." We wondered if he was right that the stimulus has provided $43 billion in tax relief. The $787 billion stimulus bill comes in two parts. About $499 billion was set aside to fund new roads, hire teachers and generally keep people employed, an issue we've explored previously. The other part of the bill — about $288 billion — is meant for tax breaks to individuals and businesses. According to the Congressional Budget Office, $64.8 billion in tax relief is expected to go out this year. The $43 billion Obama refers to would mean the government has doled out about two-thirds of this year's tax relief. We asked the Treasury Department for a breakdown of that $43 billion. Here's what a department spokeswoman told us has been provided to individuals and businesses: • About $15 billion has come from a new program called Making Work Pay, the tax cut for the middle class that Obama promised during the campaign. In 2009 and 2010, about 95 percent of working families will get between $400 and $800 per year back from the government through reduced paycheck withholdings. Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that $19 billion will be paid out this year, so the government is nearing its goal for 2009. • About $11 billion in tax relief has resulted in allowing businesses to write off 50 percent of new equipment purchases, like computers, construction equipment or cars used for work. That's a little less than the $23.5 billion the tax committee expects the government to spend this year. • About $5 billion has gone to help people who have lost their jobs pay for health insurance. • The Treasury Department estimates that extending the fixes to Alternative Minimum Tax has saved people about $8 billion, although the congressional tax committee puts that number at about $2 billion this year (we'll get into this discrepancy a bit later). That fix is necessary to prevent the AMT from drastically raising taxes on millions of Americas. Originally, the AMT was targeted at very wealthy people, but over the years it has grown to include those in lower income brackets as well. So Congress has been passing yearly fixes to keep middle class taxpayers from paying the AMT. • The remaining $4 billion is made up of a mix of other tax breaks. So the Treasury Department's breakdown of Obama's $43 billion claim makes sense to us — except for the inclusion of the AMT money. We're not sure why the Treasury estimate is $6 billion more than the tax committee's figure. And we found the Treasury Department was vague on how the number was calculated, saying it takes into account estimated taxes as well as wages and salaries. A spokesman would not give more detail to us on the record. Furthermore, many tax experts argue that including AMT relief in the stimulus tax calculation is a bit of smoke and mirrors. By extending the AMT fix every year, the government ensures that the 3 million to 4 million people paying the tax doesn't expand to more than 20 million people, said Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the free-market Cato Institute. "AMT is something those people never expect to pay," he said. "It's kind of like saying that, if I didn't rob you on the way home from work today, I gave you money." It's a trick that the Bush administration employed to inflate tax relief, and it seems the Obama administration is taking a similar approach, Mitchell said. Rosanne Altshuler, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a collaboration between the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, agreed. "On one hand, you have to view the baseline [for the estimate] as the current law," which includes the AMT patch, she said. "But it's not money back from the government in the sense that it's a refund or money being withheld. It would be different if people expected to pay for it." Altshuler's group gave the AMT extension a D-minus in its Tax Stimulus Report Card because "the provision would provide virtually no economic stimulus. Because the patch is perennially extended, it would have no effect on behavior in 2009. Almost 80 percent of the benefits would go to the richest 20 percent of households, who would be least likely to spend the additional funds and stimulate demand." Back to Obama's claim. He's right that quite a bit of tax relief has been given to individuals and businesses, but our experts tell us that counting AMT relief doesn't really make sense because people would not expect to pay that money in taxes in the first place. It's not tax relief as much as it is the status quo. On top of that, the administration's estimate for how much tax relief the AMT has provided is far more than the congressional estimate, creating some uncertainty about how much money the tax break is really worth in the first place. So we don't think Obama can accurately say $43 billion. It could be as low as $35 billion. He's making incorrect assumptions and including the impact of a tax change that isn't much of a tax break. That's a significant exaggeration that earns a Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-07-22T17:25:37	2009-07-11	['United_States']
pomt-14909	Says his tax plan wouldn't leave the federal government with a $1.1 trillion hole.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/04/ben-carson/does-ben-carsons-tithe-based-tax-plan-lead-1-trill/	Ben Carson’s tithe-based tax plan became the subject of a computational tussle between him and a CNBC moderator during the third GOP debate. Carson, a Seventh-day Adventist, has advocated for the federal government to adopt a tithing system across the board, referring to the Judeo-Christian practice of giving one-tenth of one’s income to the Church. "I think God is a pretty fair guy," he reasoned in the first Republican debate. Moderator Becky Quick pointed out that a 10 percent flat tax would bring in a lot less revenue and asked how would that work. Tithing was just an analogy and the rate would actually be closer to 15 percent, Carson responded, adding that he’d fill the gap through "strategic cutting." But Quick continued to press him on the numbers. Here’s a snippet of their exchange on Oct. 28: Quick: "You would have to cut government by about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole." Carson: "It's not true." Quick: "It is true. I looked at the numbers." Carson: "When we put all the facts down, you will be able to see that it's not true. It works out very well." So true or not true? Carson has yet to release a tax plan, and his spokesman Doug Watts said that Quick "got several assumptions wrong" though he didn’t respond when we asked him which ones. But based on what Carson has said so far, Quick’s math is sound. The plan Carson’s campaign website calls for wholesale tax reform and "to end the IRS as we know it," but includes almost no specifics. That makes the Quick and Carson argument "really quite pointless" since there aren’t enough details to properly model, said Scott Hodge of the Tax Foundation, an organization that analyzes tax plans and tends to take a free-market, low-tax approach. "When Dr. Carson releases enough detail of his plan we will model it as well on an apples-to-apples basis as the other plans," Hodge said. Carson’s formal tax plan will be released sometime within the next 30 days, Watts told us. Until then, we’ll assess what he has proposed so far, according to analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation, as well as our own research. It includes: • A flat income tax rate of 10 to 15 percent, phased in over time, with no deductions or loopholes; • A six-month tax hiatus for corporate profits overseas, but 10 percent has to be used in enterprise zones; • A corporate tax rate of 15 to 20 percent; • Eliminate the payroll tax, estate tax and the Affordable Care Act. Quick’s math Under the current tax system, the United States is expected to collect $3.2 trillion in revenue in 2015, while government spending will reach $3.7 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Quick likely got her numbers by applying Carson’s 15 percent tax rate to the total personal income and the total corporate income ($15.4 trillion and $2.1 trillion respectively, by the latest Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates for 2015). That would generate about $2.6 trillion in revenue. So Carson’s plan falls $0.6 trillion short of anticipated revenue, and $1.1 trillion short of spending. To break even, you’d have to reduce spending by about 30 percent annually, not as Quick said, 40 percent. We should note that this line of computation assumes that Carson would get rid of all other sources of revenue. Though he hasn’t offered specifics on excise taxes, customs duties, etc., he has proposed to eliminate both the payroll tax (projected to generate $1.1 trillion in 2015) and the estate tax ($20 billion), which alone put him in the hole. Carson’s math After objecting to Quick’s calculations, Carson himself crunched the numbers a different way during the CNBC debate: "If you talk about an $18 trillion economy, you are talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product, you are talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion. But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that's not, by any stretch, pie in the sky." Experts, however, had a few bones to pick with Carson’s math, starting with its premise. First, not all of GDP is taxable, pointed out Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center. To apply his rate to all $18 trillion, Carson would have to tax health insurance premiums, pensions and government spending (the $3.7 trillion that Carson wants to cut) to name a few. Second, even if we assume that you can tax all of GDP, the 15 percent tax rate still falls short of anticipated revenue and spending, as Carson acknowledges himself. Contrary to what he said, however, you can’t "make that amount up" by applying the rate to corporate taxes and capital gains. That would be double-counting, since those are already a part of the total GDP figure, a post-debate CNBC article pointed out. In short, taxing all of GDP by 15 percent would still create a $1 trillion hole this year. "(That’s) the biggest piece of the biggest pie that we can come up with, and you’d still be short 20 percent of revenue. Good luck with that," Williams said. Our ruling Carson said "it’s not true" that his plan would leave us with a $1.1 trillion hole, as moderator Becky Quick said. But Quick’s math is sound, based on what's publicly known about Carson's plan. Carson’s 15 percent flat tax would generate a $1.1 trillion hole. By his own math, his plan would create a $1 trillion hole. We rate Carson’s claim False.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-11-04T13:22:44	2015-10-28	['None']
pomt-03932	Says Travis County's unemployment rate is below the national average while its poverty rate exceeds the national average--and local poverty is rising.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/21/sarah-eckhardt/sarah-eckhardt-says-unemployment-travis-county-low/	CORRECTION, 2:58 p.m., Feb. 25, 2013: This article has been amended to note statistical weaknesses in comparing estimated Travis County poverty rates of 2011 and 2010. The additional information incorporates comments from Eva DeLuna Castro of the Center for Public Policy Priorities and a related statement by a U.S. Census Bureau expert. Our rating of the claim did not change. A Travis County commissioner who may bid in 2014 to succeed Sam Biscoe as county judge suggests conditions are tough locally despite "present prosperity." In a Feb. 18, 2013, email blast, Sarah Eckhardt called for reversing "our rising poverty," after writing: "Our unemployment rate is below the national average, yet our poverty rate exceeds the national average." That’s a three-part claim: Is unemployment below the rest of the nation? Does the county’s poverty rate exceed the national rate--and is local poverty rising? Unemployment Eckhardt, a Democrat, told us by email that Travis County’s December 2012 unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, meaning that was the share of adults who did not have a job, had actively looked for work in the prior four weeks and were available for work. That was less than the Texas rate of 6.1 percent, Eckhardt said, and the U.S. rate of 7.8 percent. Those state and national rates, she cautioned, were adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations such as changes in weather, harvests, major holidays and school schedules. The county’s rate was not adjusted, Eckhardt noted. By email, a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist advised against comparing seasonally adjusted and unadjusted unemployment rates. Cheryl Abbot also said that the unadjusted December 2012 national unemployment rate was 7.6 percent when the Travis County rate was 4.9 percent. At our request, Abbot provided a chart showing Travis County’s unemployment rate and the national rate from 2009 through 2012. The county unadjusted unemployment rate consistently was less than the national rate, the chart shows. The county experienced its highest rate, 7.3 percent, in January 2010, the same month the national rate topped out at 10.6 percent. So, the county’s jobless rate has been lower than the national one. Poverty In 2011, Eckhardt said, Travis County and Texas had identical 18 percent poverty rates, according to the 2011 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, while the national poverty rate was 16 percent. As noted in a Dec. 16, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, poverty rates can vary by subgroups. That story says that according to 2011 bureau surveys, 23 percent of Travis County’s school-age children lived in poverty. The story says the 2011 child poverty rate ranged in neighboring counties from 10 percent in Williamson County to 21 percent in Bastrop County. Nationally, 21 percent of children lived in poverty that year, the story says. Eckhardt provided a chart, which she described as coming from a county presentation drawing on the bureau’s surveys, indicating the county’s poverty rate was as low as 12.5 percent in 2000, but escalated to 15.7 percent in 2005 before dipping to 14.7 percent in 2007 and then increasing for three years to 19.2 percent in 2010. We did not find that report. But the county’s December 2012 "Travis County Snapshot" report, drawing on the census surveys, says 192,436 county residents lived in poverty in 2011, down from 194,156 residents in poverty in 2010, but more than the 163,690 impoverished residents in 2009. Next, with help from bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein, we confirmed that the county had a greater share of low-income residents than the nation in 2011 when the federal poverty level for a family of four was about $23,000. For a longer view, we checked annual poverty rates for the county, Texas and the nation from 2000 through 2011 based on the bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, which combine data from administrative records, results from the once-a-decade census and more recent population estimates and the bureau’s household surveys to "provide consistent and reliable single-year estimates," the agency says. Estimated Poverty Rates (Percentage of Population) YEAR TRAVIS COUNTY TEXAS U.S. 2000 9.9 % 14.6 % 11.3 % 2001 10.6 15 11.7 2002 11.9 15.4 12.1 2003 13.9 16.2 12.5 2004 14.3 16.2 12.6 2005 15.5 13.5 13.3 2006 15.1 16.9 13.3 2007 14.6 16.3 13 2008 14.4 15.8 13.2 2009 16 17.1 14.3 2010 18.8 17.9 15.3 2011 18.1 18.5 15.9 Source: Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Feb. 20, 2013) The county’s poverty rate was around the same as or less than the national rate from 2000 through 2002, but the county rate exceeded the national rate starting in 2003 when the county rate was 13.9 percent and the national rate was 12.5 percent, according to the estimates. The county’s rate went up and down over the 11 years, escalating from 9.9 percent in 2000 to 15.5 percent in 2005, then dropping three straight years to 14.4 percent in 2009 before increasing to 18.8 percent in 2010--before dipping to 18.1 percent in 2011, when the national rate was 15.9 percent. So, the county poverty rate exceeds the national rate, though the county rate decreased from 2010 to 2011, the year of the latest available rate. After we posted this fact check, a Texas expert objected, saying that the county’s estimated 2010 and 2011 poverty rates were too close for anyone to conclude poverty went down between years. Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst with the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, also said the drop in the raw estimated number of residents in poverty--as shown in the county’s snapshot report on the 2011 American Community Survey--was likewise too slight to be statistically certain. By our eyes, the margins of error in the 2011 and 2009-11 survey results mean that about 179,000 to 206,000 residents were in poverty in 2011, compared with 176,000 to 188,000 residents in 2009-11. Phew. Castro said that "when surveys require several years’ worth of data in order to be statistically significant, you can’t isolate year-to-year trends – they all get smoothed out in the averages. That’s why looking at long-term trends, like over a decade, are more helpful. They tell you what’s changing (or not changing) in the underlying nature of an area’s economy that really improves or worsens residents’ quality of life." Separately, we ran Castro’s point about comparing the county’s estimated 2010 and 2011 poverty rates past the Census Bureau. Wes Basel, chief of its Small Area Estimates Branch, agreed by email that the 2011-2010 difference in the county’s estimated poverty rate is "not large enough to be statistically significant," though he said comparisons of the county’s 2011 estimated rate to estimates for 2005 through 2010 are statistically significant; those estimated rates mostly went up in the intervening years, though there were dips, too. Eckhardt, standing by her claim, earlier noted the near doubling in the county’s poverty rate since 2000. "The year-to-year snapshot is not nearly as interesting as the" longer timeframe, she said. Our ruling Eckhardt said the county’s unemployment rate is below the national average, yet its poverty rate exceeds the national average--and local poverty is rising. The local jobless rate has consistently trailed the national rate and the county’s poverty rate has exceeded the national rate since 2003. The county’s poverty rate dipped from 2010 to 2011, though that dip was not statistically significant. Also, the 2011 rate of 18.1 percent was nearly double the rate in 2000, so it looks like poverty has risen over the years. Then again, Eckhardt's statement does not acknowledge that the county rate has oscillated year to year, sometimes going down. It's not been a steady rise. We rate her claim as Mostly True.

pomt-00485	Says Matt Rosendale "consistently supported land use rules that would help developers like him and hurt farmers in Montana."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/09/jon-tester/montana-senate-race-long-standing-battle-between-d/	In Montana’s contentious U.S. Senate race, Democratic incumbent Jon Tester accused his Republican challenger of placing the interests of property developers over Montana farmers. Tester is making the case that opponent Matt Rosendale’s previous career as a land developer colored his voting decisions as a state lawmaker. "Matt Rosendale consistently supported land use rules that would help developers like him and hurt farmers in Montana," Tester said on his website. While the legislative debate over Montana land use laws may not have grabbed national headlines, communities across America are familiar with the push-and-pull between developers and farmers, as well as local government’s attempts to balance these often adversarial competing interests. We decided to take a closer look at Montana’s case. Big Sky Country soil Montana — nicknamed "Big Sky Country" — holds farmland so dear that its soil gets a nod in the state constitution in a provision directing lawmakers to "protect, enhance, and develop all of agriculture." So what happens if you want to take a piece of Montana property and divide it into smaller lots for individual sale? Under longstanding Montana law, local governments generally have a legal duty to weigh the agricultural impact of such subdivisions. Basically, if planners determine the move would have a "potentially significant adverse impact" on agriculture, they can force the developer to take "reasonable steps" to minimize the impact, according to a report from the University of Montana School of Law. Not surprisingly, developers have faced political headwinds from some agricultural and environmental groups when they’ve sought to change the rules. Tester’s campaign pointed us to votes on two such measures that Rosendale, who is now the state’s auditor, cast in his previous role as a Montana lawmaker. Both bills were vetoed by the state’s Democratic governor. But had they passed, they would have substantially altered Montana’s land use law. One bill — the more sweeping of the two measures we looked at — was a 2011 proposal to reduce the influence local governments have on whether a proposed subdivision can move forward. Specifically, the bill — HB 542 — would have narrowed the range of factors planners could consider while assessing a subdivision’s agricultural impact. The proposal would also have imposed a requirement that planners back up their arguments with peer-reviewed studies, and it set a strict deadline on the amount of time the government had to deliver its findings. And under the bill, if a court ruled in a developer’s favor, the losing party would have to pay attorney’s fees — a provision that experts said was meant to discourage legal challenges to subdivision proposals and environmental permitting decisions. Rosendale voted in favor of both the House bill in 2011, as well as a similar Senate bill in 2013. His campaign did not dispute Tester’s characterization of the bills as pro-developer. In fact, every source we consulted unanimously agreed with that conclusion. "This bill was an attempt by developers to make it easier to subdivide suburban property for housing development," Mike Dennison, chief political reporter for Montana Television Network who covered the HB 542 debate in 2011, told us. Because the pro-developer portion of the claim is not disputed, we’re concerned here with only one question: Did the measures that Rosendale supported stand to hurt Montana farmers? The answer is a mixed picture. Some farmers hurt Opponents’ main argument against changing the law was that it would lead to the disappearance of Montana farmland. As evidence, Tester’s campaign pointed us to a 2011 op-ed in The Missoulian that carried the headline, "Subdivision bill bad for farmers, ranchers." In it, Stephanie Laporte, a member of the Community Food and Agriculture Coalition, argued the proposed changes would gut the law’s original intent of protecting Montana farmland, by "allow(ing) subdivisions to run wild through farming and ranching communities." "Make no mistake," Laporte wrote, "if approved by the Senate, HB 542 will hurt farmers and ranchers, lead to the permanent loss of agricultural land, and jeopardize Montana's top industry for decades to come." Dennison, who covered the legislative debate for the Billings Gazette, said some farmers may have viewed the prospect of rolling back agricultural protections as a kind of slippery slope. "It’s possible that farmers who don’t want to subdivide their land may feel squeezed by other landowners doing it and feel powerless to stop encroaching development," Dennison told us. "They may have seen this bill as making it harder (for local government) to slow things." Despite these concerns, the House bill (and a similar 2013 Senate bill) cleared both legislative chambers before dying on the desk of a Democratic governor. "I issue this veto because the amendments to Montana’s subdivision review process contained in HB 542 are unnecessary, contrary to the public interest, and could jeopardize one of Montana’s most important industries – farming and ranching," Gov. Brian Schweitzer said in an April 2011 veto message. Other farmers helped On the other hand, some farmers welcomed the bill. To its supporters, the changes represented a regulatory rollback that would broaden farmers’ rights to do as they wish with their private property. "Farming and agricultural interests in Montana, on land-use policy, tend to default toward less regulation," Dennison told us. "They see regulation and planning as possible encroachment on private-property rights, which they are very enthusiastic about." Rather than a government planner blocking the subdivision of farmland, property owners always have another option, Dennison noted: "If farmers don’t want development, they don’t have to subdivide their land." Based on an analysis the voting breakdown of the 2011 House bill, Dennison reasoned that while some farm interests opposed the bill, most of the mainstream agricultural groups likely either supported or didn’t oppose it because of the property-rights issue. Chuck Johnson, a veteran Montana political and state government reporter for the Last Best News and Missoula Current, also said the bill presented a mixed picture in terms of its effect on Montana farmers. "It would have hurt some farmers," he told us. "But it would have benefited those farmers — probably in the small minority — who wanted to subdivide their land or sell it to someone who wanted to subdivide." A spokesman for Rosendale cited the case of a Montanan named George Lake who saw the measure as a way to broaden his property rights. In testimony before his local government committee, Lake said he spent three years appealing to local planners to approve the subdivision of his relatively modest plot, before ultimately giving up. "The unpredictable and inconsistent approval process is a huge issue for small-time property owners like (Lake) who don’t have the clout that a major developer does," said Shane Scanlon, communications director for Matt Rosendale. Farming groups divided Farm groups were divided on the subdivision law changes Rosendale backed, which would seem to underscore the farming community’s mixed feelings. The Montana Farmers Union, which tends to align with Democrats and has traditionally represented relatively smaller farmers, opposed the 2013 Senate measure, calling it "an anti-agriculture bill." (The Montana Farmers Union did not respond to a request for comment.) But the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, which typically lines up with Republican positions and tends to support relatively larger farmers, backed the measure. "It was helpful to developers but not particularly harmful to agriculture," John Youngberg, executive vice president of the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, told us. Johnson, the veteran Montana politics reporter who explained the farm groups’ political leanings to us, said that despite the groups’ partisan tendencies, they don’t always line up on opposite sides of the aisle. "At times, the various farming and ranching groups work together on issues, and are quite formidable," he said. "This issue was one where they disagreed." Our ruling Tester said, "Matt Rosendale consistently supported land use rules that would help developers like him and hurt farmers in Montana." For this fact-check, we looked at two measures that would have relaxed Montana’s land use rules. Sources we consulted unanimously characterized these bills as pro-developer. The question of how farmers would fare under the proposed changes, however, yielded a much more mixed answer. Some farmers appeared fearful that laxer regulation would lead to the disappearance of Montana farmland. Yet others welcomed the broader private-property rights engendered in the new laws. Farm groups were divided on the subdivision law changes Rosendale backed, which underscores the farming community’s mixed feelings. We rate this Half True.

pomt-09797	The House of Representatives has never passed a resolution of disapproval to condemn a member's behavior.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/16/john-boehner/boehner-claims-his-chamber-has-never-passed-resolu/	Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina has received a proverbial slap on the wrist for yelling "You lie!" during President Barack Obama's recent address to Congress. The scuffle officially ended Sept. 15, 2009, when the House of Representatives passed 240-179 a resolution disapproving of Wilson's behavior during the speech six days earlier. But before the vote, Republican Leader John Boehner gave the majority a piece of his mind. "We all know Joe Wilson. He is a decent man. And to put him through this on the floor of the House I think is unacceptable, and it is a partisan stunt," Boehner said on the House floor. "There has been behavior that has gone on around here far more serious than this, and it didn't bring a resolution to the floor to condemn someone's behavior. Yes people have made mistakes. Some have come down to the floor and apologized, others have not. But none of it -- none of it -- required a resolution. ... Never has this happened before." Passing the resolution would set a bad precedent, Boehner said. Given all the mischief lawmakers have gotten themselves into in the past, we wondered whether Boehner was right, that the House had never passed a resolution of disapproval to condemn a member's behavior. Some background: During his Sept. 9 speech, Obama said, "There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false — the reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally." Wilson yelled from the crowd, "You lie!" We put Wilson's outburst to the Truth-O-Meter, which you can read about here . According to the Constitution, Congress has a right to punish its own members for such misconduct. Article 1, Section 5, Clause 2 of the Constitution states that, "Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.” And it turns out such reprimands can come in multiple forms, according to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives. An expulsion, for example, requires a two-thirds majority vote in the House. The maneuver was most recently used on July 24, 2002, to rid the chamber of former Rep. James Traficant, a Democrat from Ohio who went to jail for trading political favors for cash and gifts. He was released from prison on Sept. 2, 2009. Other examples include censures and reprimands, which only require a majority for passage and simply express a formal disapproval of the conduct. A resolution of disapproval -- Wilson's punishment -- is more often used as a way for the House to condemn a foreign or executive branch action. It is a sentiment and carries no force of law. However, it is rarely used as an internal disciplinary tool, said Anthony Wallis, research analyst for the historian's office, who described the action as the least severe of the many forms of congressional punishment. While there may be more such instances deep in congressional history - finding them would require reviewing reams of legislation introduced since the founding of Congress - the only example the historian's office could readily find was against Rep. Bill Thomas, who, in 2003 as the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called in the U.S. Capitol Police to remove Democratic panel members who were protesting Thomas' handling of a pension bill. The resolution was dropped by a vote of 170-143. So, back to Boehner's claim. In recent history, there's only been one instance of the chamber specifically using a resolution of disapproval to punish a lawmaker, though the historian's office said there may be more. Given that small bit of uncertainty, we give Boehner a Mostly True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2009-09-16T11:19:12	2009-09-15	['None']
pomt-06547	Says the federal government hosted a conference and "ordered 250 muffins at 16 bucks a piece."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/04/bill-oreilly/16-muffin-included-coffee-tea-event-space/	The $16 muffin: It’s just another piece of evidence that federal spending is out of control, according to pundit Bill O’Reilly and others who have pounced on an inspector general's report as evidence of a wasteful Washington. O’Reilly left his usual perch hosting The O’Reilly Factor on Fox News to visit Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show. The announced topic was O’Reilly’s new book about Abraham Lincoln. But the segment quickly became two powerful pundits from opposite sides of the political spectrum debating the role of government in society. That, and trying to crack each other up. "The $16 dollar muffin -- do we all know what the $16 muffin is?" O’Reilly said, looking around. Stewart hadn’t heard, which seemed to delight O’Reilly, while the audience guffawed. "Look, $16 muffin," O’Reilly explained. "Broke the story last week on ‘The Factor.’ You were otherwise occupied, making your little wise remarks, not reading what’s happening. They had a bunch of conferences for pin heads, the federal government’s, and they ordered 250 muffins at 16 bucks a piece." "That’s a lot for muffins," Stewart said, playing the straight guy. "Yeah!" said O’Reilly. The trouble with O’Reilly’s anecdote is that it’s not entirely accurate. The $16 muffin started with a 122-page report released Sept. 20, 2011, from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General. The report followed a 2007 audit that found few internal controls on conference spending, especially for food and beverages. New guidelines were issued, and this year’s report was a check-up to see how the department was doing. Not so great, according to the recent report. "All the conferences occurred at major hotels that applied service fees – usually around 20 percent – to the cost of already expensive menu items. Our assessment of food and beverage charges revealed that some DOJ components did not minimize conference costs as required by federal and DOJ guidelines. For example, one conference served $16 muffins, while another served Beef Wellington hors d’oeuvres that cost $7.32 per serving," the report said. "In our opinion, the lack of documentation we found regarding the necessity of costly food and beverage items indicated that not all sponsors were seriously questioning the need for expensive meals and refreshments at their events," it added. Media reports summarized the inspector general’s overall negative findings, but couldn’t resist starting with the $16 muffin. In fairness, it was a verbatim quote from the report. However, reading deeper into the report revealed that the $16 muffins were not completely a la carte. The department received some complimentary beverages and some fruit, though whether additional items were served at breakfast or at a later break is not quite clear. Justice Department officials also told the inspector general that they were provided the meeting space without charge, though the report notes it’s departmental policy to use federal government meeting spaces whenever possible. And, the inspector general found that conference planners didn’t do any kind of cost breakdowns to show that the government got a better deal overall when it purchased food and received free meeting space. The conference was held at the Capital Hilton Hotel in Washington in August 2007, and after the $16 muffin made headlines, the hotel’s headquarters issued a statement saying that invoices sometimes don’t fully reflect the services provided. "Hilton has a long standing practice of working with government agencies to plan meetings and events that fall within their budgets," said the statement from Hilton Worldwide Corporate Headquarters. "Dining receipts are often abbreviated and do not reflect the full pre-contracted menu and service provided, as is the case with recent media reports of breakfast items approved for some government meetings. In Washington, the contracted breakfast included fresh fruit, coffee, juice, and muffins, plus tax and gratuity, for an inclusive price of $16 per person." The Washington Post reported that if a person off the street went into the Capital Hilton Hotel and ordered pastries, coffee and a fruit plate, it would cost $29.15. That includes tax but no tip. The inspector general’s office responded to Hilton’s statement with its own statement: "The $16 muffin was based on documentation obtained during the audit showing that the Department was invoiced by the Capital Hilton Hotel $4,200 including gratuity and service charge for 250 muffins. Although we made repeated attempts over several months to reach the Capital Hilton during the course of the audit to discuss its billing, it was not responsive to our numerous requests. Since our report was issued, the Capital Hilton has stated that other food and beverage items, such as coffee, tea, and fruit, were included in the charged amount, but did not provide any supporting documentation. Even if the $4,200 fee included additional food and beverage items, the OIG believes, as stated in our report, that many individual food and beverage items listed on conference invoices and paid by the Department were very costly." Our ruling O’Reilly got the $16 muffin story from a lengthy and thorough report issued by an independent inspector general. Additionally, the "$16 muffin" is how the inspector general phrased its charge of excessive spending. We reviewed the long report, and it seems to be thorough and independent, as are most reports from inspectors general. The report’s main findings are that the government is paying for items that appear too costly when invoices are reviewed. Even if the $16 muffin is fiction, then it seems reasonable to believe that the Justice Department’s own spending records are incomplete or inaccurate. On the other hand, a full reading of the report showed the $16 muffins included beverages and possibly fruit, as well as meeting space. While a $16 breakfast is no bargain, it’s not as bad as $16 for a solitary baked good. Also, O’Reilly made his remarks to Jon Stewart on Sept. 28, after Hilton issued its first statement on Sept. 23 saying the invoices may not have been complete. So the report was under question when O’Reilly debated Stewart. (We contacted O’Reilly for comment, but we didn’t hear back.) Because the federal government didn't pay $16 for a muffin even if it paid too much for breakfast, we rate O’Reilly’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-02870	"During my eight years as county executive, we cut the number of county workers by 20 percent."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/14/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-cut-staffing-20-percent-d/	In his new book, Gov. Scott Walker says Milwaukee County made him do it. His Act 10 collective bargaining limits for state and local employees, that is. Walker writes in "Unintimidated" that his "searing" experience with labor unions while serving as Milwaukee County executive was the "ultimate source of the reforms I enacted as governor." "During my eight years as county executive, we cut the number of county workers by 20 percent, and turned a $3.5 million county deficit into a surplus," he wrote. He added: "On one hand that is an achievement because the county government needed to be smaller. But because of collective bargaining we couldn’t do it in the best way. Being forced to get rid of productive workers while retaining slackers, and having my hands tied by union intransigence and collective bargaining rules, was a searing experience." Walker tried with mixed success to privatize and outsource certain county services, in part to save the county on employee benefits costs that ballooned after years of pension padding schemes. Did his county administration downsize the county’s staffing ranks by 20% in eight years? The number checks out, we found. Annual county budget books document the number of full-time equivalent employees in Milwaukee County’s operating departments. The count dropped in every budget approved in Walker’s era, which covered nine budgets from 2003 to 2011. The year before he took office after a 2002 special election, the workforce stood at 7,047. His first year it was 6,703, and when he left it was 5,336. That’s a drop of 1,367, or 20.4%, by our math. Every category of county operations saw a decrease. County parks, general administration, transportation and public works saw the deepest losses of staff on the county payroll, county records show. Private contractors were hired, in some cases, to do the work of county employees. Two final notes. Downsizing is nothing new at the county. The county workforce fell 22 percent in the nine budgets prior to Walker’s arrival, slightly outstripping his trimming efforts. The biggest factor was the 1995 sale of the county-owned Doyne Hospital. During Walker’s last term, the state of Wisconsin stripped Milwaukee County of its role in administering food aid, child care and medical assistance programs, citing county mismanagement. Walker had proposed something similar, saying the state could do it less expensively. That reduced the county workforce by more than 300. But because the workers didn’t become state employees until 2011, the reduction does not affect the employee tally during Walker’s county time, which ended in December 2010. Our rating First-time author Scott Walker wrote that, "during my eight years as county executive, we cut the number of county workers by 20 percent." The governor’s memory is correct. True.

pomt-10865	"Bill Richardson passed the first law in the nation giving National Guard soldiers $400,000 in life insurance."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/30/bill-richardson/first-but-with-caveats/	Richardson's ad says that, as governor of New Mexico in 2005, he "passed the first law in the nation giving National Guard soldiers $400,000 in life insurance." He sets up the claim, saying: "When a National Guard soldier would fall in combat, the family was only getting $12,000 — a national disgrace." He says 18 states followed his lead. We find the claims to be mostly true, though the nitpicker in us needs to point out that no governor can "pass" a law without a big assist from the legislative branch. Also, the ad overstates a couple of points. Let's focus on the set-up claim first. At the time in question — early 2005 — the families of fallen service personnel received a $12,420 "death gratuity" or benefit. What the ad does not say is that they probably also received the benefit of a low-cost, government-subsidized life insurance policy covering the soldiers for up to $250,000. About 95 percent of ready reserves purchase this insurance. In fact, it's automatically deducted from their pay unless they opt out. This overstatement aside, Richardson did initiate and push through legislation to pay the premiums on those policies for members of the New Mexico National Guard. The legislation does amount to "giving" soldiers life insurance, as the ad states. After Congress upped the maximum payout to $400,000, New Mexico agreed to cover the additional premiums for that coverage. The $12,420 death benefit, which many others described as disgraceful, was increased to $100,000 by Congress at the same time. Later in 2005 and 2006, the 18 states mentioned in the ad did pass some form of legislation improving benefits for military personnel. Were they all following Richardson's lead as the ad suggests? Richardson said in a February 2005 news release that 21 states had contacted his office about the insurance program. "Many are preparing legislation based on the New Mexico model," he said. Still, he is far from being a lone voice on the issue. Only a few months earlier, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., was proposing a generous bump in military death benefits during his 2004 presidential run. By mid January 2005, President Bush and many members of Congress from both parties were clamoring to increase death benefits for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. We note that Richardson first proposed paying for the premiums to his state's National Guard troops on Jan. 4, 2005. So he does appear to have been on the leading edge of the effort.

pomt-05923	In July 1996, Mitt Romney helped locate the missing teenage daughter of a partner at Bain Capital.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/30/chain-email/viral-internet-story-says-mitt-romney-helped-locat/	A number of readers recently have asked us to fact-check a story about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. The story, currently circulating on email, Facebook, and blogs, says that Romney helped a colleague of his at Bain Capital locate his missing teenage daughter. "In July 1996, the 14-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, a partner at Bain Capital, had disappeared," the story reads. "She had attended a rave party in New York City and gotten high on ecstasy. Three days later, her distraught father had no idea where she was. Romney took immediate action. He closed down the entire firm and asked all 30 partners and employees to fly to New York to help find Gay’s daughter. Romney set up a command center at the LaGuardia Marriott and hired a private detective firm to assist with the search. He established a toll-free number for tips, coordinating the effort with the NYPD, and went through his Rolodex and called everyone Bain did business with in New York and asked them to help find his friend’s missing daughter. Romney’s accountants at Price Waterhouse Cooper put up posters on street poles, while cashiers at a pharmacy owned by Bain put fliers in the bag of every shopper. Romney and the other Bain employees scoured every part of New York and talked with everyone they could – prostitutes, drug addicts – anyone. "That day, their hunt made the evening news, which featured photos of the girl and the Bain employees searching for her. As a result, a teenage boy phoned in, asked if there was a reward, and then hung up abruptly. The NYPD traced the call to a home in New Jersey, where they found the girl in the basement, shivering and experiencing withdrawal symptoms from a massive ecstasy dose. Doctors later said the girl might not have survived another day. Romney’s former partner credits Mitt Romney with saving his daughter’s life, saying, ‘It was the most amazing thing, and I’ll never forget this to the day I die.’ "So, here’s my epiphany: Mitt Romney simply can’t help himself. He sees a problem, and his mind immediately sets to work solving it, sometimes consciously, and sometimes not-so-consciously. He doesn’t do it for self-aggrandizement or for personal gain. He does it because that’s just how he’s wired." We can’t speak to what this episode says about Romney’s deeper character, but we can verify the facts of the episode. In fact, we did so when this story came up during the 2008 presidential election season. Back then, the story was circulating because of television ad created by Romney’s campaign. It featured Gay crediting Romney with helping reunite him with his daughter. As we reported then, based on contemporary news reports, the girl sneaked away on July 6, 1996, to go to a rave party in New York City, where she took the drug Ecstasy. She had told her parents she was playing tennis. When she didn't return, Boston-based Bain Capital, where Romney was founder and CEO, essentially shut down to help search for Gay's 14-year-old daughter Melissa. Bain Capital's 50 employees went to New York, where they convinced more than 200 other people to help search the streets for two days. They printed and passed out fliers. Romney clearly had a leading role in the company's operations, but news reports from the time also said other Bain partners helped coordinate the search effort. According to news reports, the teen was found in suburban New Jersey. A teen-aged boy, who took her in after her partying, called authorities late on July 11. Lt. David Peterson of the Montville Township Police told PolitiFact four years ago that police reports do not mention Romney personally. But Peterson, as well as reports at the time, agreed that the Bain Capital search generated important attention to the case of the missing girl. "The thing was it was a 911 caller that saw her on Channel 7 and called in," said Peterson, who recalled waiting for the girl to be picked up from Montville police station. Gay says Romney helped "save" his daughter, though previous reports have differed on the condition she was in. The line in the retelling now circulating -- that doctors told Gay she might not have lived another day -- comes from a Boston Globe report in 2002. Newsday, for its part, reported in July 1996 that "Melissa's parents said she was physically unharmed though she appeared 'very fragile.' The family's doctor had examined the girl and pronounced her in fairly good condition. ..." "She was not harmed," Robert Gay said at news conference after she was found, according to the New York Daily News. "She was in tears. We just gave her hugs and brought her back home." By all accounts, the effort by Bain employees was central to the effort to locate the girl, and Romney reportedly played a significant role in that effort. We give the account now circulating a rating of True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2012-01-30T17:25:53	2012-01-30	['Bain_Capital', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-07031	"Voted the ‘best specialty plate in America’"	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jul/03/friends-plum-beach-lighthouse/rhode-island-lighthouse-group-says-its-fundraising/	Specialty license plates are all the rage. In some states, you can choose from as many as 200 kinds. Rhode Island is no exception. You can pick from five specialty plates, with more on the way, not counting traditional ones for firefighters and the military. They’ve become so prominent that one -- promoting Plum Beach Lighthouse -- appears on a billboard on a stretch of Route 95 traveled by 100,000 motorists a day. "Voted the ‘best specialty plate in American,’ " the billboard reads. Now that’s license to brag! But is it true? We looked to our own navigational beacon, the Truth-O-Meter, to guide us. Our voyage first took us to the billboard near the Providence-Pawtucket line, best visible to southbound motorists. It shows the license plate, with its idyllic image of the Plum Beach Lighthouse surrounded by placid blue waters and two sport fishermen in a boat. "Get yours now!" reads the billboard, directing people to a Web site. "Thousands sold!" The license plate is a fundraising tool for Friends of Plum Beach Lighthouse, which acquired the 1897 lighthouse 22 years ago with the goal of preserving it. The spark-plug style lighthouse, off North Kingstown in Narragansett Bay’s West Passage, was abandoned following construction of the Jamestown Bridge in 1941. Seeking to raise funds to paint the lighthouse, the organization got General Assembly approval in late 2009 for a license plate commemorating the landmark. Since then, the group has sold nearly 4,300 plates, the most of any specialty plate in Rhode Island, president David Zapatka told us. Specialty plates cost $41.50, with $20 going toward the sponsoring group. So far, $86,000 has been raised for the lighthouse, some of which was used to paint the landmark and install solar-powered lighting, Zapatka said. Following the debut of the lighthouse tag, a local license plate lover nominated it for a competition held by the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association (ALPCA). Every year, its 3,000 members nominate license plates -- only new ones, by the way -- and then vote on the best. ALPCA announced that its members selected from 12 finalists from 2010. Half were so-called "general issue" plates, the kind that states redesign every few years and which most motorists get when they register their vehicles. The other half were specialty plates. New Mexico’s bright turquoise and gold plate took first. Plum Beach Lighthouse got second. While it was honored as the runner-up, it received no accolades for "best" anything. So we asked Zapatka to shine some light on the billboard’s claim. "I figured we might get called on that," he said immediately. "Rather than put up on the billboard, ‘We are the second best plate in America,’ we changed the wording to say we are the ‘best specialty plate in America.’ Did they officially come out and say, ‘You are the best specialty in America’? No." But, he insisted, Plum Beach Lighthouse beat out the other five specialty plates, not to mention all but one of the other plates. "Is it a stretch? Yes," he acknowledged. But, he said, "there is no other specialty plate that finished higher than us in the competition. … It’s a marketing scheme." What does ALPCA think about how the Rhode Island group is tooting its horn? Contest coordinator Gus Oliver, who didn’t vote since he was running the contest, called it a "misnomer" and said Friends of Plum Beach Lighthouse "may be stretching" the contest results in making its claim. A few years ago, there was a separate category for specialty plates, he said, but not anymore. "The most accurate statement is that, of the specialty plates, it scored the highest or the best," said Oliver, who’s from Tulsa, Okla. But Oliver didn’t take issue with the billboard. "They put a positive spin on it," he said, adding, "if there had been separate voting [for the two kinds of plates], I feel certain it would have represented the outcome." Zapatka, who works in media and is quite familiar with PolitiFact, asked, "Are you going to light our pants on fire?" Hmmm, we can see it now: a Plum Beach Lighthouse plate that reads PANTS-AFIRE. Nah. You just can’t go around tossing matches at non profit groups that are trying to raise money for causes as cherished as lighthouses. Besides, the license plate got more votes than any other specialty tag. Still, the lighthouse group knew it was making a claim that wasn’t quite accurate. That’s why we’re stamping their plate BRLY-TRU. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-00435	Says "black Americans have 10 times less wealth than white Americans."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/23/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-us-blacks-have-10-times-less-wea/	Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic nominee challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said that vast U.S. wealth differences show the economy doesn’t work for everyone. The El Paso congressman’s half-page ad, in the Houston Defender’s July 26, 2018, issue, shows O’Rourke shaking hands with an African-American man. Accompanying text says: "Our economy isn't working for everyone when black Americans have 10 times less wealth than white Americans. Let's level the playing field by ensuring access to good jobs, higher pay, skills training, and a fair shot at economic success." A reminder: Wealth is distinct from income. It measures how much we own, not how much we make. While the two are closely tied, economists talk about wealth in terms of net worth. A house, for example, adds to net worth if its value is higher than the amount of the mortgage. Assets minus debts gives you net worth. 2016 federal survey We asked O’Rourke’s campaign about the basis of O’Rourke’s "10 times less" claim in the ad, which had come to our attention in a Texas Tribune news story on O’Rourke’s advertising expenditures. By email, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign pointed out an October 2017 Washington Post Wonkblog story and other reports rooted in 2016 consumer survey data summed up by the Federal Reserve in fall 2017. That data, Evans told us, pegged the median net worth of white families at 10 times the median net worth of black families. The Wonkblog story says that according to the survey results, the "median net worth of white families — $171,000 — is now 10 times that of black families and eight times that of Hispanic families." A factor, the story says, is that "white families are five times more likely than black or Hispanic families to inherit money. That translates into opportunity — a down payment on a home, tuition to go to school, capital to build a small business, savings to retire on." Other factors, the story says, include distinct rates of home ownership and participation in job-related savings plans. Median and average wealth differences According to a pair of September 2017 Federal Reserve articles, the agency’s 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances reached 6,254 families with queries on households’ total pre-tax income, balance sheets, pensions, income and demographic characteristics. "No other study for the country collects comparable information," the agency says. The 2016 survey found about a 10-to-1 difference in the median wealth/net worth of white and black Americans--the ratio between $171,000 and $17,600. Net worth is defined as the difference between families' gross assets and their liabilities. The survey results otherwise suggest the difference in the average wealth of white and black Americans is nearly 7-to-1--$933,700 for white residents and $138,200 for black residents. (An equal number of households earn more and less than each median. Averages are based on adding up reported incomes and dividing by the number of households.) The Fed offered one other comparison: Nearly 1 in 5 black households reported zero or negative net worth compared to a smaller share of white households, 9 percent, the study says. Factors behind white-black difference We spotted a Fed chart specifying disparities by race identified in the survey in household income and by whether people reported owning homes and cars or having retirement accounts: SOURCE: Excerpted from chart in data analysis, "Recent Trends in Wealth-Holding by Race and Ethnicity: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances," FEDS Notes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Sept. 27, 2017 (accessed Aug. 17, 2018) As O’Rourke’s spokesman also noted, the Pew Research Center took a longer view of the wealth disparity singled out by O’Rourke. Pew’s November 2017 Fact Tank story says that according to the Fed’s surveys over the years, the wealth gap between white and black and Hispanic households shrank by about half from 2007 to 2016. The month before, another non-partisan entity, the Urban Institute, updated its charts drawing on the Fed’s surveys. For more than 50 years, the institute says, white families have outpaced black and Hispanic families in average wealth. We asked the institute to evaluate O’Rourke’s claim. The statement had the right spirit, we heard back, though Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow, offered a caveat in that the 2016 Fed survey suggests that black Americans had one-tenth the median wealth of whites, not 10 times less. Older survey A 2014 PunditFact fact-check led us to fetch what turned out to be older results from a different survey. In June 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau released its estimates of household net incomes attributed to its 2013 Survey of Income and Program Participation. Tables in the release suggest that white households at the time had median net worths of $103,796 and black households had net worths of $9,211--signaling an 11-to-1 ratio. White households had average net worths of $292,217, the bureau says, compared to $91,595 for black households--indicating a 3-to-1 ratio. Our ruling O’Rourke said that "black Americans have 10 times less wealth than white Americans." Survey results pinpoint two ways to gauge such disparities. According to the Fed’s 2016 consumer survey, black Americans had one-tenth the median wealth of white Americans while black Americans had a little over one-seventh the average wealth of white Americans.

pomt-01772	The United States is the leading nation in the world "with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/29/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-us-leads-world-climate-doubt/	After a 26-year crusade against "environmentalist wackos," Rush Limbaugh has emerged triumphant, according to the conservative radio host himself. Citing recent findings by market researchers Ipsos MORI, Limbaugh said on his July 22, 2014, radio show that the United States leads the pack in questioning climate change, and he’s taking all the credit. "Fifty-four percent of Americans agreed with the statement, 'The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity,’ " he said. "Why would the U.S. be the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change? Why do you think that would be? I think that's exactly right: Me. There's just no other explanation" Whether Limbaugh is giving praise where praise is due, we can’t know for sure. But we did want to check out his claim that America leads in climate change skepticism. Global lukewarming We’ll start with Limbaugh’s source. In its first-ever Global Trends Survey, Ipsos MORI used an online poll to survey roughly 32,000 adults in 20 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States.) Respondents were asked about their attitudes on climate change. The countries were then ranked by the percentage who agreed with the statement. Here’s how the U.S. fared: Statement Agree Disagree Ranking The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity 54% 32% 20 We’re headed for environmental disaster unless we change our habits quickly. 57.3% 31.5% 20 The climate change we are currently seeing is a natural phenomenon that happens from time to time 52% 35% 1(tie) I’m tired of the fuss made about the environment. 36% 54% 7 Companies do not pay enough attention to the environment 65% 22% 19 I try to recycle as much as I can. 76% 18% 14 Even the scientists don’t really know what they’re talking about when on environmental issues. 43% 43% 13 The government is just using environmental issues to raise taxes. 50% 35% 17 Based on the results, the United States had the lowest percentage of people say that climate change is: 1. Largely man-made, and 2. Leading the world toward environmental ruin. The United States also tied India for the highest percentage of people agree that climate change is a natural phenomenon that happens from time to time, though more Americans disagreed with the statement than Indians. All of that gives Limbaugh’s claim credence, though there are a couple of caveats. Ipsos MORI research director Bobby Duffy said Limbaugh’s conclusion that the United States is the most skeptical country is "probably too simple." While the numbers indicate that the United States is the least likely nation among those surveyed to see climate change as a man-made issue, the majority of Americans -- albeit, not by a huge margin -- still believe that climate change is anthropogenic. Moreover, Americans aren’t scoffing at the general idea of climate change. The United States ranked near the middle of the nations when asked if there is too much of a fuss made about the environment. And Americans recycle at average rates -- though Duffy noted recycling could be motivated by other concerns such as use of resources and socialization. Hockey stick gaffes The survey itself is somewhat limited. While more than 1,000 people were surveyed in some countries including the United States, other countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Sweden and Turkey included around 500 individuals. Duffy explained that this was due to client interest in the those markets, as Ipsos MORI is a market researcher. Who was surveyed is also important. Ipsos MORI said the survey was representative of the general adult population in "developed" (shorthand for greater Internet access) nations such as the United States. But in developing nations, Ispos said it surveyed a "more affluent and ‘connected’ population" to represent an emerging middle class, according to Duffy. To some pollsters, this method of surveying is problematic. It doesn’t make sense to compare the elites of one country to the general population of another, said University of Maryland public policy researcher Steven Kull. "If you’re looking at public opinion in a country, look at the country. If you want to look at a subset, look at a subset. Otherwise it’s apples to oranges," he said. Still, Ipsos’ findings are fairly consistent with the most recent Pew Research Center survey -- where 67 percent of Americans said that there is solid evidence of global warming, and 44 percent say it’s mostly due to human activity. A separate Pew Global poll found that when stacked up against 22 other countries, the United States was one of the least concerned about global warming, right under China and Britain and outranking only Poland and Pakistan. (Interestingly, Ipsos found that 91 percent of people in China said the world was heading for an environmental disaster unless we change our habits. Duffy said this can be explained again by the sampling approach and mode of interview.) One of the most comprehensive polls we found was Gallup’s 2010 survey of 111 countries. Though nearly all Americans were aware of global warming, 47 percent -- the largest percentage in the world -- said it was due to solely natural causes. About half said global warming was at least partly anthropogenic, a 12-percentage-point drop since the last Gallup poll in 2008. That’s slightly below the world’s average but far below the rates in developed countries. Lower percentages of belief in human-caused climate change in developing nations make sense, given correspondingly lower rates of awareness, education and literacy, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociologist at Oklahoma State University. But in the United States, it’s politics that is causing the skepticism. The ruling Limbaugh said that the United States is "the leading nation with the highest amount of doubt about the conventional wisdom of climate change." While he cites an exact figure reported by Ipsos MORI, the study itself doesn’t capture the belief of general populations, only those with an Internet connection. Other polls we looked at indicate that a good proportion of developing countries have higher rates of doubt. But among peers, the United States is one of the most -- if not, the most -- skeptical when it comes to believing climate change has human factors. We rate Limbaugh’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-06144	"Hydrogen sulfide . . . [was] used in the genocide of Jews in Germany. "	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/21/michael-chippendale/rhode-island-state-rep-michael-chippendale-says-hy/	It seems like there’s no escaping the noisome fumes wafting from the Central Landfill in Johnston. Rhode Islanders near and far have complained that the rotten-egg odor generated by decomposing organic waste is worse than ever. The concentration of hydrogen sulfide, the gas that causes the smell, has been classified by the state Department of Health at the "nuisance" level. And the gas certainly is a nuisance. But is it also a threat to public health? At a recent public forum at Johnston High School, state Rep. Michael W. Chippendale claimed that it is. A very serious one, at that. After outlining the various health consequences that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists for exposure to hydrogen sulfide -- ranging from eye irritation at low levels to convulsions and death at high levels -- the Foster Republican made a claim at the Dec. 16 meeting that was hard to ignore. "Hydrogen sulfide is, from just a brief search of the CDC’s website, one of the nastiest components, or chemical components, of some of the nastiest things that we’ve ever encountered in the world, including -- and I don’t want to sound overly dramatic if I haven’t already -- but including the actual chemicals used in the genocide of Jews in Germany," said Chippendale, a member of a legislative commission appointed to look into the stink from the landfill. No doubt it’s a dramatic statement. Any reference to the Holocaust is bound to be. But is it true? We called Chippendale, who guessed correctly why we wanted to talk to him. He was also quick to say that he thought he misspoke. "It appears that I may have read things out of order," he said. Chippendale said he prepared some notes before the forum that included comments on the health effects of hydrogen sulfide exposure and the statement related to Nazi gas chambers. But there was supposed to be a transition between the two topics, explaining that the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide is similar to the toxicity of another gas, hydrogen cyanide. Chippendale said that when he spoke at the meeting, he mixed up his notes, so it wasn’t until after he mentioned the Holocaust that he drew the comparison between the toxicity of hydrogen sulfide and that of hydrogen cyanide. And that’s where the problem arose. According to the CDC web page Chippendale used as a source, "hydrogen cyanide, under the name Zyklon B, was used as a genocidal agent by the Germans in World War II." Again, that’s hydrogen cyanide, not hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide has been found at the landfill; hydrogen cyanide has not. We decided to do more research on hydrogen sulfide and its history. Was it ever used by the Germans in World War II or as a chemical weapon by anyone else? And is its toxicity really comparable to hydrogen cyanide? Our first stop was the CDC website that Chippendale went to. In all the documents on hydrogen sulfide on the site, we found no reference to the Germans using the gas in World War II. We then contacted Stephen L. Morgan, a chemistry professor at the University of South Carolina who has taught courses on the history of chemical warfare. His reaction to Chippendale’s statement at the forum? "I think he’s confused," he said. Morgan found two references to hydrogen sulfide’s use as a chemical weapon in World War I, but not in World War II. But that doesn’t mean that the gas can’t be dangerous under certain conditions. According to the CDC, hydrogen sulfide "naturally occurs in the gases from volcanoes, sulfur springs, undersea vents, swamps and stagnant bodies of water and in crude petroleum and natural gas." It also results from the decomposition of organic matter and can be found at wastewater treatment plants, landfills, slaughterhouses, petroleum refineries and other industrial facilities. When levels are high enough, it can cause illness and, in some instances, death. According to the Rhode Island Department of Health, levels higher than 10 parts per million are unhealthy. Levels higher than 100 parts per million can trigger evacuation. The "Handbook of Environmental Data on Organic Chemicals" by Karel Verschueren says immediate death results from a level higher than 800 parts per million. The CDC lists a number of incidents in which people have died from exposure to high levels of hydrogen sulfide. In fact, in 2001, a fisherman died on a Rhode Island boat and two others were injured after breathing in hydrogen sulfide inside the vessel’s hold. The gas concentrations measured during visits to neighborhoods near the Central Landfill and at a fixed monitoring station at Wood Lake Park in Johnston have so far been far less than 1 part per million, according to Barbara Morin, supervising environmental scientist at the state Department of Environmental Management. "It’s not at a level that’s going to poison anybody," she said. Our ruling There’s no question that in confined conditions and at extremely high concentrations hydrogen sulfide can be dangerous. There are recorded instances of people dying from exposure to the gas. But we could find no record of the Germans using it in their gas chambers during World War II. Rep. Chippendale made a statement that was sure to draw attention. "My sole intent was to make the point and drive it home with as strong a use of terms as I possibly could while remaining factually accurate," he told us. But he wasn’t accurate. Give him credit for admitting that without much fuss. Nevertheless, we should all be more careful when trying to make a connection to something as emotionally charged as the Holocaust. We rule the statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-12218	"Kim Jong Un dead: North Koreans calling Trump an assassin"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/20/blog-posting/its-fake-news-american-killed-north-koreas-leader-/	A report that Kim Jong Un is dead and that it was an American sniper who killed him is fake news, despite an alarming headline and short story posted on dailysidnews.com. A July 6, 2017, post headlined, "Kim Jong Un dead: North Koreans calling Trump an assassin," claims the North Korean leader died "of an apparent high-powered gunshot wound to the head" and that state media reports the "bullet came from the sniper rifle of an American positioned more than a mile away." Though the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is secretive and the government controls information and the media, there have been no reports by international independent, official news organizations of Kim Jong Un’s death. United Press International reported that according to state-run Korean Central News Agency, Kim Jong Un on July 8 — two days after dailysidnews.com’s post — visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang to pay respects to his biological grandfather, who died July 8, 1994. Dailysidnews.com claims that the report of Kim Jong Un’s death follows North Korea’s successful test of a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach Alaska and possibly Hawaii. "Trump promised swift and appropriate action. This seems to be it. Liberals will cry murder and say we don’t have the right just before they remind us of how many civilians died in Iraq when a president refused to use a single bullet to end Saddam Hussein and instead dragged us to war for a decade," the post said. North Korea on July 4 reportedly launched an intercontinental ballistic missile and U.S. officials estimated its range of 3,400 miles was capable of hitting Alaska, CNN reported. But the dailysidnews.com website raises a lot of questions about its own legitimacy. There’s no information in its "About Us" page; a "Contact Us" page lists phony information, including an invalid email address and a nonfunctional phone number. The website’s "Terms and Conditions" page includes a line that says, "By operating the Website, Daily Sid News does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful." The same July 6 post also appears on thelastlineofdefense.org, a website that says everything it posts is "a satirical work of fiction." Variations of the story are posted on other sites, including ourlandofthefree.com, which says it makes "no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not." Dailysidnews.com’s report the North Korean leader is dead and that an American killed him is not true, but rather a fabrication. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-08002	"Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/14/mike-haridopolos/florida-senate-president-warns-education-funding-c/	A budget storm is brewing in Tallahassee, and Senate President Mike Haridopolos is making clear that no agency, program or area may be spared from impending cuts. Haridopolos, R-Merritt Island, met with reporters on Jan. 12, 2011, to offer his outlook regarding Florida's $3.62 billion budget shortfall for the coming fiscal year. Haridopolos predicted that it would be difficult to pursue any significant tax cuts -- like those being championed by Gov. Rick Scott -- and that everyone should expect spending cuts. That includes education funding, he warned. More than $3 billion in federal stimulus funds have helped the state fill education budget holes for the past two years, but those funds sunset this spring. And while some additional federal funds are coming available, about $555 million, Florida's budget picture remains bleak, Haridopolos said. "Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education," Haridopolos was quoted as saying in the Orlando Sentinel. "It's a very difficult spot to be in, and the reason we wanted to make the adjustments to the class-size amendment" defeated by voters in November. Haridopolos was referring to an amendment proposed by the Legislature to ease class-size requirements at Florida schools so the state could save money. That measure failed to receive the needed 60 percent voter approval to pass. For this fact check, we decided to zero in on Haridopolos' claim that half of state general revenue goes to fund education. Understanding the state budget and education funding In his claim, Haridopolos is talking about a subset of the state budget, which is a subset of state's share of education funding in Florida, which is a subset of overall education funding in Florida. Oh, and he's not just talking about K-12 spending, but also state spending on the state university system, pre-Kindergarten and student aid programs. We'll walk you through it. Let's start with the state budget, which you can imagine by picturing a three-legged stool. Leg one: General revenue (what Haridopolos is talking about). General revenue makes up about 34 percent of the current state budget. The money mostly comes from sales taxes -- though some comes from telephone and cable taxes, corporate income taxes (which Scott has vowed to phase out), and taxes on property transactions. The state has broad discretion on how general revenue is spent. Leg two: State trust funds. State trust funds make up about 27 percent of the current state budget. That is money collected by the state to be used for a specific purpose. The state gas tax is funneled into a transportation trust fund, for example, to pay for road building projects. Florida Lottery proceeds roll into the Educational Enhancement Trust Fund. (The Legislature, at times, has raided trust funds to help balance the budget.) Leg three: Federal dollars. Federal dollars this year comprise about 39 percent of the state budget. Federal dollars primarily fund the state's Medicaid program, but also help fund education, road projects and the criminal justice system. So while each leg helps fund education programs from pre-K through college, Haridopolos is focusing on the general revenue fund. In the current budget, 56 percent of all state education spending came out of general revenue, and it's the portion of state spending the Legislature can most easily control. Now, here's a second important primer. The state doesn't fund education all by itself. Hardly. Local school districts contribute billions of dollars on their own through local property taxes. Most of those property taxes, believe it or not, are set at rates mandated by the Legislature through something called the Required Local Effort. In short, school districts are forced to collect the amount of property taxes the Legislature decides, or the districts won't get to share in state funding. In addition, there are other property taxes individual school districts have discretion over. None of those funds are technically state revenues for the purpose of this analysis. If this isn't confusing enough already, the context of Haridopolos' statement also is important. He's talking about potential cuts in education funding because of less federal dollars and lower sales tax receipts that are affecting the state's bottom line. One way to offset those cuts would be to raise the Required Local Effort, but the Republican-led Legislature that sets the tax has been opposed to that idea. Drilling down on general revenue Now, sticking to Haridopolos' statement and examining only general revenue, the Senate president is correct. Of the $23.8 billion of general revenue budgeted to be spent between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2011, $12.5 billion was directed to education -- pre-K through college. Divide one into the other and you see that education spending currently equals more than 52 percent of general revenue. You can see the full breakdown of general revenue spending on Page 5 of this report. Haridopolos spokesman David Bishop said the state expects to receive $22.6 billion in general revenue for the 2011-2012 fiscal year. If you look at the overall state budget, education funding made up about 32 percent ($22.4 billion) of the entire $70 billion state budget in 2010-2011. Ruling As Haridopolos talked in Tallahassee about the grim state budget prospects for this coming year, he said state education funding might see cuts. Part of the problem is just how much of the budget is tied to education funding, he said -- half of the state's general revenue fund. To be honest, Florida's education funding structure is way more complicated than Haridopolos let on. But he's right that the state general revenue fund, which is a little more than a third of the overall state budget, is being used primarily to fund education. We rate this statement True.

pomt-11757	Says "$3 trillion in offshore money... is coming back into the economy" because of the GOP tax bills.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/05/chris-ruddy/gop-tax-bill-overseas-profits-beware-hype/	The House and Senate tax bills are a boon to American multinational companies that have booked trillions of dollars in profits overseas. Funds claimed by the companies would see tax rates well below even the much-reduced 20 percent corporate rate in the proposed bills. On the Senate side, companies would face a 14.5 percent tax on money they had been holding as cash or securities, and for money invested in hard assets, the rate could be as low as 7.5 percent. Chris Ruddy, CEO of the conservative website Newsmax, cast this as a flood of money "three times the Obama stimulus" that would "drive the economy for the next 10 years." "I think after this tax bill, it's actually going to be a watershed, because $3 trillion in offshore money, forget about the individual and corporate tax rates, $3 trillion of all that Apple money is coming back into the economy," Ruddy said on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Dec. 3. (Apple and Google are the poster children of overseas cash, but there are many others, from General Electric to Pfizer to Coca-Cola.) We took a closer look at Ruddy’s claim that "$3 trillion in offshore money ... is coming into the economy." Ruddy’s statement is part prediction — the money will juice the economy — and part statement of fact — there’s $3 trillion out there waiting to come into the American economy. Recent history gives reasons to doubt whether the first part will come true, but we don’t fact-check predictions. We can, however, look at whether that money is outside the American economy, as Ruddy said. Ruddy told us that he got his $3 trillion figure from a New York Times article, which said the Senate and House plans would "allow companies to bring nearly $3 trillion in profits home." Where things get tricky is where that money is today. There’s considerable evidence that a large chunk of it, a bit under one-half, already is in the U.S. economy. When a Senate committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations surveyed 27 American multinational corporations in 2011, it found that about 46 percent of tax-deferred foreign earnings were in "in U.S. bank accounts or invested in U.S. assets such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S. stocks other than their own, U.S. bonds, or U.S. mutual funds." The investment research firm Moody’s calculated that in 2017, foreign subsidiaries of American multinationals held about $1.4 trillion in cash or marketable securities. With estimates of total overseas profits ranging from $2.6 trillion to $3.1 trillion, tax lawyer Steven Rosenthal at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center said "40 percent or so is about right" for the share of profits in the United States. In an October tax note, Goldman Sachs economists wrote that thanks to those holdings, offshore profits are "largely available for domestic activities." There’s no dispute that "companies can invest offshore funds in U.S. markets," said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College. Under American law, any money made on those investments is taxable, but the underlying cash remains outside the reach of the IRS. Ruddy told us "even if it’s in a U.S. bank account, they can’t use it for U.S. operations, as far as I understand." Ruddy has a point, but nothing keeps the money on the other side of the border. And once it’s put into the economy, it moves around as loans or equity investments in companies that seek to expand. That’s how the U.S. Treasury Department saw it just before President Donald Trump took office. In making the case for tax reform, the department’s Office of Tax Policy said that it is "a common misconception" offshore profits must remain outside the United States. "While there are limitations on how those funds may be used by the corporation, in general those assets are held for investment at U.S. financial institutions, and thus contribute to investment and capital formation in the United States," they wrote. American multinationals can also use this to effectively bring home money virtually tax-free, according to Edward Kleinbard, professor of tax law at the University of Southern California’s Gould School of Law and former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation Kleinbard described to lawmakers on the House Ways and Means Committee Feb. 24, 2016, how Apple floated a $12 billion bond in 2016: "The interest expense will be fully deductible by Apple, and its enormous hoard of foreign earnings will continue to grow." In fact, Kleinbard said the tax deduction on the interest paid on the bond could largely offset the interest earned by Apple’s offshore cash invested in America. "In that case, the principal of the bond offering will be the economic equivalent of a tax-free repatriation – in this case of $12 billion," Kleinbard said. Kleinbard also told us that some of the overseas profits have already ended up in foreign brick-and-mortar projects. "Those investments aren’t picking up and moving to the U.S.," he said. "If you are a global business, of course you need at least some real investments throughout the world." Kleinbard’s rough estimate is that about half of the offshore profits are in cash and other liquid assets, and the other half are in "real investments in non-U.S. businesses." Our ruling Ruddy said that $3 trillion in offshore money could come into the American economy under the Republican tax bills. That assumes that all of that money is overseas and readily available. Neither assumption is accurate. A 2011 Senate study found that a bit under half of offshore profits are already in the United States in the form of bank accounts or investments in bonds or stocks. Investment firms and independent researchers generally agree that the fraction hovers around 40 to 45 percent of all overseas profits. The consensus is that a change in tax law would not inject a flood of new money into the economy because it is already here. A large portion of the other half is tied up in actual projects in businesses overseas. Ruddy’s notion that $3 trillion is sitting there available for use falls wide of the facts. Some portion would be freed up, but not more than that. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-05836	"Romney adviser admits Romneycare was blueprint for Obamacare."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/16/rick-santorum/rombo-ad-rick-santorum-says-mitt-romney-adviser-eq/	In the run-up to the Michigan primary, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum released a television ad titled "Rombo" that portrayed rival Mitt Romney as a gun-toting mudslinger. In the ad, a Romney look-alike, clad in a pitch-perfect white dress shirt and a tie, aims a paintball gun at cardboard cutouts of Santorum, hoping to cover them with mud. The visuals made the ad an instant classic, but the ad’s substance has received less attention in the media. We thought we’d look at one of the ad’s claims. One of the on-screen visuals said, "Romney adviser admits Romneycare was blueprint for Obamacare." Is that correct? First, we should note that we’ve looked at previous claims that Romney’s health care law and Obama’s were similar and have found them to be generally accurate. To check the claim in the ad, we first turmed to the cited source for the claim, a transcript from rushlimbaugh.com. During his Oct. 13, 2011, show, the conservative talker discussed an appearance the previous night by Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber on MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. We located the transcript for that episode of O’Donnell’s show. Here are some excerpts: O’Donnell: One of Gov. Romney's health care reform consultants was MIT economist Jonathan Gruber. He attended five of the 12 meetings at the Obama White House in 2009, including the meeting with the president. Joining me now, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Jonathan Gruber. Thanks for joining me tonight, professor. Gruber: You bet, Lawrence. Good to be here. O’Donnell: All right. Come on, come clean. You were in the room with President Obama discussing health care reform. And you did, in fact, work with the Romney administration in Massachusetts. Come on, professor, you have to tell us the truth. Gruber: The truth is that the Affordable Care Act is essentially based on what we accomplished in Massachusetts. It's the same basic structure applied nationally. John McDonough (the executive director of Health Care For All, a Massachusetts consumer health advocacy organization and) one of the other advisers who worked in both Massachusetts and advised the White House, said it's the Massachusetts bill with three more zeros. That's basically a good description of what the federal bill did. O’Donnell: It is kind of laughable that we've actually reach the point where we have the great investigative reporter Michael Isikoff actually going in there to get these kind of diary facts in the White House to sort of prove what we all know. I want you to listen to what Mitt Romney had to say when he was signing the bill in Massachusetts. (In video clip) Mitt Romney: I want to thank the many, many people in this room who were critical to crafting and coaxing the bold health care initiative that I'm about to sign. Jonathan Gruber at MIT devoted hours and hours to an essential econometric model. O’Donnell: That's for the econometric model, professor. He didn't mention you last night in his answer, when he was asked about, you know, who helped him and who helped President Obama? Gruber: I'm hurt, Lawrence. I think I'll live. So, Romney’s hat-tip in the signing ceremony confirms that Gruber helped put together portions of the Massachusetts health care bill. And we think it’s fair to use the term "blueprint" to describe Gruber’s comment that "the truth is that the Affordable Care Act is essentially based on what we accomplished in Massachusetts. It's the same basic structure applied nationally." The ad’s only failing is not describing Gruber as a "former adviser." Gruber is not advising Romney’s presidential run, but one could easily think so when reading the screen text. We checked with Gruber to see what he thought. "Yes, that is pretty much right, if you add that I’m a former Romney adviser," he said. He added a bit of praise for the ad-maker. "It’s funny, at the start of the ad, I thought the guy didn't look like Romney -- too muscular -- but from the angles at the end of the ad, he did look a lot like him." Our ruling According to the ad, a "Romney adviser admits Romneycare was blueprint for Obamacare." Stick a "former" in front of "Romney adviser" and it would have been correct. As it is, we’ll downgrade it slightly to Mostly True.

pomt-05046	The health care law is "the largest tax [increase] in the history of our country"	false	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/11/phil-gingrey/gingrey-claim-about-obama-health-care-old-inaccura/	Opponents of President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation are rushing to turn his recent victory before the U.S. Supreme Court into a defeat at the ballot box this November. The court ruled June 28 that the law’s requirement that certain people buy health insurance is constitutional under federal taxing powers. The decision gave Republicans a chance to repeat a claim that the bill is a tax of historic proportions. U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta joined the chorus the day the court released its decision to uphold the mandate during an interview on American Public Media’s radio show "Marketplace." It airs on WABE-FM, Atlanta’s local National Public Radio station. Gingrey said he wouldn’t care to have a beer with Supreme Court Justice John Roberts. "I'd like to pour one on his head," Gingrey quipped. He also complained that the bill is a whopper of a tax. "This indeed is the largest tax [increase] in the history of our country," Gingrey said. Politicians and pundits have been using different versions of this talking point for years, and we’ve often ruled it False or worse. The latest such statement PolitiFact rated came from conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who earned a Pants on Fire for saying "Obamacare is ... the largest tax increase in the history of the world." It’s not even the largest in American history, PolitiFact ruled. PolitiFact Georgia contacted Gingrey’s office for answers. Before we evaluate his response, let’s review the reasoning behind our prior rulings. Hold tight. It’s complicated. The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, broke down the tax impact of the health care law from 2010 to 2019. Over the next 10 years, the plan would raise hundreds of billions of dollars through measures such as a Medicare payroll tax increase, new taxes on certain medical devices and so-called "Cadillac" health care plans, and an annual fee on health insurance providers. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health care law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenue coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019. Is this the biggest tax increase in American history? We turned to a method employed by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940 to 2006. Tempalski used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation. He measured the impact of the increase by calculating the increase in revenue as a percentage of the U.S.’ gross domestic product. He typically used estimates from immediately after the laws went into effect. Calculations for 1940-1967 should be viewed with some caution, he said, because revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent. Here are Tempalski’s top five tax increases from 1940 to 2006: 1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP 2. Revenue Act of 1961: 2.2 percent of GDP 3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP 4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP 5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: 0.97 percent of GDP The 2010 health care law wasn’t included in the list, so we calculated our own percent of GDP figure. We chose 2019 as our base line. That’s when the bill’s tax provisions go into full effect. The CBO estimates that in 2019, the government will see increased revenue of $104 billion, including the penalty paid by people who decline to buy health insurance. We divided that number into the CBO’s gross domestic product projection for 2019, which is $21.164 trillion. The result: 0.49 percent of total GDP. The health care bill doesn’t even crack Tempalski’s top five. Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber countered that the CBO’s 2010 long-term budget outlook says Obama’s health care law will increase revenue to 1.2 percent of GDP by 2035. That would catapult the tax to near the top of the list. But that projection is for more than two decades from now. The accuracy of revenue and GDP projections plummet the further into the future they go. Second, Gingrey’s number is not comparable to those in Tempalski’s ranking. Tempalski’s calculation compares revenue estimates for years immediately after the new tax law goes into effect, not a generation out. In addition, Gingrey cherry-picks favorable statistics while ignoring the most up-to-date information. The CBO’s 2012 projections show Obama’s health care bill will increase tax revenue by far less -- 0.8 percent. Make no mistake about it -- this is still a huge tax increase. And there are a lot of unknowns as the program is implemented. But Gingrey went further than that. He said it is the "largest tax" increase in the nation’s history. PolitiFact ruled previously that Obama’s health care bill is not the largest tax increase in U.S. history. That ruling stands. Gingrey earns a False.

pomt-12383	"ISIS is infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it."	false	/georgia/statements/2017/jun/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/isis-infiltrating-america-and-using-syrians-do-it/	In the hard-fought special election to fill a vacant, Atlanta-area congressional seat, a Republican group’s ad blares the alarm about terrorism on U.S. soil. In the ad, the National Republican Congressional Committee charges Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff with being soft on terrorism. "ISIS is infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it," the ad’s narrator says in a steely voice. "The FBI warned we can't safely screen every Syrian. Yet Jon Ossoff's liberal party bosses brought 10,000 Syrian refugees to America. And Ossoff supports their dangerous Iran nuclear deal allowing billions for the leading sponsor of terrorism. Billions that will fund terror. While terrorists infiltrate and attack with our safety at risk, Jon Ossoff is just too risky." Just in case you didn’t get the point, the ad uses lots of not-very-subtle footage of facemask-wearing terrorists, burning American flags and the like. We’ve checked some portions of this narration previously -- the part about the FBI warnings on screenings got a Half True, for instance, and the part about the Iran nuclear deal funding terrorism also got a Half True. Here, we’ll look at the opening line -- that "ISIS is infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it." We found solid reasons to be dubious of this claim. What does "infiltrate" mean? The ad contends, twice, that ISIS supporters are "infiltrating" the United States from Syria in order to commit terrorist acts. The big problem with that claim: To date, there is not a single documented case of that happening. Nor are there any documented cases that come reasonably close to that description. "There’s no sliver of truth here," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism specialist at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. "It’s simply a false statement." There is one area of the world where Syrian ISIS infiltration might be taking place. ISIS members posing as refugees from Syria can make their way to central and western Europe either over land or by boat from the Mediterranean. But that’s not the case for the United States, the locale that’s clearly the subject of the NRCC ad. For entering the United States, "ISIS infiltration is not very efficient," Gartenstein-Ross said. It’s not that the screening process is perfect, he said, but rather a question of math. "The refugee-selection process is designed to select very few military-age, single males, and even if you fit the criteria, the odds are still not good that you’ll get selected" to go to the United States, he said. And before gaining entry to the United States, you are likely to have a long wait in a refugee camp. (We’ve previously looked at the composition of refugees by age and sex here.) NRCC spokeswoman Maddie Anderson argued for the ad’s accuracy by saying that in addition to physical infiltration, "ISIS is also infiltrating us with their ideology by seeking to inspire lone wolf attacks here from afar. The domestic terrorists have gotten their ideas and been inspired by what’s going on in the Middle East." We have no objection to the argument that ISIS is inspiring lone-wolf terrorists -- the list below is chock full of examples. But the ad didn’t urge efforts to combat ideological propaganda on social media. It used the phrase "terrorists infiltrate" and referred to Syrian refugee admissions -- of humans, not ideas. So the ad gives a very different impression than the one Anderson was arguing. The closest examples don’t involve Syrians The rare instances in which an adult entered the United States and later went on to commit a terrorist act don’t apply to what the ad said about Syrians. The closest example might be the case of two Iraqi immigrants, Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, who were arrested in 2011 in a sting in Bowling Green, Ky. Before coming to the United States, Alwan had made bombs that allegedly targeted American military personnel in Iraq. So he was a terrorist before coming to the United States, and he did enter -- "infiltrate" -- the country. But he came to the United States before ISIS existed, and before the beginning of the civil war that triggered an influx of displaced Syrians. Another example involves Egyptian national Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, the perpetrator of a 2002 mass shooting at the Los Angeles airport. Prior to his immigration to the United States, Egyptian authorities accused him of belonging to the terrorist organization Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (though he denied this charge). The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. This attack pre-dates the dynamic in Syria by a decade and a half. Among more recent perpetrators, Tashfeen Malik, half of the married couple behind the 2015 San Bernardino shootings, came in on a marriage visa. But she was a Pakistani who had come most recently from Saudi Arabia -- not Syria. She pledged loyalty to ISIS shortly before the attack. Self-radicalization is more common However, far more common than "infiltration" cases are examples of self-radicalization by people already in the United States, mostly people who were born and/or raised in America. Often, they are driven to terrorism by propaganda and social media networks, and sometimes they pledge loyalty to ISIS before committing an attack. Some examples of self-radicalization since the 9/11 attacks: • Seattle Jewish Federation shooting. In July 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. He was a U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent who grew up in Washington state. • University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill attack. In March 2006, UNC graduate Mohammad Reza Taheri-azar drove an SUV onto campus, injuring nine pedestrians. He was born in Iran but entered the United States as a young child and was a naturalized U.S. citizen. • Little Rock recruiting station shooting. In 2009, Abdulhakim Muhammed pleaded guilty to killing Pvt. William Long and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula during a shooting outside a U.S. Army recruiting station in Little Rock, Ark. Born as Carlos Bledsoe and reared as a Baptist in Memphis, Tenn., he was a convert to Islam. • Fort Hood shooting. In 2009, Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, went on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, that left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded. Hasan was of Palestinian descent, but he was born in Virginia and was a U.S. citizen. • The "underwear bomber." In 2009, Umar Farook Abdulmutallab became known as the "underwear bomber" on Dec. 25, 2009, after he tried to blow up a plane flying to Detroit using a bomb strapped to his underwear. Unlike others on this list, he did not try to settle in the United States but rather boarded a U.S.-bound flight overseas. • Times Square bombing. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad tried to plant a bomb in Times Square in New York City. He did come to the United States to be a student, but he was from a prominent Pakistani military family, and he appears to have radicalized after arriving in the United States. • Boston Marathon bombing. In 2013, brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev carried out twin explosive device attacks at the Boston Marathon, killing three spectators and injuring more than 260 people. The brothers came to the United States as children after their parents fled Chechnya. They arrived in the United States on tourist visas, and then their family applied for asylum. Dzhokhar became a U.S. citizen on Sept. 11, 2012, while Tamerlan had a green card and had applied for citizenship. • Queens hatchet attack. In 2014, Zale H. Thompson injured two New York City police officers using a metal hatchet. Police officials said Thompson was a self-radicalized convert to Islam. • Chattanooga shooting. In 2015, Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez shot and killed five people at two military sites Chattanooga. Abdulazeez was born in Kuwait but moved with his family to the United States as an infant, and he became a naturalized citizen. The FBI said the shooter was inspired by foreign terrorist propaganda. • San Bernardino shootings. The other half of the married couple that carried out the 2015 attack -- Syed Rizwan Farook -- was a U.S. citizen. His parents had emigrated from Pakistan to Chicago, and Farook was born in the United States and raised in California. • Orlando Pulse shootings. In 2016, Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in an Orlando nightclub shooting. He was born in the United States to Afghan immigrant parents. • New York-New Jersey bombings. In 2016, three bombs exploded in New York City and New Jersey, injuring at least 30 people. The alleged perpetrator, Ahmad Khan Rahimi, was born in Afghanistan but came to the United States at age 7 and became a U.S. citizen. • Ohio State university attack. In 2016, Abdul Razal Ali Artan allegedly injured 13 in an attack on the campus of Ohio State University. Artan, an Ohio State student, came to the United States from Somalia as a child and was a legal permanent resident. Bottom line: In most of the terrorist attacks attempted on U.S. soil since 9/11, the perpetrator has either been born in the United States or brought here as a child. Typically, the perpetrator has been influenced by propaganda and gone through a process of self-radicalization inside the United States. "As far as I know, there is not a single example of a refugee or any other immigrant from Syria committing an act of terrorism in the U.S.," said Barnett Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. "If ISIS is trying to attack the U.S. by infiltrating Syrian terrorists, it has completely failed." Our ruling The ad said that "ISIS is infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it." ISIS may dream of carrying out this plan, but there is zero evidence so far of it having worked. In the few examples since 2001 of an "infiltration" leading to a terror attack, they have not involved ISIS terrorists from Syria. Indeed, the ad’s focus on infiltration amounts to misdirection from a concern that’s more worrisome to terrorism experts -- self-radicalization by people born in America or brought here as youngsters.

pomt-13858	"Rather than work to secure the border, (Marco Rubio) supported Obama’s amnesty plan for illegal immigrants."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/08/carlos-beruff/carlos-beruff-wrongly-attacks-marco-rubios-record-/	Marco Rubio’s Republican rival for the Senate says that Rubio sided with President Barack Obama on amnesty, rather than protecting the border from undocumented immigrants as Donald Trump vows to do. Bradenton businessman Carlos Beruff sent a statement to the media July 5 blasting Rubio on immigration: "When faced with increasing threats to Americans, what did Marco Rubio do? Rather than work to secure the border, he supported Obama’s amnesty plan for illegal immigrants, endearing him to the Washington establishment in his bid for president. It’s clear that ISIS and others intent on doing us harm will use any means necessary, including our Southern border, to enter this country." Beruff then praised Trump’s immigration plan. Beruff’s campaign argues that Rubio supported a plan that would have immediately legalized immigrants without guarantees of border security. That’s distorting the facts. The legislation Rubio helped draft had multiple hurdles to permanent legal status and had extensive border security measures -- and funding for them. The Rubio campaign declined to comment. Border security and the 2013 immigration bill Beruff spokesman Chris Hartline said he was referring to the 2013 immigration bill that Rubio co-authored along with a group of senators dubbed the "Gang of Eight." The bill passed the Senate, but House leadership refused to allow it to reach a vote, so it died. Obama supported it. Border security was a significant part of the bill. It called for billions for border enforcement for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. Rubio played an active role in negotiating an amendment that included the beefed up security measures. The federal government had to start implementing border security plans -- but didn’t have to finish it -- before it could process applications for what the bill called "registered provisional immigrant status" or RPI. That wasn’t the same as lawful permanent resident status, but it would allow as proponents said, for undocumented immigrants to "come out of the shadows" and legally work here for years. The legislation wasn’t strictly amnesty, either. It set out a 13-year path with significant hurdles such as fines, background checks and waiting periods. That would have granted a certain level of legal status to "millions of illegal immigrants on day one," Hartline said. But those on RPI status couldn’t move to lawful permanent status until six months after the Homeland Security Secretary certified to the president and Congress that it had achieved multiple triggers in the border security plan. Those triggers included additional border patrol agents, 350 miles of extra fencing, an entry/exit tracking system and required employers to use an employment verification system. "The Senate legislation had quite significant teeth in it, requiring demonstrable progress on border enforcement before the two-stage legalization process could take place, with most unauthorized immigrants needing to wait at least 10 years before they could apply for a green card," said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute. But Beruff’s campaign argues that the bill didn’t prioritize border security and points to a statement by Rubio that legalization would come before border security: "First comes legalization, then comes this border security measure and then comes the permanent residency process," Rubio said in a June 9, 2013, interview with Univision. "What we are talking about here is the permanent residency system. Regarding legalization, a vast majority of my colleagues have already accepted that: that it must take place and that it must start at the same time we start with what has to do with security." The border security provisions were contingent on the Obama administration following through, Hartline said. And Rubio himself later said while running for president that "the American people do not trust the federal government to enforce our immigration laws." However, the bill set aside a $46.3 billion designated pot of money -- the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Trust Fund -- for border security. The Beruff campaign also notes that after the bill died, Rubio changed his strategy and called for a piecemeal approach of multiple bills with border security first. That’s true, but it doesn’t mean that the original bill lacked border security measures. Experts disagreed on whether Rubio’s shift in tactics was a substantial change or not; however, experts we interviewed about Beruff’s statement said that the 2013 bill clearly had border security in it. Kevin Johnson, dean of the law school at University of California at Davis, said it’s wrong to suggest that the 2013 bill lacked border security. "Rubio supported a compromise bill that did provide for more enforcement and a path to legalization for some undocumented immigrants," he said. Since Rubio voted in favor of border security enhancements, "it is incorrect to assert that Senator Rubio failed to secure the border," said Stephen Yale-Loehr, professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School. Our ruling Beruff said, "Rather than work to secure the border, (Rubio) supported Obama’s amnesty plan for illegal immigrants." Beruff is flat-out wrong about Rubio’s efforts to secure the border and misleads when he calls the 2013 bill "amnesty." Rubio co-authored the 2013 bill (which was the work of the Senate, not from the White House) that included extensive border security measures such as more border patrol agents and fencing. It’s an exaggeration to call that bill amnesty because while it included a path to citizenship, undocumented immigrants had to pass multiple hurdles. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2b5d15eb-219c-49e5-bb33-afe4e7152e65	None	Carlos Beruff	None	None	None	2016-07-08T10:19:38	2016-07-05	['Marco_Rubio', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-02617	"After years of 5.5 percent average tuition increases, we now have a two-year tuition freeze for the first time in the history of the UW System."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/23/scott-walker/wisconsin-college-tuition-average-increases-55-nev/	One accomplishment Gov. Scott Walker claimed Jan. 22, 2014 in his State of the State speech is of particular interest to students attending college in the University of Wisconsin System. And their parents. "After years of 5.5 percent average tuition increases," Walker said, "we now have a two-year tuition freeze for the first time in the history of the UW System." This is likely a statement Walker will repeat as the campaign for the November 2014 gubernatorial election picks up steam. Knowing that tuition rates vary among the different UW System institutions -- four-year universities vs two-year colleges, for example -- we wondered if the increases have averaged 5.5 percent and if there has never before been a two-year tuition freeze. The system The UW System is made up of 13 four-year universities, 13 freshman-sophomore colleges and the statewide UW-Extension. Altogether, the system serves some 181,000 students each year and employs more than 39,000 faculty and staff, with an annual budget of $6 billion. The system was created in 1974 by a law that merged the state’s two public university systems under an 18-member Board of Regents. That board -- 16 members are appointed by the governor and two are state school officials -- sets tuition. Generally speaking, the regents request that 65 percent of instructional funding come from state general fund money and the remaining 35 percent from tuition. Freezing Before we dive into the numbers, it’s important to note there are four tuition rates within the UW System: one for UW-Madison; one for UW-Milwaukee; one for the other four-year schools, such as Superior, Eau Claire and La Crosse; and one for the two-year colleges, such as UW-Fox Valley and UW-Waukesha. The two-year tuition freeze Walker highlighted in his speech has gotten plenty of news coverage. It was included in his 2013-’15 state budget, which became law in June 2013. The governor had proposed the freeze the previous month amid anger over how the UW System cash reserves had grown in recent years even as tuition kept increasing. A table listing tuition rates that was posted by the UW System in January 2014 shows that once before, in 2000-’01, there was an across-the-board freeze for all four tuition rates. There have never been back-to-back, across-the-board tuition freezes until the current one, which covers 2013-’14 and 2014-’15. But for the two-year colleges, tuition was locked for four straight years, from 2007-’08 through 2010-’11. 5.5 percent As for the 5.5 percent part of Walker’s claim, here's a look at each of the four rates. UW-Madison: Tuition rose 7.9 percent to $9,273 in 2012-’13, the table shows. Over the previous five years, tuition increases ranged between 5.5 percent to 9.73 percent. That includes a base tuition increase of 5.5 percent each year, plus an additional "differential" approved by the regents and UW-Madison students, UW System spokesman David Giroux told us. Money from differentials, which are also done by other UW campuses, gets targeted to needs such as high-demand classes that need more instructors, he said. UW-Milwaukee: Tuition rose 5.5 percent to $8,091 in 2012-’13. The increases were also 5.5 percent in each of the previous five years. Other four-year schools: The rates of increase were the same as at UW-Milwaukee. Tuition for 2012-’13 was $6,298. Two-year colleges: After the four-year freeze, tuition rose 5.5 percent in each of the next two years, and was $4,750 in 2012-’13. Our rating Walker said: "After years of 5.5 percent average tuition increases, we now have a two-year tuition freeze for the first time in the history of the UW System." Tuition increases were 5.5 percent or more for at least the two years before the current two-year freeze, depending on whether you’re considering tuition at the four-year universities or the two-year colleges. The current freeze is the first two-year freeze system-wide, but not the first for the system’s two-year colleges. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-02814	On whether people can keep their insurance under the Affordable Care Act.	half flip	/oregon/statements/2013/nov/26/kurt-schrader/did-rep-kurt-schrader-flip-flop-whether-folks-coul/	The latest controversy to wash over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act revolves around President Barack Obama’s much-repeated promise that folks who liked their insurance could keep it. As it turns out, hundreds of thousands of people -- more than 140,000 in Oregon alone -- are receiving cancellation notices from their insurers. Folks are being forced into new plans that better meet the requirements established by the law. Now, it’s no surprise that Republicans have seized on this -- but they’re not alone. Some Democrats, including Oregon’s Rep. Kurt Schrader, have also taken to criticizing the president’s simplistic language on the subject. During a TV appearance in early November, Schrader called the president’s words "grossly misleading." The fuller comment: "I think the president was grossly misleading to the American public. I knew right away as a veterinarian -- I had my own business -- that my policies got canceled even before the ACA. I know that I would change policies on a regular basis. … "Not being honest that a lot of these policies were going to get canceled was grossly misleading." When the interviewer pointed out that Schrader’s own website had a similar pledge, he asserted that he’d offered folks more context in person while selling the law’s other benefits. This, of course, opened him up to an attack from the National Republican Congressional Committee. An NRCC spokeswoman released a comment alleging that "after being a loyal ObamaCare foot soldier for years, Kurt Schrader is blatantly misleading voters in the face of changing political winds and the law’s botched rollout. Maybe next time Schrader will read his own website before such an obvious attempt to deceive voters." All of this left our heads spinning. We wondered if Schrader really had flip-flopped on the issue of whether the ACA allowed folks to keep their insurance. We called Schrader to see if he could explain why the content on his website was any different than what the president had been saying. His defense, essentially, came down to frequency. For the president, it was a common claim. Schrader, however, maintained that he emphasized other parts of the reform -- affordability and access, for example -- and was honest about the possibility of folks losing their current plan. As proof, he sent us the full transcript of what his website had said on the issue along with a summary of the law his office had issued after its passage. We’ll walk you through the most relevant parts. First, the Q&A on his website included this bit: "I’m insured – what happens to me? If you are insured and are happy with your current coverage, nothing changes." It explores that issue again in the next question: "Will I be forced to give up my current coverage and use coverage that is forced on me? No, but if your insurer changes your plan, the new plan must conform with ACA requirements like Basic Benefits Coverage while prohibiting the following: denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions, limits on annual and lifetime coverage, co-pays for preventive care, etc." Taken together, especially for somebody who doesn’t understand the law well, the answers hammer home the point that nobody will be forced to change their plan -- even if their insurance company might choose to do so. The NRCC also cited a summary of the health care law that Schrader released after the law passed. The summary said: "If individuals like their current plan, they may keep that plan for as long as they would like under the final proposal. These grandfathered plans will have most of the same consumer protections added as in the newer qualified plans." Again, that’s all accurate information. The only problem is that to have a grandfathered plan, you had to have been enrolled in it before the reforms became law back in March 2010. Now, that does give Schrader some cover. When his summary came out, many readers probably had insurance predating the law -- meaning their coverage would have been grandfathered. That’s different from when President Obama made the familiar pledge after, say, the Supreme Court upheld the law in June 2012. By then, folks might have changed plans -- when they changed jobs, for example -- without knowing that meant their health plan would no longer be grandfathered in. Schrader’s spokesman, Cody Tucker, argued in an email that the promise was essentially truer in the early days than it is now -- even though the law itself has not changed. "The difference is that though that was your understanding from the beginning, because you are engaged, the truth is most Americans and Oregonians did not understand the caveat of ‘unless it changed.’ "Therefore, to keep reiterating to the public that they can keep their health insurance plan is misleading, albeit accurate." (Accurate in that some folks are still covered by the grandfather provision.) To be sure, a look around the Internet did not reveal any high-profile examples of Schrader making this promise several times -- though neither did it reveal examples of him explaining the complicated nuances around this promise. What matters is Schrader is clearly on the record suggesting people could keep their plans if they wanted to. The qualifiers mentioned in the documents on his website would be unlikely to disabuse a casual reader of this notion. To now call that statement -- when the president says it -- "grossly misleading" is clearly a partial change in position. We rate this a Half-Flip.

pomt-14301	The 2016 federal omnibus spending bill "funds illegal immigrants coming in and through your border, right through Phoenix."	pants on fire!	/arizona/statements/2016/apr/01/donald-trump/does-federal-government-fund-undocumented-immigran/	Donald Trump bemoaned the $19 trillion national debt before launching into an attack on an expansive federal budget bill during a rally in Fountain Hills, Ariz. Referring to a spending bill known as the "omnibus," Trump said March 19. "It funds Obamacare, it funds Syrians coming into the United States, we have no idea who they are, it funds illegal immigrants coming in and through your border, right through Phoenix." President Barack Obama signed the omnibus, a $1.1 trillion federal spending bill, in December. The catch-all bill funds the federal government through Sept. 30, 2016. The type of expenditures vary quite a bit, covering benefit extensions for 9/11 first-responders and an increase in research dollars for the National Institutes of Health. The bill lumps together multiple spending bills. At PolitiFact Arizona, we were most interested in Trump’s claim that the omnibus "funds illegal immigrants coming in and through your border, right through Phoenix." The Trump campaign didn’t respond to our request for comment. Maybe because that’s because Trump is wrong. The omnibus bill does not fund undocumented immigrants "coming in and through" the border. In fact, it funds the very agency tasked with keeping undocumented immigrants out, U.S. Customs and Border Protection. "The salary of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is contained in that bill," said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. "If they weren’t funded, they’d have to stop patrolling." What Trump could have meant -- though it’s not what he said -- is that undocumented immigrants in the United States may be benefitting from subsidies such as food stamps through their children. But again, that’s not what he said. "There’s not ...a budget item for illegal immigration," said Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Obamacare, Syrians entering the U.S. This fact-check focuses on Trump's claim about undocumented immigrants. But since he also mentioned Obamacare and funding "Syrians coming into the United States," we thought it might be useful to address those claims as well. Most of the spending associated with President Barack Obama’s signature health care is mandatory spending and not part of the omnibus. But the omnibus did include relatively small amounts of discretionary spending, which includes services such as community health clinics. The bill also funded the Health and Human Services Department, which received $75.2 billion. De Rugy said the bill pays for "only a little" of the Affordable Care Act, namely administrative costs. The omnibus provides humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees in Jordan. The bill also funds refugees, in general, settling in the United States. It does not specifically fund Syrian refugees. "Those restrictions were left out of the omnibus. You’re funding the normal immigration process," said Josh Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition, which advocates for eliminating budget deficits. Dartmouth College government professor Joseph Bafumi noted that these refugees "could be Syrian." According to the U.S. State Department, 1,682 Syrians entered the United States as of Dec. 31, 2015. Still, that’s less than 3 percent of the 69,933 total refugees admitted to the United States for fiscal year 2015. Our ruling Trump criticized the "omnibus" spending bill passed by Congress and signed by Obama in December, saying it "funds illegal immigrants coming in and through your border, right through Phoenix," among other things. That’s wrong. It actually funds the agency trying to keep people from crossing the border illegally. Trump’s claim is wildly wrong. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-02702	"(The farm bill) has a provision that would in many ways reduce the deficit."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/02/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-says-farm-bill-would-reduce-deficit/	Political pundits had plenty of controversies to dish about during the final Sunday news shows of 2013. Over on CNN, talk turned to what State of the Union host Candy Crowley called the year’s "unmoments," or initiatives left on the table because of congressional gridlock. Democratic pundit and roundtable guest Donna Brazile lamented how energy, immigration and agriculture policy reforms languished. "For all these reasons, I mean, we couldn't get a farm bill out," Brazile said. "Although it has a provision that would in many ways reduce the deficit. It would help farmers right away. Help the agriculture. Help people on food stamps. We didn't get the farm bill." With omnipresent concern for the country’s financial constraints, we wanted to know: Would the 2013 versions of the farm bill (there were several floating around) reduce the deficit? Don’t let the name of the bill fool you: The legislation touches many corners of American agricultural policy, providing billions of dollars to some farmers in crop subsidies, not to mention its giant role in the country’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (better known as food stamps). Changes to the farm bill are renewed every five years, and it last passed in 2008 though some parts have been extended or reauthorized in the years since. Advocates, such as the American Farm Bureau Federation, are hopeful it will pass in January. One consequence of inaction (which means reverting to rules set in 1949) is the price of milk could increase, farm advocates warn. The package proposed in 2013 comes with a big price tag, no matter whose bill you examine. The Senate passed a version in June that would spend $955 billion from 2014-23. The House passed its farm bill in two different pieces of legislation totaling $921 billion over a decade. There are vast differences among the bills, particularly with SNAP policy, but they do have one thing in common: Each would reduce the deficit, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It’s the job of CBO to estimate the cost of legislation so policymakers know the implications of their votes. For bills like the farm bill, CBO analysts use accepted economic forecasting methods to essentially make their best guess about how programs will affect the budget under existing law. The office projected the costs of each chamber’s farm bills since spring 2013, with new estimates coming later to account for amendments and other money-related changes tacked on during the lawmaking process. To give a big picture, the analysts make some assumptions about future policy. Their estimates for the farm bills, for example, assume that programs set to expire would be reauthorized without major changes in 2018 through 2023. Let’s start with CBO’s "baseline." The office assumed that if the programs in the farm bill continued in their current form over the next decade, it would cost $973 billion. In its May analysis, CBO found the Senate bill would reduce that total by $17.9 billion through 2023. In other words, it would have net-deficit reduction of almost $18 billion. The pair of House bills would go further, CBO found, reducing the deficit by a total of $51.9 billion. The House would cut about 10 times more in the food stamps program than the Senate ($4 billion versus $40 billion). We’re still waiting on final cost estimates from CBO because we’re still waiting on a final conference bill agreed to by representatives of both parties. Both bills rack up savings by cutting back on crop subsidy and conservation programs, including eliminating direct payments to farmers regardless of whether they are currently farming their land. That program costs about $5 billion a year and was conceived in 1996 as a temporary solution. The bill would spend some of the savings achieved from cutting those payments by investing into its crop insurance program and allowing more farmers to get subsidies. As evidence for her claim, Brazile sent us her email correspondence with a Senate aide, who said the details are not firm, but the final version of the bill negotiated by representatives of the House and Senate will include about $20 billion in spending cuts from 2014-23. CBO projections for that bill are not yet available. Critics of the farm bill, like Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, find it silly when people brag about "paltry" cost savings that comes with legislation authorizing mammoth spending. The bill would save even more if it had just eliminated direct payments without expanding farm entitlement programs, Ellis said, such as one that would guarantee farmers 90 percent of their revenue in the event of a disaster. "Technically, they’re right, there is the CBO score," Ellis said. "It’s only in Washington where you can talk about spending $1 trillion and talk about how it’s saving you money." Ellis pointed out that most of the savings anticipated by CBO come in 2018-23, which is after the farm bill being worked on now would expire. So about 70 percent of the anticipated savings in the Senate version, for instance, are based on the assumption that policy changes would continue in a future farm bill. His group has criticized CBO’s estimates for the costs of recent farm bills as much too rosy, with the final 10-year cost of recent farm bills coming in billions more than CBO projected. CBO addressed discrepancies like it in a Q&A.The office builds forecasts on current law, but lawmakers often change laws in ways that could significantly drive up the actual cost of legislation from what was projected, CBO says. Other times, legislation changes after CBO produced its projection. "The differences between outcomes and projections can be misleading measures of the quality of the projections unless adjustments are made for changes in laws," the CBO said. Ferd Hoefner, National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition policy director, said it’s very hard to pin down the exact effect of the farm bill on the deficit because it depends in large part on the future prices of commodities. "How can you guess what the price is going to be in 2020?" he said. "Will (the cuts) be as great as what the Congressional Budget Office predicts? Perhaps, but it’s hard to tell." Our ruling Brazile said the farm bill "has a provision that would in many ways reduce the deficit." Her comment is based on estimates of the House and Senate bills by the Congressional Budget Office, which found both bills to be deficit-reducers in the long term. Over 10 years, the proposal would shrink the deficit by around $20 billion or so -- a paltry sum in the universe of federal spending. But yes, technically a deficit reducer. Brazile is right but her comments might lead someone to more sweeping conclusions. As such, we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Donna Brazile	None	None	None	2014-01-02T12:00:40	2013-12-29	['None']
pomt-11782	"Southwest Airlines celebrating 50th anniversary by providing 2 free tickets to everyone!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/27/soutwest-aircom/offer-free-tickets-southwest-airlines-scam/	Southwest Airlines is known for its cheap deals -- but a deal to fly for free? "Southwest Airlines celebrating 50th anniversary by providing 2 free tickets to everyone!" states a headline circulating on Facebook on soutwest-air.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. A Southwest Airlines spokesman, Dan Landson, confirmed that it is a scam. The phony website promotes a deal that promises that viewers have been "selected to take part in our short survey to get 2 Free Southwest Airlines Tickets! We only have 332 Tickets remaining so hurry up!" Upon completion of the survey participants get a message: "Congratulations! You won 2 Free tickets at Southwest Airlines!" But don’t expect those tickets to ever arrive. "A good rule of thumb is that if something sounds too good to be true, it generally is," Landson told PolitiFact. Landson pointed to a few signs that this is fake news: the airline’s official website is Southwest.com while this website is sout-west.com. The date written as "27. November 2017" is also not a format that Southwest uses. "And, we never just give out free tickets," Landson said. Landson said Southwest is in its 47th year, not its 50th. (Landson originally said the airline had celebrated its 48th birthday, which is incorrect.) There’s been some type of scam like this floating around for several years. (We found an example of the scam reported in the Miami Herald in 2011). A similar previous version offered travelers free first-class tickets to a "dream destination" and $5,000. Graham Cluley, a security analyst, wrote about the repercussions of such a scam in 2016. "The end result of all these shenanigans, of course, is to trick Facebook users into poor decisions – whether it be taking online surveys which earn affiliate cash for the scammers, signing up for expensive premium rate mobile services, or spamming the unwary with unwanted (and sometimes malicious) messages. .... If you are ever in any doubt as to whether a special offer on Facebook is genuine or not, visit the company’s real website to see if they mention the competition there – or whether they are warning of a scam." Consumers can get actual information about Southwest at 1-800-I-FLY-SWA or Southwest.com. So the headline that states "Southwest Airlines celebrating 50th anniversary by providing 2 free tickets to everyone!" is a scam. Similar versions have circulated for years.

pomt-13851	Says Donald Trump "wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jul/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-wants-get-rid-federal/	In her speech in Charlotte on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton slammed Donald Trump’s economic platform. Specifically, Clinton said, the Republican presidential nominee doesn’t want the U.S. government to guarantee that workers get a minimum wage. "Donald Trump thinks wages are too high," Clinton said. "He actually stood on the debate stage and said that. And he wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage altogether. Well, I think anyone who is willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well enough to raise a family. So we’re going to increase the federal minimum wage and give the middle class a raise." The Charlotte crowd cheered loudly for Clinton’s promise of a higher minimum wage, and it might not have just been because they were supporters. A report released earlier this year by North Carolina non-profit MDC, which is focused on poverty and social justice issues, said that of the 100 largest metro areas in the country, Charlotte ranks 97th for upward mobility. It defined upward mobility as a child born into a low-income family eventually moving into the middle or upper class. In fact, the report said, four of the six worst metro areas in the country were in North Carolina – Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh and Fayetteville. Certainly a higher minimum wage would be popular to some, just as a lower minimum wage would be popular to others. We’re not here to debate what’s best, but rather to find out if Clinton’s description of Trump’s views are accurate. Trump’s stance As it turns out, Trump’s views on wages are all over the map. He did say at one Republican presidential debate that he thought wages are too high, but he has also later said that he doesn’t understand how people survive on the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. PolitiFact has previously noted his scattered opinions on wages, in an article devoted to tracking his evolving positions on a half dozen topics. So we’ll look instead at the second part of Clinton’s attack. Did Trump really say the he wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage? Like his other comments on wages in general, Trump’s stance on the federal minimum wage is a bit complicated to parse. In May, he appeared on NBC’s Meet The Press, when host Chuck Todd attempted to pin him down on this very subject. Trump began by expressing sympathy for people working for the minimum wage, saying "I have seen what's going on. And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour." He immediately pivoted, saying that while he would personally like to see a higher minimum wage, he also wouldn’t do anything if elected to make it reality. "I would like to see an increase of some magnitude," Trump told Todd. "But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other." Todd followed that up by asking if Trump thought the states should only be able to decide whether to raise their minimum wages from the $7.25 federally mandated minimum wage, or if there should be no federal minimum wage at all – giving states the option to go lower than $7.25 or have no minimum wage at all. "But should the federal government set a floor?" Todd asked. "No," Trump replied. "I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do." Since that was now nearly two months ago, and Trump has been known to change his opinion on wages in the past, we reached out to his campaign to ask if he still believed that the federal government should not require a minimum wage. We did not hear back. Trump has also said that the minimum wage should be left up to the states in at least four other TV and radio interviews. Our ruling Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump "wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage." She is right. While Trump has said he personally thinks the minimum wage should be higher, he has also said that it should be up to the states and that the federal government should not set a nation-wide minimum wage at all.

pomt-00225	Says Dave Brat "voted against protecting pre-existing conditions."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2018/oct/11/abigail-spanberger/spanberger-ad-exaggerates-brats-vote-pre-existing-/	U.S. Rep. Dave Brat has not protected health insurance rates for people with pre-existing conditions, according to Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic challenger in the 7th Congressional District. Spanberger makes the charge in a widely-played TV ad. It features Jody Cametas, a Goochland attorney, saying her son, Mason, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was 10. "He had to learn to test his blood sugar multiple times a day and give himself injections," Cametas says. "And it’s so expensive that many families are sharing supplies to make ends meet. "I feel betrayed by Dave Brat; he voted against protections for pre-existing conditions for families like mine," she says. The screen switches to video of Brat talking and white letters say, "Brat VOTED AGAINST PROTECTION for pre-existing conditions." Cametas finishes, "I voted for Dave Brat once. I will not make that mistake again. I’m voting for Abigail Spanberger." Brat campaign spokesperson Katie Price has labeled the claim about the congressman’s vote "a lie," and called on Spanberger to "correct the record immediately." Spanberger stands by the commercial. So we investigated whether Spanberger’s ad claim is accurate. The vote Spanberger defends her ad by citing Brat’s vote on May 4, 2017 for the American Health Care Act - a Republican bill that would have largely repealed the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The measure passed the House on a mostly partisan 217-213 vote, but died in the Senate. One of the most popular parts of Obamacare is a mandate that health insurers cannot reject people on the basis of pre-existing conditions - such as asthma, cancer, heart disease or diabetes - or charge them exorbitant premiums. The AHCA kept the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions be offered insurance. But it would have changed Obamacare’s rules limiting how much those people could be charged. The legislation would have allowed states to get waivers from individual requirements of Obamacare. Insurers in those states would have been permitted to raise the premiums, for one year, of people with pre-existing conditions who were uninsured for at least 63 straight days the previous year. The bill would have appropriated $8 billion over five years to help people who couldn’t afford their penalty premium. After a year of paying higher rates, penalized people would have again qualify for regular rates. In other words, the bill would have allowed, in some cases, insurers to consider pre-existing conditions in writing policies. But this would have been unusual. The impact The bill would have had little effect on 153 million Americans who get their health insurance through an employer - roughly half the population under 65. It was unknown how many states would apply for waivers. And only some of the people who buy their own insurance would have had a three-month gap in their coverage. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care, estimated that "6.3 million people "could potentially face higher premiums under the House’s American Health Care Act (AHCA), due to pre-existing health conditions." That’s a significant number, but a small portion of all the people under 65 with pre-existing conditions (those 65 or older are eligible for Medicare, which covers almost all previous health issues). The Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that between 50 million and 129 million Americans under 65 might have a pre-existing health condition. That suggests, when combined with the Kaiser’s research, that somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions might have faced higher premiums under the AHCA. Our ruling Spanberger’s ad says Brat "voted against protecting pre-existing conditions," and, in a limited way, he did when he supported the AHCA. The bill would have allowed states to request a waiver from a popular Obamacare provision barring insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. But the sweeping language in the ad makes it seem like the AHCA would affect any child or adult with a pre-existing condition, and that’s not so. In fact, a small portion of them would have been at risk. Kaiser estimates that about 6.3 million people faced potentially higher - much higher - premiums for one year. That’s somewhere 4 and 13 percent of the people under 65 with pre-existing conditions. So Spanburger’s claim is partially accurate, but omits important details and context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-07476	"The Republicans have demanded deep cuts in education. They've demanded cuts in cancer research and other research to find cures and treatments to diseases."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/15/chris-van-hollen/chris-van-hollen-says-gop-has-demanded-deep-cuts-e/	On the April 10, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., faced off against Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., over the federal budget. At one point, Van Hollen -- the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee -- criticized Republican spending proposals, saying that the party has targeted popular programs such as education and cancer research. At the time This Week aired, the details of the budget deal struck two days earlier were still emerging, so Van Hollen said he would "reserve judgment" on the language of the final spending bill. But he took a swipe at earlier, Republican-backed spending proposals. He said that "the unfortunate part about this entire situation is that Mike and his colleagues threatened to shut down the entire federal government, which would have huge economic dislocation and disruption in the country, in order to pass a bill that, at the end of the day, doesn't create one job. … The Republicans have demanded deep cuts in education. They've demanded cuts in cancer research and other research to find cures and treatments to diseases. And instead of focusing just on a narrow slice of cuts that they were demanding, we were able to expand the area of cuts and prevent some (in the budget deal). So that's good news." We wondered whether Van Hollen was right when he said that "the Republicans have demanded deep cuts in education. They've demanded cuts in cancer research and other research to find cures and treatments to diseases." Van Hollen's remarks were based on H.R. 1, a fiscal year 2011 spending bill that passed the House but was rejected by the Senate in a 44-56 vote on March 9, 2011. We’re using it because it was a virtually pure Republican proposal: Only three Republicans voted against it on the floor, and no Democrats voted for it. So, would these programs be cut under H.R. 1? The answer is yes. Here are some of the key areas: • Title I education spending. This is a program that sends federal funds to the states for K-12 education. H.R. 1 would have cut Title I spending by $693.5 million compared to the amount enacted for fiscal year 2010. • Part B IDEA grants. This program provides federal funding for special education based on a formula. H.R. 1 would have cut Part B spending by $557.7 million compared to the fiscal year 2010 level. • Pell grants. This program funds low-income individuals pursuing undergraduate or sometimes graduate degrees. H.R. 1 would have capped the size of Pell grants for the 2011-12 award year at $4,015. Once that amount is adjusted for an additional sum provided under mandatory funding, the maximum level for Pell grants would be $845 lower than today’s level. • Head Start. This program provides low-income children of preschool age with child-development programs that teach skills that prepare them for school. H.R. 1 would have cut Head Start, which is run by the Department of Health and Human Servcies, by a little under $1.1 billion. • National Institutes of Heath. NIH is the leading federal institution for conducting research on disease treatments. H.R. 1 would have cut its general budget back to 2008 levels, amounting to a reduction of $639.5 million from fiscal year 2010. In congressional testimony on March 11, 2011, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that the proposed cuts would mean that "about half of the hundred largest clinical studies including those on cancer and Alzheimer's would probably be canceled." When we spoke to Boehner’s office, they didn’t counter the notion that these areas would have been cut if H.R. 1 had been enacted. "In H.R. 1, we did cut IDEA, Head Start, Title I, Pell grants and NIH," said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner. "The cuts were across all accounts. Nothing was off limits." Of course, Republicans have emphasized broader aspects of their bill. In a Feb. 12, 2011, news release about the introduction of H.R. 1, Boehner spoke generally about cutting spending and reducing the size of government, and didn’t mention education and disease research. The statement issued the same day by Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., didn’t get specific, either. And in a Feb. 15, 2011, floor speech about the bill, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., didn’t mention those programs either. The specific programs he cited were elimination of previous earmark funding from fiscal 2010 and the rescinding of unobligated funding from the stimulus bill. None of this is remotely surprising -- in the abstract, education and disease research tend to be popular programs. One would expect Republican leaders to play up the more popular aspects of the bill, such as taming the deficit and reducing the size of government, rather than the less popular ones. By the same token, it's not surprising that Van Hollen highlighted the budget’s impact on education and disease research. It’s the latest incarnation of the old political war-cry that your opponent is targeting widows, orphans and other helpless Americans. But that’s not the whole story. H.R. 1 aimed to cut discretionary spending by $100 billion -- including loads of cuts that had nothing to do with education or disease research. We do think Van Hollen’s underlying point -- that cuts were made to education and disease research -- is valid. Reasonable people can disagree on whether such cuts are justified, but Van Hollen is well within his rights to point out that these programs would be cut under H.R. 1, just as Republicans are well within their rights to argue that the deficit is so large that every federal program needs to give up some funding. Ultimately, the voters will decide whose priorities hold sway. In our view, Van Hollen has narrowed the Republicans’ bill, which includes wide-ranging cuts, to just two popular programs. On the other hand, he’s right that those programs would take budget hits under the bill. On balance, we rate his comment Mostly True.

pomt-04021	Says "on the state level, we spend less today than Jon Corzine spent in fiscal year 2008, five years later."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/03/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-state-spending-lower-today-u/	The only way to make New Jersey a more affordable place to live is to have government spend less money, according to Gov. Chris Christie. The Republican governor offered that solution when a man called into a Jan. 22 radio program and expressed concerns about the cost of living in New Jersey. The caller wanted to know the plan for keeping people like him in the state. Christie told the man that property taxes have increased minimally in the last two years, because government spending has been capped. On the state level, spending is now lower than it was under Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine in fiscal year 2008, according to Christie. "Now we’re making a difference. Because you know why? We’re capping spending," Christie said on New Jersey 101.5’s "Ask the Governor" program. "We’re saying you’ve got to spend less, and on the state level, we spend less today than Jon Corzine spent in fiscal year 2008, five years later." The governor, who is seeking re-election this year, repeated the state spending claim on Thursday during a campaign stop at Tops Diner in East Newark. Christie is right that state spending in the current fiscal year is lower than the spending level in fiscal year 2008, but the governor’s claim ignores the fact that spending has still increased with each new state budget since he took office. Let’s break down the numbers: For fiscal year 2008, Corzine approved a spending plan of about $33.47 billion, according to state Department of the Treasury reports. Final state spending that year ended slightly higher, at $33.61 billion, according to department reports. In June 2012, Christie signed a budget for fiscal year 2013 that appropriates about $31.65 billion in state spending. So, the governor’s current budget marks a nearly $2 billion decrease in state spending as compared to fiscal year 2008. But just because state spending is lower than it was five years ago, doesn’t mean it hasn’t increased on Christie’s watch. In his first budget after taking office in January 2010, Christie approved a roughly $28.36 billion spending plan for fiscal year 2011. For the next budget year -- fiscal year 2012 -- the governor approved a roughly $29.69 billion budget. That means, in terms of the annual appropriations acts signed by Christie, state spending has increased by about $3.29 billion, or 11.6 percent, between fiscal years 2011 and 2013. In response to our findings about spending increases during Christie's tenure, Treasury spokesman Bill Quinn said the following in an e-mail: "We think your original question has been conclusively answered in the Governor’s favor as unequivocally true. You are now posing an entirely different inquiry that is not based on what the Governor actually said on the air that led to your fact check." The increased spending since fiscal year 2011 is due in part to the governor’s policies boosting the state’s economy, leading to higher tax revenues, according to Quinn. He pointed out how two of the major areas of higher spending have been in education and pension contributions. Quinn added that "the tough decisions needed to put the state budget on sound, responsible fiscal footing in fiscal years 10 and 11 allowed us to grow and make key investments in FY 12 and 13." Our ruling In response to a caller during New Jersey 101.5’s "Ask the Governor" program, Christie claimed that "on the state level, we spend less today than Jon Corzine spent in fiscal year 2008, five years later." The governor is correct in that the fiscal year 2013 budget is nearly $2 billion less than the level of state spending under Corzine in fiscal year 2008. But Christie’s claim ignores the fact that state spending has still increased during his tenure. That means the governor’s statement "is accurate but needs clarification or additional information." That meets our definition of Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2013-02-03T07:30:00	2013-01-22	['Jon_Corzine']
pomt-00377	Current school lunch requirements "cause large amounts of food waste and diminished use of school lunches!"	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/sep/08/vicky-hartzler/hartzler-wrong-attack-healthy-school-lunches/	It’s no secret that Americans throw out literal tons of food each year, but has an Obama-era federal school lunch policy made it worse? Fourth District U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., seems to think so, and it motivated her to co-sponsor a new bill aimed at curbing some nutritional regulations that require schools to serve more healthy foods. In an Aug. 14 tweet, Hartzler announced the introduction of the Local Control of School Lunch Act (HR 6541) and promised her followers: "This bill would provide students & school lunch workers relief from rigid federal school lunch requirements that cause large amounts of food waste & diminished use of school lunches!" We’ve looked at other policymakers’ claims about the value of regulating nutritional standards. What caught our attention with Hartzler’s tweet was her assertion that kids are throwing more food away under these regulations. We wondered if that was really true. How to measure waste A quick note to Hartzler’s office confirmed that her bill is a reaction to Congress passing the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Acts of 2010, a policy initiative supported by then-first lady Michelle Obama, who championed the cause of reducing childhood obesity. It mandates that schools must serve more fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and limits calorie and sodium intake, among other things. Since the law went into effect during the 2012-13 school year, critics such as Hartzler have argued that it amplifies food waste because kids don’t find the new menu options appetizing. Citing those and other reasons, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in 2017 relaxed some of the original rules. When we asked for the proof supporting her claim, Hartzler’s office sent us a link to a 2014 study commissioned by the Department of Agriculture. Her office specifically cited a chart in the report which states that the waste of both raw and cooked vegetables in school cafeterias saw an increase of more than 60 percent. But then we noticed a footnote underneath the chart Hartzler’s office used to defend the food waste statement: "Plate waste estimates were based on observations and not actually measured or calculated during SY 2013–14." 2M Research Services, LLC, the group that wrote the report, did not respond to repeated calls and emails from PolitiFact. So we reached out to five independent food policy experts. The three who responded had similar reactions: Accurately measuring food waste is more complicated than the general public might understand. "There are several ways to measure food waste using validated tools that yield quantifiable data," said Carmen Byker Shanks, an associate professor of food, nutrition and sustainable food systems at Montana State University. She said observation — the method used in the study cited by Hartzler — is an important first step, but that it’s "subject to many biases." In 2017, Byker Shanks led a study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, which found that since the 1970s, around 30 percent of school lunches have consistently landed in the trash. "Kids just don’t eat all of their food," said Marlene Schwartz, director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut and professor of human development and family studies, in an email. Schwartz said waste should be calculated based on the proportion of food that is eaten, not the total amount thrown away. She used that framework to co-write a 2015 study that concluded overall plate waste has decreased under the new guidelines. There were more fruits and vegetables served since the 2010 regulations, Schwartz said, because it was a requirement with every meal. "But the proportion of fruit eaten before (in our study) was on average 70 percent and the proportion thrown out was on average 30 percent, and afterwards, the proportions stayed the same: 70 percent eaten and 30 percent thrown out," Schwartz said. In fact, a 2014 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, which measured the physical weight of wasted lunches, said that after the implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, entree and vegetable consumption increased by 15.6 and 16.2 percent, respectively. No change in school lunch participation trends As for Hartzler’s other claim that student participation in school lunch programs has diminished under the push for healthier food, Schwartz said there is no evidence to support that. In fact, the same report Hartzler pointed to as evidence for increased plate waste, said that while some school administrators observed challenges during the first year, there has been no substantial change in school lunch program participation between 2011 and 2014. Moreover, a 2015 study by the Food Research and Action Center, a national nonprofit geared toward reducing hunger, reported no noticeable change in participation trends over the past five years, compared to before the legislation was implemented. Participation continues to rise among low-income children and it continues to decline among children not eligible for free or reduced-price meals, the report said. Our ruling In announcing a bill that would roll back Obama-era legislation making school lunch regulations healthier, Hartzler tweeted federal school lunch requirements "cause large amounts of food waste & diminished use of school lunches!" Experts say the observation-based evidence she uses to back up the claim is faulty and that the proportion of healthy foods thrown out is about the same, even though the total amount of fruits and vegetables wasted has gone up because they are required on every child’s plate. They also say that no substantial drop off in school lunch program participation has occurred since the law went into effect. For those reasons, we rate this claim as Mostly False.

pomt-12693	"One-third of the counties — think of it, one-third — only have one insurer left" on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-one-third-counties-have-only-one-insu/	Insurance providers are "fleeing" Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges, President Donald Trump said at a March 13 "listening session" on health care. "One-third of the counties — think of it, one-third — only have one insurer left," Trump said, adding that the Republican replacement for the 2010 health care law known as Obamacare will have "far more choices, at a lower cost." Trump has the right statistic about insurance provider participation. In 32 percent of counties, individuals looking to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act online marketplace have just one choice for their insurance provider, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, last updated in November 2016. In several states, including Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming, there’s only one insurance provider total participating in each state’s online marketplace in 2017. That’s a significant change from 2016, when just 7 percent of counties — and one state, Wyoming — were limited to one insurance provider on the online exchanges. On the other end of the spectrum, Wisconsin has 15 insurance providers participating in the exchanges in 2017, and Ohio has 11. It’s important to note that Trump’s claim doesn’t mean one-third of people have only one provider to choose from for health insurance. Because rural and sparsely populated areas tend to have lower competition, about 21 percent, or one-fifth, of exchange enrollees live in these counties where there’s only one insurance provider to choose from, according to Kaiser. So of the approximately 9.2 million people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act exchanges in 2017, about 1.9 million could only purchase insurance from one company. These individuals could still buy insurance outside the marketplace and from another provider. But if they did so, they wouldn’t be able to get a federal subsidy to defray the cost. Insurance companies that have dropped from the exchanges — including UnitedHealthGroup, Humana and Aetna — have said they were losing money by participating. Among plans offered on the exchanges, costs have gone way up. Looking at a standard measurement used by the Department of Health and Human Services — what a family of four with a household income of $60,000 would pay for premiums on the second-lowest-cost silver plan — average premiums for this type of plan rose by 38 percent between 2014 and 2017. "Of course, everyone would like to see more competition in the marketplaces — that's important for keeping costs down," said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. "But there has always been a recognition that there would be more competition in some places than others." Glied added that individual insurance markets in many states were highly concentrated before the Affordable Care Act, too. Our ruling Trump said, "One-third of the counties — think of it, one-third — only have one insurer left." As long as you know that Trump is specifically talking about Affordable Care Act exchanges, Trump’s figure checks out. People trying to purchase insurance on a government exchange only have one provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation’s counties, according to late 2016 data from Kaiser. That means 21 percent of Affordable Care Act enrollees, or about 1.9 million people in 2017, can only pick from one health insurance provider. We rate Trump’s claim True.

pomt-03614	Says Texas leads the nation in fatal industrial accidents.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/may/08/jim-marston/jim-marston-says-texas-leads-nation-fatal-industri/	Five days after the fertilizer plant explosion that killed 14 in West, talk turned to safety regulation at the Texas Tribune’s morning interview series. Jim Marston, founding director of the Texas office of the Environmental Defense Fund, opined from the Tribune stage on April 22, 2013, that state regulation should have prevented the deaths. In Texas, "we lead the nation in fatal industrial accidents," he said. To support his statement, he referred us to Elena Craft, a toxicologist with the fund, who told us by phone that the information came from a Sept. 20, 2012, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report. That report, though, was on 2011 fatal occupational injuries -- including intentional acts such as murder and suicides and spanning, bureau economist Steve Pegula told us by phone, "every occupation in the U.S." Pegula told us the bureau does not use the term "industrial accidents" and has no definition for it. Others we talked with for this story used phrases such as "an accident that arises out of the course of employment" or "workplace event that results in multiple fatalities." "Industrial," we found, could be defined as narrowly as manufacturing or as broadly as any business at all. The bureau tally, Pegula said, includes deadly events or exposure on or off an employer’s premises during or related to the employee’s job or work status. For example, the deaths of farmers, police or nurses are included if they take place on the job or related to their work. Not included are illnesses or events such as heart attacks or strokes, because onsets can be delayed and it can be hard to prove the connection to employment, Pegula said. Via email, Marston told us that although his claim had been based on the total deaths in the bureau’s count, "I do agree with you that not all fatal occupation injuries listed in the BLS data can be attributed to poor environmental compliance." Texas, he said, had the most deaths tabulated by the bureau in four areas he described as "fatal industrial accident categories": fires and explosions; falls, trips and slips; exposure to harmful substances or environments; and contact with objects and equipment. Representatives of groups we spoke with -- the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the National Safety Council and the Texas-based Workers Defense Project -- told us the bureau’s Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, which generated the figures Marston relied on, was the most comprehensive source of data on occupational injuries and deaths. Pegula said the Sept. 12, 2012, report gave preliminary 2011 data, "which is going to differ slightly" from the final numbers, "but it’s a good guiding post." Of the six types of event or exposure the bureau listed, Texas led in five -- the four Marston tabbed as "industrial accident categories" plus the transportation category. California led in deaths caused by violence and other injuries by persons or animals. The report showed Texas had 18 of the nation’s 143 work fatalities attributed to fires and explosions; 67 of the total 666 from falls, slips and trips; 43 of the 401 caused by exposure to harmful substances or environments; and 66 of 708 deaths resulting from contact with objects and other equipment. California had the second-most in each of Marston’s four categories: 9, 60, 36 and 50 deaths, respectively. Third in fires/explosions was Tennessee with 10; third in falls and slips was New York with 39; third in harmful exposure was Florida with 27; and New York was third in object/equipment contact deaths at 34. We looked at preliminary data for 2003 through 2010 and found Texas led those categories about 88 percent of the time. Texas’ totals are high, Pegula said, "because it’s a very large state." Texas, California, Florida and New York have some of the largest labor forces in the U.S. Seeking a way to account for that, we took each state’s 2011 raw numbers of deaths in the four categories Marston tabbed, added them together, then divided by the average number of workers employed in the state in 2011 per the federal bureau. Texas ranked 18th, with a rate of 1.7 such deaths per 100,000 workers. Observing that the five states with the "worst" rates all employed fewer than 1 million people in 2011, we checked to see how Texas fared among states employing more than 1 million. The answer: 10th place. "Worst" among all 50 states were Montana (3.4 deaths per 100,000 workers), North Dakota (3.3), West Virginia (3), Alaska (3) and New Mexico (2.8). "Worst" among states with more than 1 million employed were Arkansas (2.6), Louisiana (2.3), Kansas (2.3), Missouri (2.1) and Kentucky (2). Pegula at the federal bureau cautioned against comparing states, especially with such small amounts of data as the fatalities in specific categories. Not only the number of workers but also the industries represented vary widely from state to state, he said. The big difference in population sizes, Marston said, causes variability in comparing the rates -- one reason he chose to use raw counts rather than per-capita rates. Marston said he stands behind his statement "as true and accurate using the best available data." Our ruling Marston said that in Texas, "we lead the nation in fatal industrial accidents." Among the states, Texas ranked No. 1 in 2011 in the number of workplace deaths in four federal categories Marston tabbed as "industrial accident" deaths. Yet these results drew on raw counts of deaths, unadjusted for variations in state workforces. Our adjustment for each state’s relative workforce suggests that Texas, per worker, ranked 18th among the states in 2011. We rate his statement as Half True.

pomt-14226	Austin’s Stop Abuse for Everyone has seen in its offices "sexual assault survivors that report being attacked by their ridesharing drivers, at a rate of one per month."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/apr/15/our-city-our-safety-our-choice/our-city-backers-give-incomplete-account-reported-/	A fund-raising letter from opponents of a May 2016 Austin ballot proposition affecting drivers for ride-hailing services made us wonder about assaults of residents who purchase a ride through Uber or Lyft. The April 8, 2016, letter, signed by more than 30 women including current and former Austin City Council members, solicits donations to Our City, Our Safety, Our Choice, which urges Austin residents to vote "no" on the proposition before voters May 7. At issue: Whether to replace a city ordinance requiring ride-hailing services to submit drivers to background checks including fingerprinting with a mandate preferred by the services which doesn’t require fingerprinting. The letter’s first section refers to a tally of Travis County sexual assaults in 2015 before noting that many assaults go unreported, a conclusion the letter attributes to a Jan. 28, 2016, press release from SAFE, which stands for Stop Abuse for Everyone; the alliance brings together the Austin Children’s Shelter and SafePlace, which says it provides safety for individuals and families affected by sexual and domestic violence. In a new paragraph, the letter says safety "must be a priority for our city, and that includes the safety of riders." Then the letter says: "In the words of one of SAFE Alliance’s forensic nurses ‘I have taken care of about a thousand people in the immediate aftermath of sexual assault . . . I am now seeing a pattern of rape reports that all involve ridesharing and it is of extreme concern to me.’ "SAFE describes ‘seeing too many sexual assault survivors that report being attacked by their ridesharing drivers, at a rate of one per month in our offices.’" One reported assault-by-driver a month? Group points to web post We asked the campaign coordinator for Our City, Our Safety, Our Choice about the basis of the quoted statement. By email, Mykle Tomlinson replied that the letter originated with supportive women, not the group. He also pointed us to the Jan. 28, 2016, web post by Kelly White, CEO of the SAFE Alliance. And at first, it looked to us like the anti-proposition group’s claim was fully backed by what White wrote. In fact, after White’s post declares the rate of "one per month," it says that’s an undercount, adding: "And that’s just the people we see, which is not nearly everyone. Some go to other organizations, some go to the police, and sadly many go nowhere at all." That well could be. At the least, a January 2016 Austin Police Department break-out of complaints about sex assaults connected to local ride-hailed vehicles or taxi rides supports speculation there may have been more than one alleged sex assault a month in 2015 connected to a ride-hailed driver. The department’s list, which we fielded for another fact check, indicates that from Jan. 15, 2015 through Jan. 1, 2016, police fielded 23 complaints concerning drivers for Uber, Lyft or, in two cases, "independent" ride-hailed vehicles. Entries on the list indicate possible crimes ranging from assault "sexual nature" to sexual assault to rape. We asked the Uber and Lyft companies for input about this claim. By email, Uber spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin said that of the SAFE-described assault allegations, "we have not been notified of any arrests or charges of this nature against a driver while using the Uber platform in Austin." We didn’t hear back from Lyft. Pattern in 2015 hasn’t extended into 2016 So, case closed on this "one per month" claim? Not quite, we found, because Austin’s SAFE reports no such reports from sex-assault victims in 2016. White, whom we reached by phone, said she wrote her January post to endorse an attempt by Austin Mayor Steve Adler to encourage, not require, individuals to provide their fingerprints before being permitted to work for Austin ride-hailing services. And, White told us, the "one per month" statement was rooted in the experiences of the alliance’s forensic nurses who, starting in June 2015, were newly available on the group’s campus to provide no-charge sexual assault forensic exams like those needed for evidence purposes; a clinic dedicated to providing the exams, Eloise House, opened on the campus in August 2015. By phone, alliance spokeswoman Victoria Berryhill said the alliance had become the sole Austin-area provider of the exams previously performed by another group in hospitals. Through 2015, White said, six women each told a nurse she’d been taken home and assaulted by a driver for the Uber or Lyft service. "The pattern was of young women alone late at night" or in "early morning hours, getting under the influence, getting into a vehicle with a stranger," White said, "and then they were getting taken back to their homes and they were getting assaulted in their own homes." However, in the first few months of 2016, Austin’s SAFE nurses fielded no such driver-assault reports. That is, she said, "we are not seeing" the pattern "any more." Our ruling Supporters of the anti-proposition group wrote that Austin’s SAFE has seen in its offices "sexual assault survivors that report being attacked by their ridesharing drivers, at a rate of one per month." According to SAFE’s CEO, that count reflected what forensic nurses heard from victims over the last half of 2015. Separately, an Austin police tally of assault complaints tied to ride-hailed drivers might signal an even greater per-month average for that year. However, we learned, SAFE heard no such reports from sexual assault victims through the first three-plus months of 2016, perhaps a welcome indication that the pattern reported for 2015 hasn't persisted.

pomt-13163	Says Austin Mayor Steve Adler’s transportation plans linked to Proposition 1 on the ballot remove "27+ miles of traffic lanes around the city," replacing "them with lanes dedicated to usage by bicycles" and buses.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/oct/28/sensible-transportation-solutions-austin-pac/pac-austin-plans-cut-27-plus-car-travel-lanes-make/	Advocates of a $720 million transportation bond proposal on Austin’s November 2016 ballot say the proposed spending will ultimately relieve traffic congestion all over. Yet a group opposing Proposition 1 warned that the plans touted by Austin Mayor Steve Adler entail handing over 27 miles of existing car lanes to buses and bicycles. An ad from the Sensible Transportation Solutions for Austin PAC in the Oct. 23, 2016 Austin American-Statesman had this statement: "The mayor has promised that passage of this proposition will ensure a decrease in traffic congestion. How will the mayor’s removing 27+ miles of traffic lanes around the city and replacing them with lanes dedicated to usage by bicycles and lots of increasingly empty buses help ease congestion?" We wondered if all those lane removals are penciled in to make way for buses and bikes. Travel lanes on stretches of major roads would be wiped out, we found, though more than half the reductions would make way for raised medians and turn bays—not buses—and, with the exception of part of Guadalupe at 24th Street, no lane removals are planned just to carve space for bikes. Also, the group didn't take into account car lanes that would be added with bond funding. Group cites citizen’s research By phone, Michael Levy, the PAC’s treasurer, told us he drew the count of 27-plus lost miles of traffic lanes from research by Roger Falk of the Travis County Taxpayers Association that focused on major city byways that would be affected by $482 million in the bond intended to reconfigure parts of nine "smart corridors." The smart corridors: North Lamar Boulevard from U.S. 183 to Howard Lane; South Lamar from Riverside Drive to Ben White Boulevard; Burnet Road from Koenig Lane to MoPac Boulevard; Airport Boulevard from U.S. 183 to North Lamar; East Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from U.S. 183 to Decker Lane; East Riverside from Interstate 35 to Texas 71; Guadalupe Street from MLK to West 29th; and unspecified sections of William Cannon Drive and Slaughter Lane. A note: Not all the identified changes would happen right off. According to an Oct. 23, 2016, Statesman Q&A, city studies aren’t even complete for two of the corridors and the $482 million would cover only a quarter to a third of the corridor projects’ total estimated $1.56 billion-plus price tag. Another aspect: At least 14 travel lane miles would be funded by $101 million of the proposed bond spending limited to local street improvements, according to an Oct. 1, 2016, Statesman news story. Projects in this category, the story said, include three miles on Parmer Lane and congested roads in west and northwest Austin. PAC’s backup To our inquiry, Falk emailed a document showing what he said he calculated based on city-posted smart corridor studies. All told, Falk’s document indicates that one to two lanes on portions of seven major roads would no longer be available to car traffic, for a total 32.1 "vehicle lane miles removed." Some 4.4 lane miles would be "returned" in spots, the document says, leaving a net loss of 27.7 lane miles. The document doesn’t talk about removed lanes becoming bus or bike lanes nor does it take note of the car travel lanes that would be added outside the smart corridors, which wasn't considered in the PAC's count of lost lanes, Levy acknowledged by phone. City and newspaper analyses After we shared Falk’s document with city officials, mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford said by phone the city’s corridor plans actually show only 4.4 lane-miles of traffic lanes that would definitely give way to bus lanes--specifically, a lane in each direction on a 1.2-mile stretch of Guadalupe near the University of Texas and a lane in each direction on a one-mile portion of East Riverside Drive. Meantime, Jim Wick of Move Austin Forward, a pro-proposition group, called to say Stanford had told him about our inquiry into the lanes-lost claim. By email, Wick said that by his calculation, city plans to replace two-way center turn (or chicken) lanes along parts of multiple corridors would lead to 14.8 lane miles getting replaced with raised medians. Wick said that another nine miles of the two-way center turn lanes on corridors have either already been taken up by medians or stand to be converted, under city plans, to left-turn "turning bays." Stanford and Wick each said city plans don’t call for any traffic lanes to be replaced by bikeways. Separately, Falk said by email he wasn’t aware of any lane removals specifically planned to make space for bike paths. On the other hand, the Oct. 1, 2016, Statesman story mentioned travel lanes potentially becoming bikeways under the city plans, the rationale being that bond-connected losses of travel lanes in each direction on a stretch of East Riverside Drive would partly be explained by the corridor plan’s call for new bike lanes on top of new parking, wider sidewalks and bus-only lanes on the street. Also, some new bus lanes would be open to bikes too. The story mentioned the addition of 14 miles of travel lanes that would be funded outside of smart corridors and said that roughly 15 lane-miles would be lost to through traffic in other spots, most of that to make way for buses. Under city plans, the story specified: --Three miles of East Riverside Drive would see one travel lane in each direction replaced by a bus-only lane while a 3.3-mile portion of South Lamar would see one lane become bus-only during rush hours and a lane in each direction on a one-mile part of Guadalupe would be replaced by bus-only lanes--which adds up to 14.6 lane miles. --Some 20 center or chicken lane miles would be replaced by medians: 3.3 miles on South Lamar, 5 miles on North Lamar, 6.5 miles on Airport and 5 miles on Burnet. By the newspaper’s analysis, then, it looks like city plans call for up to 35 lane miles to be removed with more than half the removals (20 lane miles) making way for medians and the rest yielding space for buses only--including part of South Lamar having dedicated bus lanes during rush hours. Stanford told us the newspaper's future bus-lane count ran high in that the rush-hour bus lanes on part of South Lamar are only to take effect "when supported by ridership," as the South Lamar corridor plan states. Too, Stanford said, the story overcounted total traffic lane removals because the city intends to skip recommended short-term improvements on North Lamar between Parmer Lane and Howard Lane (about a one-mile stretch, we calculated using Google maps) that would eliminate a travel lane in each direction by putting in a center-turn lane. Instead, Stanford said, the city plans to leap to long-term improvements leaving in place two travel lanes in each direction and adding a raised median and separate bike tracks, per the North Lamar/Burnet corridor plan. University of Texas expert For another perspective, we asked Chandra Bhat, director of the University of Texas Center for Transportation Research, to assess the lanes-lost claim. Bhat told us that he reviewed some of the city corridor plans before concluding that the expected removal of center/chicken lanes will make way for medians and turning bays--not lanes for buses or bikes. Otherwise, Bhat said, there are stretches such as part of Guadalupe for which the corridor plan indicates auto travel lanes becoming bus lanes. Bhat estimated such conversions could remove up to three-to-eight existing travel lane-miles in total, depending on engineering decisions. Asked to assess the PAC’s full claim, Bhat said: "From all that I can see, I don’t see how they could come up with that magnitude of reduction in auto lane mileage." Levy: ‘Hyperbole?’ Levy in a follow-up interview stressed by phone that motorists stand to lose more than 27 miles of travel lanes, plus or minus a couple, even if they’re not mostly set to give way to buses or bikes. He said a future ad would specify the major streets likely to lose those lane miles. "Was there hyperbole in the bike and bus" lane mentions in the ad, Levy said. "I was writing real fast." Our ruling The PAC said transportation plans linked to Proposition 1 on Austin's ballot remove "27+ miles of traffic lanes around the city," replacing "them with lanes dedicated to usage by bicycles" and buses. About that many car travel lane miles stand to go away if the bond proposition passes. However, 20 removed lane miles would be converted from center-turn lanes to raised medians and turning bays—not bus lanes. Also unsaid: The bond proposal would support the addition of at least 14 lane miles open to car traffic outside the city's smart corridors. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-10906	On whether he would seek to undo the Foxconn deal.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/02/matt-flynn/has-gubernatorial-candidate-matt-flynn-been-consis/	Gov. Scott Walker’s massive deal with Taiwan-based Foxconn has created a political debate that is, well, spirited. Proponents tout the 13,000 jobs Foxconn has said the operation will create; opponents cite the $4 billion in taxpayer incentives and the potential negative impact of the $10 billion electronics factory on the environment. Foxconn has been a central point cited by the eight remaining Democrats vying in the Aug. 14, 2018 primary for the right to take on Walker in November. In some cases, their positions are hard to keep track of. That brings us to candidate Matt Flynn, a former state party chairman. In August 2017, as the deal awaited a final vote, Flynn wrote an opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that said: "In my view, the correct approach for Wisconsin is to remove Walker's desperation from the equation and focus in a professional way. Professional negotiators who have the good of the state in mind, rather than Walker's, should reopen the dialogue with Foxconn." A month later, during an Oct. 12, 2017, interview with WisconsinEye host Steve Walters, Flynn had this to say about the Foxconn deal: "I will live up to all contractual commitments. I’m not looking to somehow sabotage anything." Hmm … that seems to conflict with Flynn’s more recent pledge that he will go to court to stop the deal. So, we’re rolling out our Flip-O-Meter -- and with it, our regular reminder: The Flip-O-Meter rates a person’s consistency on an issue, not whether any change is good or bad policy or politics. Has Flynn been consistent on whether he would seek to undo the Foxconn deal? Let’s take a look. Flynn’s Foxconn positions Our starting point is that quote from Oct. 12, 2017: "I will live up to all contractual commitments. I’m not looking to somehow sabotage anything." After that, his position appeared to shift, or did it really? Here is a look at various statements Flynn has made since then about Foxconn: December 23, 2017: In an interview posted by the Capital Times, Flynn said if he is elected, he will stop the state's Foxconn deal "no matter what." April 6, 2018: In a visit to Eau Claire, Flynn declared: "That contract is one that I will end the minute I get into office through litigation." He criticized the size of the subsidy, made claims about the company’s track record in China, and slammed Walker and Republicans for "letting them take water out of Lake Michigan." June 18, 2018: In a news release, Flynn said "Walker got taken to the cleaners in the Foxconn deal," and then declared: "Here's how I'll stop it with immediate litigation." June 28, 2018: At a protest rally on the day of the Foxconn groundbreaking, Flynn said: "It's an illegal contract and illegal contracts are not enforceable in the state of Wisconsin." He also claimed the deal "over the course of 15 years will bring the state close to bankruptcy if we want to fund our public schools and University of Wisconsin. It's a very crooked deal." July 19, 2018: In a statement on the Forward with Flynn website, Flynn said "The Foxconn deal is the worst economic development plan in history. It is also unconstitutional. As governor, I will bring litigation to rescind the contract on Day One. Foxconn can come here, but they will have to follow our laws and they will not get our tax dollars." If anything, Flynn’s rhetoric has become sharper and clearer as the campaign has gone on. What does Flynn say? In a telephone interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Flynn said, "my position on Foxconn is, and always has been, that that contract must be terminated." He noted he has even run a TV ad stating he will "stop this contract." Flynn then sought to reconcile his past statements: "From my August Op-Ed piece to the present, I have made it clear that until we a get a court order terminating the contract, we will live up to our commitments and will not surreptitiously sabotage this contract. … I want to legally break the contract by filing a lawsuit in federal court. I do not want to sabotage the deal by failing to live up to our commitments." But that statement does not entirely add up. First, the August 2017 opinion piece in the Journal Sentinel does not mention a court order for terminating a contract or the state living up to its end of the bargain until it could be undone in the courts. In fact, the piece was written before the deal was approved by the Legislature. What’s more, the "no sabotage" statement came two months later, in the WisconsinEye interview. In that interview, Flynn said at least three times in response to questions that he would "live up to contractual commitments" and would not "breach a contract" with Foxconn. He also said "going forward the state should know that I won’t be entering into these kinds of deals" and of Foxconn said: "If they don’t abide by their commitments I’ll take action on that." Again, no mention was made of unilaterally undoing the Foxconn deal or the deal being illegal or unconstitutional on its face. The only reference that hinted at legal action suggested it might come if the company did not follow through on its commitments. Our rating While Flynn says otherwise, his public statements on the Foxconn deal have not been consistent. Before the deal was approved, he wanted to reopen it. Once it was approved, he indicated he would "live up to contractual commitments" and would not "breach a contract." More recently, he says the deal itself is "illegal" and "unconstitutional" and that he would stop the state's Foxconn deal "no matter what." We give Flynn a Full Flop.

pomt-15226	"The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over. John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/07/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-fourth-amendment-was-what-we-fought/	During the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky stood out a bit when he cited America’s second president. It came during a heated exchange with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about how much government intrusiveness was needed to keep Americans safe from terrorism. "I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans," said Paul, who has been a leading voice in his party for privacy from government intrusion. "The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over. John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights." Taken in its most literal interpretation, this claim doesn’t make much sense, since the Fourth Amendment was ratified in 1791, about a decade and a half after the American Revolution began. But it’s pretty clear that Paul means that the issues embedded in the Fourth Amendment were a factor in the revolution, so that’s what we’re checking. Did Adams say the Fourth Amendment was "the spark that led to our war for independence?" For those who have forgotten what they learned in high-school civics class, the Fourth Amendment reads as follows: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." From looking at the documents and checking with experts, it appears that Paul is basically correct in saying that Adams felt this way, though the second president never actually used the word "spark" himself. This goes back to the use of "writs of assistance" or general standing warrants that gave British law enforcement officials in Massachusetts -- Adams’ home state -- wide powers to inspect the property and possessions of colonists in order to root out the proceeds of smuggling. These warrants were long-lasting -- up to six months after the death of the issuing sovereign -- and they permitted officials to enter any house during the day. They did not require officials to obtain a more specific permission from a judge -- what would today be called a search warrant. Not surprisingly, many colonists saw these broad governmental powers as onerous. The issue came to a head in 1761, when a Boston lawyer, James Otis Jr., led a group seeking redress from the court. Otis and his fellow complainants lost the case, but their arguments made a deep impression on Adams, then a 25-year-old lawyer who was in the courtroom when the case was heard. Two documents show the significance of this case in Adams’ mind. One was a letter to his wife, Abigail, on July 3, 1776 -- 15 years later, and the day before the signing of the Declaration of Independence: "When I look back to the Year 1761, and recollect the Argument concerning Writs of Assistance, in the Superiour Court, which I have hitherto considered as the Commencement of the Controversy, between Great Britain and America, and run through the whole Period from that Time to this, and recollect the series of political Events, the Chain of Causes and Effects, I am surprized at the Suddenness, as well as Greatness of this Revolution." The second document was a letter Adams wrote to his former student, William Tudor, in 1817, more than half a century after the court arguments. Tudor was assembling Otis’ papers posthumously. "Every Man of an immense crouded Audience appeared to me to go away, as I did, ready to take Arms against Writs of Assistants. Then and there was the first scene of the first Act of opposition to the Arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the Child Independence was born. In fifteen years i.e. in 1776. he grew up to Manhood, & declared himself free." While some sources imply that Adams himself used the term "spark," such as a Heritage Foundation guide to the Constitution, it was actually his grandson, Charles Francis Adams, who did. In 1856, Adams’ grandson published a biography of the second president. In it, the grandson wrote, "In the year 1761, arose the question respecting the legality of writs of assistance, argued before the superior court of the province, by James Otis, and which Mr. Adams himself considered as the spark in which originated the American Revolution. … No man can attentively read it without observing, in the argument, the seeds profusely scattered of the Revolution of Independence." So Paul is generally correct about the centrality of the Otis case for Adams, even if Adams himself never used the word "spark." Was the Fourth Amendment "what we fought the Revolution over"? According to experts we contacted, concerns about searches and seizures are more accurately described as one of the causes of the American Revolution, rather than "what we fought the Revolution over." "The origins and issues over which the American Revolution was fought are complex, varied, and to this day, even among historians, debatable," said Amanda M. Norton, assistant editor of the Adams Papers at the Massachusetts Historical Society. While Adams did credit Otis’ argument, whether or not he was correct on that point "is a matter of debate." Serena Zabin, a Carleton College historian who specializes in the revolutionary era, agreed. "It’s a gross oversimplification to say that the American Revolution as a whole was fought over search and seizure. Other key factors certainly include the British Empire trying to control white settlers from taking native Indian land, political arguments over economic regulations, and eventually a rising series of provocations and complaints on both sides." The best place to look for a list of causes of the revolution is the Declaration of Independence, added Brian Murphy, an early-American historian at Baruch College of the City University of New York. These include the king’s refusal to acknowledge representative government, his close control of the judiciary, the forced quartering of British soldiers, the imposition of taxes without consent, and the provoking of Indian insurrections against the colonists, among many others cited in the founding document. "The British lost the colonies through some very stupid, unforced errors, and (search and seizure) is one of those things," Murphy said. When we contacted Paul’s campaign, spokeswoman Eleanor May said that Paul didn’t claim that the Fourth Amendment was the only cause of the American Revolution. "Sen. Paul stands by his statement, though he encourages every American to read the work of John Adams and our other Founding Fathers and draw their own conclusions," May said. Our ruling Paul said, "The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over. John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence." Paul definitely has a point. Adams’ writings clearly show that he believed the writs of assistance case was a key, early turning point of the revolution that began 15 years later. But even if it was one cause, it wasn’t the only one. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06232	Says he followed state law and the precedent of other Massachusetts governors when he erased electronic communications as he left office.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/02/mitt-romney/romney-says-he-followed-law-and-precedent-taking-h/	When Mitt Romney left office after four years as Massachusetts governor, his staff took their computer records with them. According to a series of articles published last month in the Boston Globe, they bought their computer hard drives and wiped the administration’s server clean of e-mails and other records. The maneuvers have left Romney’s successor, current Gov. Deval Patrick, without any digital records from Romney’s administration, and Patrick’s staff has been unable to meet the many public records requests filed during Romney’s presidential campaign, the Globe reported. But, in an interview last week with The Telegraph’s editorial board, Romney said his staff's actions were legal. "In government, we should follow the law," Romney said in the November 20, 2011 interview. "There has never been an administration (in Massachusetts) that has provided to the opposition research team, or to the public, electronic communications," he said. "So ours would have been the first administration to have done so." Romney’s claims bring up two questions: Did his staff, which reportedly purchased 11 computers, follow the state public records law? And how have past Massachusetts governors treated electronic records? PolitiFact is on the case. First, we took a look at Massachusetts' public records law. The law, which requires state officials to preserve records for a set amount of time, is fairly clear about electronic records. "The Public Records Law applies to all government records generated, received or maintained electronically, including computer records, electronic mail, video and audiotapes," William Galvin, Secretary of the Commonwealth, wrote in a 2009 guide to the state law. But the Massachusetts governor’s office is not subject to these regulations, according to the state Supreme Court. In 1997, the court issued a ruling that effectively exempts the governor’s office from the public records law's requirements. In the ruling, Ann K. Lambert vs. Executive Director of the Judicial Nominating Council, the court determined that judicial nomination documents submitted to the state's governor are not public because the governor’s office is not "explicitly included" in the state records law. "Were we to conclude that the public records law included the records ..., a conflict could arise between the legislation and the executive order which could impair the Governor’s ability to exercise his constitutional responsibility," the justices wrote. In the years since, this decision hasn’t stopped governors from submitting records to the state archives, according to former staff members. . Both before and after the Lambert decision, administration staff members, including those under Romney, have submitted records to the state archives, according to Terry Dolan, who served as director of administration for six governors, including Romney, between 1985 and 2008. But to her recollection, none of the former governors -- Michael Dukakis, William Weld, Paul Cellucci, Jane Swift nor Romney -- have submitted electronic records to the archives. Nor have state record-keepers received any, according to Brian McNiff, a spokesman for the Secretary of the Commonwealth, who oversees the public records division. As they left office, each of the governors submitted hundreds of boxes of paper records to the records center, said Dolan, who now works at Northeastern University’s Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy. The only electronic records and communications that were included were when the governor's staff included printouts of some of them, she said. McNiff, of the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s office, said records submitted from the Romney administration included print-outs of electronic records. It would be tough to track how many, but it’s "safe to say e-mail printouts do not make up the bulk of material," McNiff wrote in an e-mail. As for whether governors leave records for incoming administrations, Dolan said staff members routinely passed along some documents, both electronic and physical, which may prove valuable to the incoming governor. Some records, including those involving ongoing legislation, legal cases and gubernatorial appointments, extended into the following administration, she said, and governors, including Romney, passed those along to their successors. But, aside from those, staffers generally cleared all staff computers of past records during the transition period, Dolan said. "That was the routine," she said. "Computers to the best of my recollection would be re-imaged and old files deleted between administrations. … You wouldn’t just start up your computer and find files waiting there." Our ruling The Romney administration’s decision to erase most electronic files is neither illegal nor unusual. According to state records officials, past governors such as Weld, Cellucci and Swift have not made their electronic records available to the state archive or to the incoming administration, according to state staff. They have submitted some computer print-outs to the state archive, but Romney did that, as well. So we rate Romney's claim True. UPDATE: The last paragraph originally included a reference to to the removal of the hard drives. That reference has been removed to clarify that ruling is on Romney's claim about deleting the records.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-12-02T17:59:04	2011-11-21	['Massachusetts']
pomt-00768	Says Bill Clinton signed a law "very similar to," and Barack Obama voted for a law "something like," Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-bill-clinton-barack-obama-backed/	Concerns about Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act were broad enough that the head coaches competing in the Final Four college basketball championship, including Wisconsin's Bo Ryan, issued a joint statement saying "discrimination of any kind should not be tolerated." The Indiana law, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, "allows individuals to use religion as an excuse to discriminate against LGBT people and other minorities." Yet later on the day the coaches issued their statement, April 1, 2015, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called reactions from around the country overblown, saying the new law is not so unusual. Asked by Charlie Sykes, a conservative radio talk show host in Milwaukee, if he would sign Indiana's law, Walker replied: "We don't need to. In Wisconsin, we have it in our Constitution." The front-running potential presidential candidate added: "And remember, it's not just what we have here. I mean, President Clinton signed something very similar to this nationally back in '93. President Obama voted for something like this in the neighboring state of Illinois when he was a state senator. I just think this is people who are chronically looking for ways to be upset about things, instead of really looking at what it is." So, is the Indiana law merely a similar version of a federal law signed by Bill Clinton and an Illinois law backed by Barack Obama? The backdrop All of this dates back more than 30 years to Alfred Smith and Galen Black. They worked as alcohol and drug counselors at a private drug rehabilitation organization in Oregon. Both were members of the Native American Church and, for sacramental purposes, ingested small amounts of peyote, an illegal, hallucinogenic drug, during a church ceremony. They were later fired, one of them in 1983 and one in 1984. The two were denied unemployment compensation under an Oregon law that disqualified employees who were discharged for work-related "misconduct" and their case went to court. In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that Oregon could prohibit the religious use of peyote, and therefore could deny unemployment compensation to the two workers. That ruling led to federal legislation -- which, like the Indiana law, is called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- that Clinton signed into law in 1993. Four years later, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law didn’t apply to states. That kicked off a spree of states passing their own versions of the law. Currently, 21 states have such religious freedom laws. In 2015, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 16 states have introduced legislation regarding the creation of, or alteration to, a state religious freedom law. (Wisconsin is not among the 21 or the 16.) Language The intent of the 1993 federal law was to protect religious practices -- such as Native Americans using peyote as part of religious practices, or a Muslim prison guard wearing a beard -- from government interference. Illinois, in 1998, was among the initial wave of states that approved state versions of the federal law. All Illinois state senators, including Obama, voted for it. Indiana’s law carries the same title as the federal and Illinois laws and much of the same language. But there are a couple of differences. Under Indiana’s law a "person" is extended to mean "a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association" or other entity. That doesn’t appear in the federal law. However, the federal law has now been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court (in what is known as the Hobby Lobby case) to extend in this same way to private companies and associations. Indiana’s law states it can be used to protect religious freedom in private disputes, even if the government is not a party. That provision has been viewed as having been written to specifically cover a situation such as a New Mexico photographer who did not want to participate in a same-sex wedding. However, the day after Walker made his claim, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed a revision to the law. The revised law prohibits service providers from using it as a legal defense for refusing to provide goods, services, facilities or accommodations. It also bars discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or U.S. military service. Context On another level, the context between the federal and Illinois laws on the one hand, and the Indiana law on the other, has changed. Whereas the earlier laws were adopted to protect religious practices from government interference, conservatives in Indiana and elsewhere see the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a vehicle for fighting back against the legalization of same-sex marriage. At the private signing ceremony for the original version of the Indiana law, people who work for groups that oppose same-sex marriage were in attendance. And one of the lobbyists heralded the state’s law as protecting Christian bakers, florists and photographers from penalty "for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage, among other examples." Generally speaking, there isn’t all that much difference between the Indiana law and the Illinois and federal laws. But proponents of the Indiana law are pushing the measure as a way that businesses can seek protection "for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage." That was far from what prompted the federal and Illinois laws. A final note: Another possible GOP presidential contender, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, made a claim similar to Walker’s, saying Florida has a religious freedom law like Indiana’s. PolitiFact Florida found the Florida law is in line with the federal law, and rated Bush’s statement Half True. Our rating Walker said Bill Clinton signed a federal law "very similar to," and Obama voted for an Illinois law "something like," Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The three laws share the same title and much of the same language, but Indiana’s law has at least two significant provisions that the other two laws don’t. Moreover, the federal and Illinois laws were passed with the intent to protect various religious practices from government intervention. Conversely, supporters of the Indiana law see it as a vehicle for fighting back against the legalization of same-sex marriage. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.

pomt-01721	Africa is spending "the highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/07/michael-bloomberg/bloomberg-africa-spends-more-education-any-other-p/	Statesmen from nearly 50 African countries are in Washington this week for President Barack Obama’s historic African Leaders Summit, which has been billed as an attempt to strengthen the United States’ economic investments in Africa. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the summit on Aug. 3’s Face the Nation, pointing to investments from Chinese companies in African infrastructure. And education spending, Bloomberg said, is the best evidence of big things to come in Africa. "China has looked at it and said this is a place where because they are spending highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world, although in all fairness it's starting small," he said. "But you are going to create a middle class there that's going to want an awful lot of the products." "The next big cities," he said, "are going to be in Africa." That seemed to contradict the Western trope that African schools aren’t meeting the needs of their students. What we found is that Bloomberg is in the ballpark looking at data from 2008 but wrong when looking at more recent numbers. Looking back to 2008 While we didn’t hear from Bloomberg, he may have been thinking of an article in his Bloomberg Businessweek by Howard French, author of China’s Second Continent: How a Million Migrants Are Building a New Empire in Africa. "African investment in education, among the highest in the world in terms of percentage of GDP, can barely keep up with the heavy demand for learning," French wrote, going on to cite Africa’s recent gains in school enrollment across all levels of learning. French referred us to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, "Lions on the move: The progress and potential of African economies." That report pegs Africa’s public spending on education as a percentage of GDP at 5 percent in 2008. That’s "a smaller portion than the OECD countries’ 6 percent," they wrote, "but more than in Latin America or some Asian countries." The OECD, or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is composed of 34 countries in every continent except Africa that are generally considered developed and high-income. The above graph from a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) report expands on the data from the McKinsey study and looks at spending per region across the globe. Both reports, we should note, only look at public spending on education -- data on private education spending isn’t readily available for non-OECD countries. If you take education spending as a percentage of government spending, not GDP, Africa actually beats out the OECD, 20 percent to 11, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. But looking at 2008 figures -- as did all the reports we found that looked at education spending for continents -- Bloomberg’s wrong. Africa’s close, and their progress on education is impressive by other measures, but the world’s developed nations spend proportionally more on education. Updating the data But part of the buzz about Africa is that its governments are rapidly increasing their spending on education. For instance, a 2011 UN report noted that Africa had increased its education spending by an average of 6 percent a year from 2000 to 2010. The 2008 data also isn’t perfect, because some notable countries are missing, including China. So we set out to update the UN and McKinsey’s analysis with more recent data. Every year, UNESCO publishes public education spending as a percentage of GDP for every country where it’s available, which works out to less than half of the 196 recognized countries almost every year. The World Bank keeps a database of these numbers, year-by-year. To update the stats from UNESCO and McKinsey, we took the World Bank’s dataset and removed every country that hadn’t published new data since 2008. Then we took the most recent figure for the remaining 160 countries, and multiplied each country’s percentage by its most recent GDP figure from the World Bank to get an estimate for total education spending for each country. The data for every country is the most recent available, though the data isn’t the same year for every country. We then broke down the countries into geographic regions using a UN classification -- which segregates countries more or less by continents -- and took the total education spending for each region and divided it by each region’s total GDP to get weighted averages. The results: Source: PunditFact.com As you can see from the chart above, Africa lags behind Latin America and Oceania, in addition to Northern America (the UN name for North America) and Europe. The picture could look different for education spending as a percentage of government spending instead of GDP -- African countries’ spending on education is increasing alongside their GDPs, albeit at a slightly slower rate -- but that’s not how Bloomberg framed his claim. Our ruling On Face the Nation, Bloomberg said that Africa is spending "the highest percentage of their GDP on education of any part of the world" in the course of praising China’s investment in Africa’s growth. Reports from the United Nations had Africa’s proportional spending on education higher than everywhere but North America and Europe in 2008. But since then, Africa’s overall economic growth has outpaced its governments increasing spending on education. Our calculations based on the most recent available data put Africa’s proportional spending beneath every continent except Asia. African countries do spend more of their governments’ budgets on education than many developed countries, so Bloomberg’s broader point about Africa’s growth has some merit. But Bloomberg’s claim cited GDP. We rate his claim False.	None	Michael Bloomberg	None	None	None	2014-08-07T11:56:42	2014-08-03	['None']
pomt-09895	"Job losses are so certain under this new cap-and-tax plan that it includes a provision accommodating newly unemployed workers from the resulting dried-up energy sector, to the tune of $4.2 billion over eight years. So much for creating jobs."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/16/sarah-palin/palin-claims-cap-and-trade-bill-includes-42-billio/	Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has been making waves in the blogosphere with a recent op-ed on cap-and-trade. Her critics say Palin's July 14, 2009, piece in the Washington Post gets it all wrong. It "displays an ignorance for the subject so profound it's almost gutsy," Conor Clarke wrote in the Atlantic . Keith Olberman said on Countdown that she uses "the sky-is-falling tactics." We've explored other aspects of the cap-and-trade bill before, including how much it would cost lower-income consumers (Palin says it would hit them hardest, but the independent Congressional Budget Office predicts it would actually put money in the pockets of the poorest), as well as how much of an impact the bill would really have on climate. Today, we're tackling this claim from Palin's op-ed: "Job losses are so certain under this new cap-and-tax plan that it includes a provision accommodating newly unemployed workers from the resulting dried-up energy sector, to the tune of $4.2 billion over eight years. So much for creating jobs." Before we dig into Palin's statement, here's a quick summary of how the cap-and-trade bill, authored by Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, would work. The bill aims to slow climate change by lowering carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. To do that, the bill would cap yearly carbon emissions, and to comply, companies will have to either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits to continue polluting. Initially, the government's permits for polluters would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government. Palin and other Republicans say they are concerned that the transition will be costly to industry — particularly companies in the energy sector — and that workers will lose their jobs as a result. The authors of the bill are also concerned — so much so that they included the program Palin refers to. Should workers lose their jobs, they would get 156 weeks of benefits, including 70 percent of their average weekly wage, help paying for health insurance, job training and employment search assistance. So, Palin is correct that the bill has a program for displaced workers. Funding for the program would come from selling those pollution allowances we mentioned earlier. Supporters of cap-and-trade argue that Palin's statement is misleading because she makes it seem like, overall, the bill is killing jobs. They say she neglects to point out that it will add thousands of jobs in industries that will grow because of the dramatic policy change. Bracken Hendricks, a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, recently predicted the bill would create 1.7 million new jobs. The program Palin's talking about will also help train those workers to participate in the emerging industry. "In an economic shift from pollution to clean energy, some sectors will see impacts," he said. "But this policy isn't about job loss, it's about anticipated growth. ... The expectation is that there will be a net job creation." So, back to Palin's claim. She's correct that there is a program in the bill that would help displaced workers, but she paints a narrow view of how the bill will affect employment. Yes, some workers will be displaced and need to be retrained, but some experts are projecting growth and new jobs in industries that benefit from the new policy. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-14732	"Secretary Clinton changes her position on (gun issues) every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/19/martin-omalley/fact-checking-omalleys-claim-hillary-clinton-flips/	Hillary Clinton goes wherever the wind blows on gun control, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said at a Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire. "Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President (Barack) Obama and saying we don't need federal standards," O’Malley said at the Dec. 19, 2015, debate hosted by ABC News. In the wake of several mass shootings this year, Clinton has pushed for stronger federal gun control, so we decided to look back and see if O’Malley is correct that she had a different position on the issue in the past. O’Malley’s campaign sent us several news articles detailing Clinton’s stance on guns. Pre-2008 From the time she was first lady through her 2000 Senate run in New York, Clinton supported strict federal gun control measures. In 1993, then-President Bill Clinton signed into law the Brady bill, which mandated federal background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases, as well as an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. As first lady, Hillary Clinton supported these measures. "The first step is to take weapons off the streets and to put more police on them," she wrote in her 1996 book It Takes a Village. "Since (the Brady bill) was enacted, more than 40,000 people with criminal records have been prevented from buying guns." Following the Columbine, Colo., school shooting in April 1999, Clinton pushed for more gun control, including a proposal to raise the legal age to own a handgun from 18 to 21. And during her 2000 Senate run, Clinton endorsed gun registration, photo licenses for gun owners and ballistic fingerprinting. Clinton continued to push for more gun control while serving as the senator from New York, but in her 2008 presidential run, she seemed to back off a bit. 2008 Positioning herself to the right of then-Sen. Barack Obama, Clinton spoke throughout the campaign about the importance of guns to American culture while still defending Bill Clinton’s record on gun control. "You know, my dad took me out behind the cottage that my grandfather built on a little lake called Lake Winola outside of Scranton and taught me how to shoot when I was a little girl," she said at a town hall in 2008. At a 2008 Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Clinton gave an affirmative "yes" that she was backing off her 2000 call for a national licensing and registration plan because it would "preempt" cities and states’ initiatives. But she also called for reinstating the assault weapons ban and better background checks for potential gun purchasers. Clinton responded to another question about her position on a gun registry at a debate in Philadelphia. "What might work in New York City is certainly not going to work in Montana," she said, explaining her reason to abandon the proposal. "So, for the federal government to be having any kind of, you know, blanket rules that they're going to try to impose, I think doesn't make sense." "I respect the Second Amendment. I respect the rights of lawful gun owners to own guns, to use their guns," she went on to say later in the debate. "But I also believe that most lawful gun owners whom I have spoken with for many years across our country also want to be sure that we keep those guns out of the wrong hands." While Clinton clearly was no longer in favor of a gun registry out of professed concern for individual states’ needs, she did not wholly reject all federal gun laws. 2016 More so than in her 2008 campaign, Clinton has been forceful and impassioned about gun control this cycle, pushing for universal background checks, closing the so-called gun show loophole, and a bill that aims to stop people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns, among several other measures. "This epidemic of gun violence knows no boundaries," she said in a recent campaign ad. "We’re better than this. We need to close the loopholes and support universal background checks. How many people have to die before we actually act? Before we come together as a nation?" Clinton’s list of the gun control measures she would support does not, though, include the gun licensing and registration program she advocated for in 2000 but backed off of in 2008. In sum, O’Malley does have a point that Clinton’s rhetoric and her position on a few specific gun control measures shifted from 2000 to 2008, and then from 2008 to 2015. But in her 2008 campaign, she was not really against all "federal standards" because she still called for some federal gun control measures, such as reinstating the assault weapons ban. Our ruling O’Malley "Secretary Clinton changes her position on (gun issues) every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards." In 2000, in the wake of the Columbine school shooting, Clinton was emphatic about her support for gun control. In 2008, she dropped her support for a gun license and registration proposal and positioned herself to the right of her major opponent, Obama. While Clinton also advocated for leaving some gun control to the states, she still advocated for federal gun control efforts, and she never said "we don’t need federal standards." In 2015, Clinton has been more forceful with her support for gun control than she was in 2008 -- closer to her rhetoric in 2000. O’Malley has a point that Clinton’s positioning on gun control has shifted between election cycles, but it wasn’t nearly as dramatic as he made it out to be. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-05604	Says the Wisconsin Republican Party tweeted "Happy International Women's Day! You ladies should get paid less and not be able to make health care decisions."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/28/graeme-zielinski/wisconsin-democratic-party-spokesman-zielinski-say/	In the recall election facing Gov. Scott Walker, parties and activists from all sides are tweeting a steady stream of commentary, tips and insults. One of the most prolific tweeters is Graeme Zielinski, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. Zielinski tweets several times a day, and has more than 1,000 followers. His personal account lists his position with the state party. Most of the time, Zielinski offers his own opinions about politics and stories of the day. Occasionally, he "retweets" things posted by others -- the Twitter way to share those views with your own readers, sometimes with a little extra commentary. This appeared to be what was going on in one of Zielinski’s messages on March 8, 2012. We often get suggestions from readers, including political figures and campaigns. The original message was pointed out to us by Ciara Matthews, campaign spokeswoman for Walker. Here’s what Zielineski tweeted: RT @WisGOP: Happy International Women's Day! You ladies should get paid less and not be able to make health care decisions. For those unfamiliar with Twitter, here’s what is behind the lingo: The tweet made it appear as if Zielinski was "re-tweeting" (RT) a message put out by the Wisconsin Republican Party (@WisGOP). While Zielinski is often sarcastic in his posts, this one appeared to be a straightforward retweet. One little problem: The state GOP never tweeted it. We asked Zielinski where the message came from. His response: "It was me ‘Tweeting’ as them, since they voted to cut equal pay protections and put new roadblocks in between women and their doctors." Ok. That’s pretty simple.The tweet was fabricated to try and make a point. It's unclear what measures Zielinski was referring to. We previously examined a claim regarding a bill on the equal pay issue awaiting action by Walker. State Rep. Cory Mason (D-Racine) claimed legislation approved by state Republicans would repeal a law that ensures "that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job." We rated that statement False because the bill in question does not ensure pay equity, but relates to the rights of workers to sue in state court over discrimination-related damages. Walker has also drawn criticism for canceling a state contract with Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, which provides services related to the cancer screenings in four counties. The actual screenings, however, didn’t end but were taken over by Winnebago County (Indeed, the contract in question related not to providing the screenings, but a program to help sign people up to get them). We rated Pants on Fire a statement by U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) that claimed Waker "eliminated ‘cancer screenings for uninsured women’ and offered ‘no alternatives.’" We asked the state GOP for its response to the fake tweet under its name. "As a former reporter for The Onion, Graeme clearly has the experience to completely fabricate content for his frivolous attacks, and it highlights the utter lack of integrity of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, given they employ his false attacks as the official message of their organization," wrote party spokesman Ben Sparks. It also appears the faked message violates the Twitter rules known as the "terms of service." "By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms," Twitter says. Here’s a key rule, listed first under "Content Boundaries and Use of Twitter": Impersonation: You may not impersonate others through the Twitter service in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse, or deceive others. And here’s another: Twitter users are not allowed to "in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information." Our rating (in under 140 characters) In a tweet, Zielinski said the state GOP tweeted an insulting message about women. Not true. He made it up. Pants on Fire.

pomt-03706	"Women make 77 cents for every dollar earned by men."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/18/gina-raimondo/ri-treasurer-gina-raimondo-repeats-oft-quoted-misl/	In anticipation of Equal Pay Day on April 9, Rhode Island State Treasurer Gina Raimondo sent out a tweet declaring, "Women make 77 cents for every dollar earned by men." It sounds very unfair, and the statistic has become an oft-repeated rallying cry for wage equity. But PolitiFact has found, in several analyses, that the statistic is misleading. It's all about the context. The 77-cent figure comes from the U.S. Census Bureau. It's based on annual pay and it only includes men and women who work full time and year round -- about 67.8 percent of the total work force, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thus, that estimate excludes one-third of the work force. The amount rises to 82 cents if you look at weekly wages, according to other BLS data. That estimate also includes teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers who are left out of the Census Bureau estimate if they are not working year-round or full time. That's up a penny from the previous year. The gap closes even more -- to 87 cents -- if you compare hourly wages for men and women. This comes from Table 9 of the BLS data and it includes part-time jobs, which are often filled by women. Going back to weekly wages, on Table 5 of that report, if you look at part-time work (less than 35 hours), women earned 5 cents more for every dollar earned by men. Women who worked 35 to 39 hours earned nearly 10 cents more than men. But as soon as the number of hours rose to 40 hours, women's earnings dropped to about 87 cents per dollar. The underlying concern here is that women are being paid less than men for doing the same job. Job-by-job data are harder to come by, but there is evidence that the gender difference is not as wide as the 77-cents-per-dollar statistic suggests. We went to Table 2 of that BLS report to look at specific occupations. In most cases, there were not enough data to make a gender comparison. But in the 113 instances where it was possible, women earned less than 77 cents on the dollar in 28 jobs and more than 77 cents in 85 jobs. In five jobs -- such as computer support specialists, medical scientists and stock clerks and order filers -- the average weekly wage for women was higher than for men. The U.S. Department of Labor looked at the question in a 2009 report. It noted that there are several work-related attributes of women and men that account for most of the wage gap. So its statistical analysis adjusted for the fact that women are more likely to work part-time (where the pay for everyone tends to be lower), leave the labor force for children or elder care, and gravitate toward "family friendly" occupations where compensation is more likely to be in the form of health insurance or other fringe benefits. It found that women earned 93-95 cents for every dollar earned by men. Raimondo's spokeswoman, Joy Fox, responded to our inquiry with an e-mail that said, in part, "We are referring to the widely-used across-the-workforce number that is from the Census report." She added, "this has also been quoted by numerous respectable sources" such as the American Association of University Women, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, the National Committee on Pay Equity and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook. Our ruling Gina Raimondo said, "Women make 77 cents for every dollar earned by men." That's only true for one oft-cited statistic that does not, for example, look at part-time jobs where women tend to make more per week and does not address the crucial underlying question of whether women are getting equal pay for equal work. The gap shrinks -- sometimes considerably -- when complicating factors such as pay per hour or the decisions of women to leave the work force to raise children are considered. The 77-cent statistic has been widely cited by PolitiFact and other fact-checkers as oversimplified and misleading, yet it is still being used without qualification. On the other hand, other reliable measures of pay by gender also show that a significant gap persists, although not in all professions. Because Raimondo's statement leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-08333	"Most of the jobs that we lost were lost before the economic policies we put in place had any effect."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/28/barack-obama/obama-says-most-job-loss-occurred-his-economic-pol/	President Barack Obama had jobs on his mind when he sat down Oct. 27, 2010, for a pre-election interview on Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Under questioning from Stewart, Obama came back to a familiar theme: When he took office, he inherited a mess. "We lost 4 million jobs before I was sworn in; 750,000 the month I was sworn in; 600,000, the month after that; 600,000 the month after that. So most of the jobs that we lost were lost before the economic policies we put in place had any effect." Candidates have sparred endlessly over who deserves the blame for the nation’s high unemployment rate -- 9.6 percent in the latest tally. After the Daily Show interview, one of our readers asked us to check Obama's numbers. So we decided to take a look. Obama didn't give a time frame for the 4 million lost jobs other than to say the losses occurred before he took office. We checked with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, official keeper of the jobs statistics, to see if the numbers matched up in some way. We found a match: Looking at BLS data on seasonally adjusted non-farm employment from December 2007, when the recession officially began, to January 2009, the month before the stimulus was enacted (a 13-month period), the jobs number declined by 4.4 million. So Obama’s first number was right, although he could have been clearer about the time frame. When he refers to his economic policies, we presume he is referring to his main economic stimulus, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It passed in February 2009, but it took several months before the impact of its spending was felt in the economy. Job loss didn’t stop, but Obama is right that it slowed down. In the 19 months from February 2009 through September 2010, the month of the most recent preliminary data, the overall job decline in the private and public sectors was 2.6 million. And the number of jobs lost per month has declined from around 700,000 a month at the beginning of the administration to months in which there were small net gains. Since May, however, the losses -- albeit smaller ones -- have returned, giving Republicans fresh ammunition. For example, payroll employment dropped 57,000 between July and August 2010. "I watched the president on Stewart’s show last night, and I thought his basic point about the timing of the employment losses was correct and ought to be noncontroversial," Gary Burtless, a labor markets expert at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution said in an e-mail. There's still plenty to debate about the stimulus and its impact on the economy, and the recent reversal of job gains is troubling. But the numbers support Obama's statement, so we rate it True.

pomt-04304	Says Bill Young "voted twice for the Ryan budget that ends the current Medicare system."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/30/jessica-ehrlich/jessica-ehrlich-says-bill-young-voted-twice-end-cu/	U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young began his tenure in Congress in 1970, a streak that makes the 81-year-old from Indian Shores the longest-serving Republican in the U.S. House. The first-time candidate challenging Young’s re-election does not want voters to forget it. Democratic attorney Jessica Ehrlich, 38, sponsored a TV attack ad that she says is the first commercial challenging Young in 20 years. It’s called "1970." Narrator: "Before the Tampa Bay Bucs, Nixon was president, disco was on the rise, and Bill Young was in Congress." Ehrlich: "I'm Jessica Ehrlich, and Bill Young is a nice man, but after 42 years in Congress he's lost touch. Why else would he vote twice for the Ryan budget that ends the current Medicare system? Seniors pay thousands more each year, and the wealthy get more tax cuts." We’re not surprised to hear Ehrlich challenge Young’s record on Medicare, the health care program for seniors. The issue is of particular relevance to Young’s constituents in Congressional District 13th, about 22 percent of whom are senior citizens. We’re also not surprised to hear she chose this line of attack. Democrats have sent grave warnings about Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and his budget proposals for the past couple years, heightening their attacks after Mitt Romney chose Ryan as his running mate. Ehrlich’s message that Young voted for a budget "that ends the current Medicare system" is similar to attacks PolitiFact previously deemed too much of a stretch. The Democrats’ rallying cry that Republicans voted to "end Medicare" was our 2011 "Lie of the Year." We’ve also heard the refined version that Republicans want to end Medicare "as we know it." We heard good arguments from experts who said his plan does not end Medicare "as we know it" and those who said it did, so we did not rate that claim. Where does Ehrlich’s claim fall? Do the Ryan budgets end the current Medicare system? Without question, Ryan’s vision would substantially change Medicare. Medicare is a fast-growing program within the federal budget, and both parties agree that reform is necessary to preserve it. The Democrats, led by President Barack Obama, want to keep Medicare largely the way it is but with more regulations and oversight of payments to doctors and hospitals. The Republicans want private insurers to be more involved and let the marketplace lower costs, and Ryan has led that charge as House Budget Committee chairman. Ryan would leave Medicare in its current form for people who are 55 and older. Most attacks from Democrats omit this important detail. It’s a different story for future beneficiaries. In short, they would receive government subsidies to buy their own plans. "That is completely a different system than the one that we currently have," Ehrlich said in an interview. The charge isn’t accurate because Ryan’s new plan keeps traditional Medicare as an option, Young said in an interview. "It’s ridiculous to think that in a district like mine that a member of Congress would vote in a negative way on Social Security and Medicare," he said. PolitiFact rated Democratic critiques that Republicans want "to turn Medicare into a voucher system" Mostly True. Ryan’s 2011 budget plan -- a resolution that does not carry the force of law -- would not have provided a traditional Medicare plan, leaving seniors to use their voucher-like credits on strictly private insurance plans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost seniors $6,400 in extra health care costs. Ryan responded to criticism about his original plan by including a traditional Medicare plan in his more recent version. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange, among other adjustments to the original plan. Ryan’s plan includes constraints on private insurers, including that they would have to cover services stipulated by the federal government, and poor and sicker people would get larger subsidies. Romney has said he supports the Ryan plan’s goals and that his own plan for Medicare would be close to identical. We fact-checkers don’t know if seniors would pay "thousands more each year" for health care, as Ehrlich claimed in the ad, because Ryan has not submitted the 2012 plan to CBO for analysis. The Democrats warn that if Ryan’s plan doesn’t drive down prices as much as he hopes, beneficiaries would pay more or lose benefits. In another scenario, the government could increase the amount of credits to keep up with costs, but that erodes the goal of the government saving money. Young voted for Ryan’s previous budget resolutions in 2011 and 2012. Our ruling A TV ad from Jessica Ehrlich claims Bill Young voted "twice for the Ryan budget that ends the current Medicare system." Indeed, Young voted in favor of two Ryan budget blueprints that fundamentally change how Medicare works. Instead of the government paying for individual health services for seniors, seniors would receive a voucher-like credit toward the insurance plan of their choice, which includes a traditional Medicare option. Some argue the Democrats, too, are ending the current Medicare system by moving it from an open-ended entitlement program to one that tries to rein in spending by controlling how much physicians and insurers are reimbursed. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. So we rate it Half True.	None	Jessica Ehrlich	None	None	None	2012-10-30T18:56:01	2012-10-08	['None']
pomt-04681	Ohio has "created 45,000 new manufacturing jobs since 2010. And that's due in large part to the fact that the auto rescue has helped Ohio."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/ted-strickland/strickland-credits-auto-rescue-ohio-manufacturing-/	With jobs at the center of the presidential race, Democrats tout the revival of the American auto industry as a prime success story of the Obama administration. Former Democratic Ohio governor, Ted Strickland, made that connection when he appeared on Meet the Press last month. Strickland said unemployment in Ohio was below the national average and his state had "created 45,000 new manufacturing jobs since 2010. And that's due in large part to the fact that the auto rescue has helped Ohio." We have examined the resurgence of the Ohio auto industry before. Republican Gov. John Kasich downplayed its impact on the state’s overall economy. We rated that Mostly True. Strickland is giving the auto bailout particular credit for growth in the manufacturing sector and that specific connection is one that we look into now. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Strickland has it right for the number of manufacturing jobs in Ohio. They went up by about 47,000 between the start of 2010 and the middle of 2012. Where he gets into trouble is proving that a large part of the job growth is due to the automotive sector. Jobs in building cars and making the parts that go into cars did go up, but only by a bit over 5,000, or 12 percent of the total increase. That’s not a small fraction, but it doesn’t seem to qualify as a "large part." We contacted Strickland’s colleagues at the Ohio Democratic Party for supporting details and they did not provide any. However, the direct job figures don’t tell the whole story. The supply chain that feeds into a finished car is long and complicated. The BLS tracks the car parts industry, but it doesn’t track the other manufacturing jobs that supply auto parts makers. An analysis by the Center for Automotive Research, an independent group that gets some support from the auto industry, found that the number of jobs in metals, plastics and rubber that are tied to auto parts makers is about half again larger than the number of jobs in the auto parts sector itself. It is very difficult to know how this ripple effect plays out in Ohio itself. "The problem is we have these artificial boundaries called state borders," said Kim Hill, associate research director at the Center. "An assembly plant in Michigan can produce jobs at a Mom and Pop tool and die maker in Ohio and vice versa." Hill says often, the small firms themselves aren't aware of the connection. James Rubenstein, a professor at Miami University, has drilled into the complex connections among manufacturers in the car business. "A very high percentage of steel produced in Ohio goes to the auto industry," Rubenstein said. And he added, the pattern would carry through for all primary metals, machine shops and other fabricators. The larger the fraction of steel, for example, that went to cars, the larger the number of jobs attributable to the industry. Some of those downstream companies could be selling to car makers and car part suppliers in other states. The revival of the car industry was not limited to Ohio. It also took hold in places such as Michigan, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Increased activity there could produce jobs in Ohio. As a final complication, Strickland tied the auto industry to manufacturing in general. At some level, when people have jobs, they buy some big ticket items such as washing machines and refrigerators. Those purchases also would generate manufacturing jobs. The problem is, we could find no clear tally of all of these possible effects. Based on the numbers we can find for manufacturing jobs that feed into the supply chain of auto parts, we might take the figure from the Center for Automotive Research and say that those jobs might account for another 4,000 manufacturing workers in Ohio due to the auto industry. If one counted all of those jobs, that would still translate into only about 20 percent of the manufacturing jobs added in the state. Our Ruling Strickland said that Ohio "created 45,000 new manufacturing jobs since 2010. And that's due in large part to the fact that the auto rescue has helped Ohio." Strickland is right on the big number. Giving major credit to the auto industry is a harder case to make. Based on the information gathered by the BLS, the automobile sector accounted for just one-eighth of the new manufacturing jobs. There are good reasons to believe that the impact of the auto industry, both within and outside of Ohio, generated a larger impact on manufacturing jobs, but it is difficult to quantify. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2012-09-06T18:24:43	2012-08-05	['Ohio']
pomt-09649	Labor union president Andy Stern is "the most frequent visitor" at the White House.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/07/glenn-beck/beck-says-labor-leader-most-frequent-white-house-v/	Fox News Channel host Glenn Beck recently found another rhetorical weapon to use against President Barack Obama: White House visitor logs. In a Dec. 3, 2009, broadcast, Beck decried that Andy Stern, head of the Service Employees International Union, appears more times in a White House visitor log release than anyone else. "You've got to ask yourself what the hell happened to this country," Beck said. "If I would have told you instead that the most frequent visitor of the White House, over the secretary of state and everybody else, is a labor union president [Stern] who has repeatedly said workers of the world unite ... would you have believed it?" (For the record, "Workers of the world, unite!" is the popular, if unofficial, translation of the final exhortation in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' Communist Manifesto .) We found the source of Beck's claim. When the White House released its first batch of visitor logs on Oct. 30, 2009, as part of a pledge to bring more transparency to the White House, Stern's name did indeed appear 22 times, more than anyone else listed, including Clinton, who was listed three times. But that's not the whole story. Stern led the pack for the first data release, which covered visits from Jan. 20, 2009 to July 31, 2009. But he was surpassed by several other individuals in the second release, which updates the data through Aug. 31, 2009 (and which was made public more than a week before Beck aired his comment). Among those who visited more frequently than Stern, according to the combination of the two logs, were Lewis (Lee) Sachs, counselor to Treasury Secetary Timothy Geithner, with 92 visits; associate attorney general Tom Perrelli, with 49; Federal Communications Commission chairman Julius Genachowski with 47; Spencer Overton, principal deputy assistant attorney general, with 38; and Health and Human Services office of health reform director Jeanne Lambrew, with 27. (Stern visited twice more during the period covered by the second batch of data, giving him a total of 24 visits.) Another complication is that the first batch of data -- covering the period from Jan. 20, 2009, to July 31, 2009, which found Stern in the lead -- is not a complete accounting of White House visits during that period. It only includes data for visitors whose names were first requested by the public. If no one requested a specific name, that name would not appear in the database. So there's no way of knowing whether Stern actually had the most visits for that period; he simply had the most of anyone whose name was requested by the public. (All records dated after Sept. 15, 2009, will be released, the White House says, with exceptions for issues of national security, personal safety and a few other caveats.) Finally, there are a lot of important people whose visits are not ordinarily captured by the White House log system -- most notably, Cabinet members, like the one Beck mentioned, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. While the visitor logs show a mere three visits by Clinton, we were able to confirm at least 26 separate White House visits by the secretary of state by using three public Web sites -- the White House's own site, the White House Flickr site and the State Department's site. Our sources column at the right includes the full list of Clinton's 26 visits, with links to the documentation. Since the White House has said that it cannot fulfill our request for a full listing of Clinton's White House visits, it's possible that the number of Clinton visits is actually higher. (And we have not included instances in which Clinton met with the president in locations away from the White House itself, such as flights aboard Air Force One and foreign travel, even though we found evidence documenting those sorts of visits as well.) So, while Beck did pass along a widely reported finding as he made his point about Stern, the data it was based on was incomplete and out of date by the time of his show, and ultimately the conclusion he drew was incorrect. We rate his statement False.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2009-12-07T18:22:26	2009-12-03	['Andy_Stern', 'White_House']
pomt-13466	Nevada Republican Senate nominee "Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims."	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/sep/13/planned-parenthood-votes/planned-parenthood-votes-says-joe-heck-voted-crimi/	An affiliate of Planned Parenthood has released an ad targeting Rep. Joe Heck, the Republican nominee in the neck-and-neck U.S. Senate race in Nevada. Accompanying a series of black-and-white images of women, a narrator says, "It’s terrible, but it’s true. Joe Heck voted eight times to defund Planned Parenthood and would criminalize abortion for rape victims, because he’s a Washington politician before he’s a Nevada physician. And Planned Parenthood wants you to know that Joe Heck is dangerous to your health." Heck is running against Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto in the open-seat race to succeed retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. We took a closer look at the part about criminalizing abortion, which was punctuated with text on the screen saying, "Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims." (We've already looked at Heck's record on voting to defund Planned Parenthood.) The idea of criminally punishing women for having an abortion has already come up in the 2016 campaign, as we’ve noted before -- and when it did, Republicans quickly backed off it. In an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews on March 30, 2016, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said women should be punished for having an abortion, but he quickly backtracked after an outcry, releasing a statement on his campaign website later that day. We found that there’s some truth behind the ad’s charge, but the Planned Parenthood Votes ad overplays its hand. In small type on screen, the ad cites media coverage of a 2012 bill that Heck co-sponsored and voted for -- the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. (Planned Parenthood Votes confirmed in interviews that this was the legislation the ad was based on.) On July 31, 2012, the bill secured 220 yea votes and 154 nay votes in the Republican-controlled House. While that was a majority of the chamber, it did not pass because it did not reach the two-thirds minimum required for that type of vote. According to the bill summary, the measure would have amended the federal criminal code to "prohibit any person from performing or attempting to perform an abortion" after 20 weeks within the District of Columbia "except in conformity with this act's requirements." The exceptions, according to the bill text, would be risk of "the death of the pregnant woman; or ... the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including psychological or emotional conditions, of the pregnant woman." In other words, pregnancy through rape would not qualify for an exception under the bill. And the possible penalty could include a fine and up to two years in prison. But a key question is: A penalty for who? The answer is that the criminal risk would fall upon the doctor. In fact, the legislation includes language that specifically protects the woman getting the abortion from being prosecuted: "A woman upon whom an abortion in violation of (this legislation) is performed or attempted may not be prosecuted under, or for a conspiracy to violate" the measure. However, the Planned Parenthood ad fuzzes the difference between prosecuting the abortion provider and prosecuting the woman receiving the abortion. The use of "for" in the sentence "Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims" could be interpreted to mean that rape victims would bear the legal consequences, even though the law makes clear that they would not. In fact, the ad visually reinforces the notion that women would be left open to criminal penalties by featuring a succession of young women, none of whom wear the tools of the medical profession, such as a lab coat or a stethoscope. Planned Parenthood Votes said that even without criminal penalties for women, the bill would have had severe consequences for them, effectively making it impossible for rape victims to receive an abortion after 20 weeks. "Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion," said Erica Sackin, communications director for Planned Parenthood Votes. "Whether the law sends women to jail or doctors to jail, the end result is the same: Women would have been left with nowhere to turn to for safe, legal abortion." Our ruling The Planned Parenthood Votes ad said that "Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims." The group has a point that a bill Heck voted for and co-sponsored would have criminalized medical professionals from performing abortions after 20 weeks for rape victims who are not at risk of death or significant physical health complications due to pregnancy, at least in Washington, D.C. This would have eliminated all legal abortions for women in that category. However, the ad blurs the issue of whether medical professionals or the women themselves would be at risk of prosecution. Only medical professionals would face legal consequences under the bill, but the ad’s imagery implies otherwise, using only women as visuals. On balance, we rate the ad Half True.

pomt-00039	Says Tony Thurmond was "sued by the ACLU" for leaving students in unsafe conditions.	false	/california/statements/2018/nov/05/students-parents-and-teachers-supporting-marshall-/false-attack-ads-claim-tony-thurmond-was-sued-aclu/	Was candidate for California schools chief Tony Thurmond "sued by the ACLU"? That's one of the attention-grabbing claims in a recent TV attack ad and campaign mailer by a group supporting Marshall Tuck, Thurmond’s opponent in the race. The two Democrats are running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Thurmond is a state assemblyman who represents Richmond, Berkeley and other East Bay communities and is supported by teacher unions. Tuck is a former education executive backed by charter school groups. The incumbent, Tom Torlakson, will be termed out in January after serving two four-year terms. Several recent attack ads by each side, funded by tens of millions of campaign contributions, have turned the typically under-the-radar race into a hotly-contested one. We wanted to know whether there was evidence to support the claim Thurmond was "sued by the ACLU." Our research Before he was elected to the state Legislature, Thurmond was a board member for the West Contra Costa Unified School District, based in Richmond, from 2008 to 2012. The TV attack ad and its claim about the lawsuit refer to this period of Thurmond’s career. Here’s the full version of the ad: "Before he was running for State Superintendent, politician Tony Thurmond was responsible for a school district with widespread budget problems. Ranked last in the state for failing to serve students of color. Sued for leaving at-risk students in rotting trailers with mushrooms growing in the floors. Reprimanded by the Obama Administration for failing to address widespread sexual harassment and assault in district schools. Tony Thurmond failed the students he was supposed to help. California deserves better."Marshall Tuck-supporting PAC ad targeting Tony Thurmond, 2018 from EdSource on Vimeo. The ad was produced by Students, Parents and Teachers supporting Marshall Tuck, an independent expenditure group created by EdVoice, a nonprofit that supports charter schools. During the voiceover, the ad uses large text that reads: "TONY THURMOND: Sued by the ACLU" to relay this claim, blurring the line between Thurmond and the school district. The campaign mailer is even less subtle, using bold block letters reading: ACLU. WHY DID THE ACLU FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST TONY THURMOND? We agreed with analysis from EdSource, a nonprofit education news group, on this misleading nature of this claim: "The ad’s statement that Thurmond was sued over school facilities is technically accurate, in that he was named as a defendant board member in an American Civil Liberties Union’s lawsuit against West Contra Costa Unified. However, the lawsuit named every member of the school board, along with the district, its superintendent and its associate superintendent. The district’s daily management falls to its administration, not the elected board members." Singling out Thurmond for the problems cited in the June 2012 lawsuit gives the wrong impression. He served on the board during the period cited in the suit, but was not directly responsible for the conditions. Abdi Soltani, executive director of the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, wrote in a letter to EdVoice that the foundation, not the national ACLU, filed the lawsuit. Soltani added that the foundation had nothing to do with the campaign mailer and doesn’t endorse candidates. A spokeswoman for EdVoice pointed us to a website created by the independent expenditure group backing Tuck. It repeats the same claims as the TV ad and includes a link to the lawsuit. But it doesn’t connect Thurmond directly to any of the unsafe conditions. When we asked Thurmond’s campaign about the TV spot and mailer, it pointed to groups and individuals from the NAACP to U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who have all called out the claims. In a related fact check, we rated False the claim Thurmond was "reprimanded" by the Obama administration Our ruling A recent TV spot and campaign mailer by a group supporting Marshall Tuck claimed Tony Thurmond was "sued by the ACLU." In reality, ACLU Foundation of Northern California filed a lawsuit in 2012 against the West Contra Costa Unified School District over unsafe school conditions. All five members of the district’s board, including Thurmond, were named in the lawsuit, along with the district’s administrators. The lawsuit, however, doesn’t directly tie Thurmond to any of the school conditions, which are managed daily by administrators, not board members. By focusing on Thurmond only, the campaign mailer and the text of the TV ad distort the facts, giving the wrong impression he was the sole target of the lawsuit and uniquely responsible.

pomt-08622	The new health care law "will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/20/60-plus-association/medicare-cuts-health-care-law-will-hurt-seniors-sa/	Guess which member of Congress "betrayed" seniors by voting in favor of the 2010 health care law, a vote for "Nancy Pelosi's health care bill which will cut $500 billion from Medicare" and "hurt the quality of our care." Which member is it? Well, lots of them, according to the 60 Plus Association. The advocacy group bills itself as "a conservative alternative to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)" and supports" a free-enterprise, less -government, less-taxes approach to seniors issues." It has created substantially similar ads to run against Democratic members of Congress in districts around the country. In Florida, the group is targeting Rep. Allen Boyd, who represents the Panhandle area, and Reps. Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas, both from central Florida. It is also running ads against Wisconsin members Steve Kagen, representing Green Bay and Appleton, and Ron Kind of western Wisconsin. Another target is John Boccieri of Canton, Ohio. Still other ads target House members from Arizona, New York, Indiana and Pennsylvania. It's true that all of these members of Congress voted in favor of the new health care law when it came up for a vote on March 21, 2010. But the ad gives a highly misleading impression about funding for Medicare. Here's the text of the ad running against Boyd, the Florida congressman who represents the northwest Panhandle area: "Alan Boyd has betrayed Florida's seniors. Instead of voting to protect us, he supported Nancy Pelosi's liberal agenda. Boyd voted for Nancy Pelosi's health care bill which will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care. ... Florida's seniors can send Alan Boyd a message. He betrayed us, and this November, we'll remember." Because of our previous fact-checks on the health care law, we knew this ad was leaving out important details on how the health care law, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, changed Medicare. Medicare, a government-run health insurance program, provides health care coverage for the vast majority of Americans over age 65. It accounts for about 12 percent of the federal budget. It's important to note that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase -- the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. Next, we wanted to address how those reductions are expected to affect the quality of care. "Some (changes) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage," said Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. "Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care." Neuman walked through the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website, a good non-ideological explanation for people interested in changes to Medicare under health care reform. Some of the savings are for relatively minor programs, such as $36 billion for increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion for administrative changes. The law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. More significantly, there's also $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. Let's back-up for a minute and explain Medicare Advantage: There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plans), which are run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage programs typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100. The Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more efficiency from the private sector to the Medicare program, but it hasn't worked as planned. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said that the Advantage programs costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use. The health care law that President Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs over the next three to six years to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare and institutes other rules for the program. "How these payment changes will affect beneficiaries remains to be seen -- but is expected to vary across the country," Neuman said. "The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will result in fewer enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans, and fewer extra benefits for Medicare Advantage enrollees, on average. It is also possible that the number of plans available to beneficiaries will decline -- which may or may not be a concern. On average, Medicare beneficiaries have 30 plans available to them in 2010." PolitiFact has waded into this argument about whether the adjustments to the Medicare Advantage option constitute a cut before. Most experts we talked to had the same answer: yes and no. On one hand, they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, experts said. And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. (More on this in a bit.) Still, changes could be in store for Medicare Advantage participants, especially the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage, experts said. But basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same. Finally, there's $220 billion in Medicare savings achieved by reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. The reductions are part of programs intended to improve care and make it more efficient, such as reducing payments for preventable hospital re-admissions. These adjustments are aimed at hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies. The Office of the Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid Services questioned in an April 2010 report whether these levels of savings are realistic, saying that some health care providers would become unprofitable if payments were reduced. (The 60 Plus ad cites this report in its fine print.) The actuary's report suggests that Congress will intervene to change the payment formula to avoid health care providers dropping out of Medicare. The report also includes this caveat about how difficult it is to project the effects of the health care law: "The legislation would result in numerous changes in the way that health care insurance is provided and paid for in the U.S., and the scope and magnitude of these changes are such that few precedents exist for use in estimation. Consequently, the estimates presented here are subject to a substantially greater degree of uncertainty than is usually the case with more routine health care legislation." Finally, the 60 Plus ad also fails to mention new benefits for seniors under the health care law, such as a $250 rebate for prescription drugs purchased through Medicare Part D. (A statement on the 60 Plus website calls the drug rebate "the senior suckup.") Currently, after an initial benefit period, enrollees are required to pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach a level of catastrophic coverage. The rebate is meant to begin to close what is often called the doughnut hole in prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries. By 2020, Medicare will pay 75 percent of the total cost of generic prescription drug coverage in the gap, a marked improvement to the current program. Getting back to the Truth-O-Meter, the 60 Plus ad says that the new health care law "will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care." The ad loses points for accuracy because the $500 billion aren't actual cuts but reductions to future spending for a program that will still grow significantly in the next 10 years. The ad also says those cuts will "hurt the quality" of seniors' care. But we find that to be a highly contentious subject, and the 60 Plus ad doesn't hint at any of the ways that the reductions are ways to make Medicare more efficient. Finally, the ad doesn't mention any of the benefits to seniors, such as improved prescription drug coverage. The ad seems more intent on attacking the health care law than accurately describing this complicated piece of legislation. Because it leaves critical facts out of its description in a way that gives a misleading impression, we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12729	"Just last year, over 5,000 refugees came to New York state, and 94 percent settled outside of New York City."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/mar/04/sean-ryan/heres-where-refugees-settled-new-york-2016/	A group of state lawmakers wants Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to include $12 million for refugee resettlement agencies in the next state budget. Federal funding for those agencies could be at risk if the U.S. places a temporary ban on refugees entering the country. President Donald Trump, in his January executive order on immigration, placed a temporary 120-day suspension on refugees entering the United States as well as a travel ban on seven mostly Muslim countries. That order has been halted by a federal judge. Trump also ordered limiting to 50,000 the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. in 2017. The number allowed into the U.S. was 110,000 under former President Barack Obama. The federal money goes to resettlement agencies when they receive new refugees. That funding could dry up with a refugee ban in place and if fewer refugees are placed in New York state. The state does not provide funding to these agencies. Assemblyman Sean Ryan, D-Buffalo, called the funding especially important for upstate communities, where most refugees are placed. "We know that refugees are a great economic driver in the communities we represent," Ryan said at a press conference. "Just last year, over 5,000 refugees came to New York state, and 94 percent settled outside of New York City." That number does not include the number of immigrants who entered New York last year. Immigrants are typically people who move somewhere by choice to improve their lives while refugees are trying to escape from persecution or armed conflict, like in Syria. Is Ryan right about how many refugees resettled in New York state last year? Federal fiscal year data New York state accepted 5,026 refugees in the federal fiscal year that ran from October 2015 through September 2016, the third most in the country, according to the Department of State. Upstate New York accepted 4,722, or 94 percent, of the refugees. New York City accepted 5.6 percent of them. The few remaining refugees went to Long Island or the New York City suburbs. Thirty-six percent of the refugees went to Erie County. Onondaga County took in the second-highest percentage of refugees, almost 25 percent. Calendar year data Ryan did not say if he was talking about the 2016 federal fiscal year or the 2016 calendar year. The data is typically reported by federal fiscal year. We checked both. During the 2016 calendar year, 5,830 refugees were resettled in New York state. Upstate New York accepted 5,430, or 93 percent, of them. Downstate New York accepted the rest. Erie and Onondaga counties also accepted the most refugees. Erie County took 1,966 of the state’s refugees. Onondaga accepted 1,092 refugees.

pomt-04666	Says "under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/07/cnsnews/oregon-do-15-year-olds-have-complete-control-over-/	In early August, CNSNews.com published an article with the headline "Obamacare Mandate: Sterilize 15-Year-Old Girls for Free –Without Parental Consent." "Thanks to an Obamacare regulation that took effect on Aug. 1," read the article, "health care plans in Oregon will now be required to provide free sterilizations to 15-year-old girls even if the parents of those girls do not consent to the procedure." The article went on to note that "Under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not." The story got picked up by several websites, quickly making its way around the web – and into our mailbox. Of course, we were curious, too, so we got to checking. Before we get to our findings, here's a little context about CNSNews.com for those – like us – who had not heard of it. CNSNews.com, based in a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., says its goal is to "provide an alternative news source that would cover stories that are subject to the bias of omission and report on other news subject to bias by commission." It is not affiliated with Catholic News Service, which sometimes uses the same CNS abbreviation. First, we checked the larger context of the article to see if "Obamacare" (the Affordable Care Act) requires health insurers to cover sterilization. We made several calls before we finally came up with a solid source that confirmed the new law requires providers to cover sterilization without cost to the patient. According to the U.S. Health Resource and Services Administration, services that fall under "women's preventive health care" are supposed to be covered for free, including mammograms, screenings for cervical cancer, prenatal care, contraception, sexually transmitted infection counseling and – yes –"sterilization procedures." As for the more salient detail – the age of consent in Oregon – we found a piece of Oregon law, which states that "a minor 15 years of age or older may give consent, without the consent of a parent or guardian of the minor, to: Hospital care, medical or surgical diagnosis or treatment by a physician licensed by the Oregon Medical Board …" Essentially, CNSNews.com linked those two pieces of information – the new requirements that insurance companies cover sterilization for free and the fact that Oregon's age of consent for health care is 15 years old. The idea that 15-year-old girls would be lining up for free on-demand sterilizations struck our readers either as scary - "Is this true?" - or ridiculous - "This can't be true." We kept reporting. We checked whether sterilization had always been covered by the Oregon Health Plan, the state-run health care insurance program that covers 600,000 people a month. We called Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Alissa Robbins, who confirmed that it has been included since the plan's inception in 1994. We also asked how many 15-, 16 – and 17-year-olds had received sterilizations under the plan. Robbins checked records for the last 10 years and found no sterilization procedure for a 15-year-old or a 16-year-old. As for 17-year-olds, she said, at most one such procedure is performed each year, though some years none is performed. She couldn't tell us the reason, she said, because it was "protected health information." However, it seems clear to us that the procedure for young women in that age bracket is exceedingly rare. Robbins also pointed us to ORS 436, which lays out the warnings and consent procedures for anyone seeking sterilization, including minors. If a physician feels a minor is not capable of making an informed consent to be sterilized, her only recourse is to go to court and ask a judge to order that she is. We also checked with OHSU Hospital to see what the process would be for a minor looking to be sterilized there. Spokeswoman Tamara Hargens-Bradley got back to us with a lengthy email. For any patient under 30, she said, the hospital offers counseling about "long-acting reversible contraceptives" and "the risk of regret" in young women who are sterilized. The "most likely scenario in which a teenager would request sterilization," she wrote, "is if she has a medical condition so severe that pregnancy would be life-threatening." If sterilization is not needed medically and a teen insists, Hargens-Bradley said the OHSU ethics committee would get involved. "(T)hat would be very unusual and cause concern about whether the patient is capable of providing fully informed consent." She ended on this note: "The health care reform offering contraception for free does not REQUIRE a physician to provide care they do not feel is safe for the patient. It requires that insurance plans cover all contraceptives available." After some vacation phone tag, we were able to talk to Michael Chapman, the CNSNews.com managing editor who had worked closely with the story's author, an intern who is no longer there. "Our story is factual," Chapman said. "Out story reports what the law is in Oregon and it reports what the federal regulation is." Chapman said the article was stymied in part by little response from the Oregon Health Authority. "It's great they're willing to say more now that the story has come out. "Nearly all health insurers must provide sterilization ... that's a fact." In a subsequent email, Chapman pointed out language on the Oregon Health Authority's consent to sterilization form that reads "I was told that the decision to be sterilized is completely up to me." The form is the last step in many checks and balances that is only signed after the patient finds a physician willing to perform the procedure. Now let's pull this together. Our reporting found that it's true that the health care act requires sterilizations to be free. It's also true that 15-year-olds can consent to health care without parental consent. But CNSNews.com goes even further by alleging that "under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not." The statement would be accurate if it said health care plans in Oregon are required to pay for sterilizations for 15-year-old-girls. But instead, the statement confuses the insurers with providers – i.e. physicians – stating that 15-year-olds have "complete control." That's not true. What a 15-year-old girl may want and what a medical provider is willing to do, at least in this case, are two very different things. Health care providers are under no obligation to provide sterilization on demand. In fact, free sterilization is not available on demand for 15-year-olds in Oregon. A 15-year-old must first convince a doctor that the procedure is medically necessary. While sometimes it is -- to treat cancer, for instance --a decade of records from the Oregon Health Plan and the explanation of procedures at OHSU show sterilization of 15-year-olds is incredibly rare. In Oregon, 15-year-old girls do not have "complete control" over whether to be sterilized. We rule the statement False.	None	CNSNews	None	None	None	2012-09-07T16:13:29	2012-08-10	['Oregon']
pomt-01171	University of Texas students "signed a petition seeking the legal right to abort newborn babies up to five-years-old."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/dec/10/texas-right-life/texas-right-life-says-ut-students-signed-petition-/	An anti-abortion group soliciting contributions to bolster its presence on Texas college campuses drew our attention by associating University of Texas students with legalizing child murder. A Dec. 5, 2014, "Murder: urgent" email blast from Jim Graham, executive director of Texas Right to Life, opened: "I received word that students at the University of Texas in Austin signed a petition seeking the legal right to abort newborn babies up to five-years-old. You read that correctly. You and I call it murder and infanticide. As ridiculous as this petition sounds, I do not take it lightly, and I know you don't either." For real? Video basis of claim To our request for detail, a group spokeswoman, Melissa Conway, emailed us a link to a video posted on YouTube by InfoWars.com, the reporting project shepherded by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. In the video, a sports-jacketed man in shades seemingly draws UT students to sign just such a petition. An unsigned version appears on screen, stating: "Please support the Post-Birth Abortion Act of 2014. This is to emphasize that the moral status of the newborn baby is comparable with that of a fetus … rather than that of a child. Therefore, we claim that killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all the circumstances where abortion would be. This post-birth abortion can take place until a newborn is self aware or reaches 5 years old. This act is supported by numerous scientists and medical doctors as a safe and effective way to preserve the quality of life." The man shown collecting the signatures, Joe Biggs of InfoWars.com, says on camera he’s "here at the University of Texas in Austin," then says there’s a trend going around U.S. college campuses of talking up post-birth abortions. "It’s all the new rage," he says. The video flashes part of a student-written story posted online Oct. 29, 2014, headlined "Trending: More college students support post-birth abortion," quoting an activist saying support for infanticide or child killings had been noted from students at Purdue, the University of Minnesota and the University of Central Florida. (On Oct. 30, 2014, the debunkists at Snopes.com acted on the same story, finding False the idea that a "growing number of college students support ‘post-birth abortions,’ extending to children as old as four or five.") In the video, Biggs says a lot of college students around the country "agree with killing babies up to the age of four or five. So I came out here today to find out whether or not UT agrees with post-birth abortions." All told, the video shows Biggs talking to 16 students about the petition; 12 sign, it appears, three decline and it’s unclear what one man decides. By our sights, not everyone is paying attention. At least two students act while wearing headphones, two sign while talking on phones and another signs while holding a plate of food in her other hand. "The more the merrier," Biggs says to one student, "the more we can help empower women." He tells another the proposal is to "give women the right to have abortions." If an abortion is botched, Biggs says, and the baby is born, "it gives the mother the opportunity to continue on with it," meaning the abortion. A woman refusing to sign tells Biggs: "I’m not doing that. That’s freaking ridiculous." Petitioner: About 30 students approached To our inquiry, Biggs said by phone he collected the signatures on the campus at midday Oct. 29. Biggs said he showed the petition to about 30 students -- meaning around 17 declined to sign, he agreed. "Some people walked by me" and said "this is crazy, you’re out of your mind," Biggs said. Student comments At our request, Biggs emailed us a page listing 13 names and signatures, enabling us to identify the purported signers and try to reach them. We heard back by email from three students who confirmed signing the petition, each one expressing surprise at what she or he had endorsed: --Danielle Bainter said she signed the petition in a rush to class after the presenter misrepresented its purpose. "Had I fully understood the actual position the organizer was advancing, there is absolutely no way that I ever would have signed his petition. To be clear, I unequivocally do not support" such an act, she wrote. "To me, the stated purpose is so horrifying and revolting that I find it difficult to imagine that such a petition or related act could be advanced for anything more than a political stunt." She said she wouldn’t make the mistake again. --Milla Lubis said she signed the petition after "the man petitioning led me to believe it was about keeping a women's health clinic open. After reading what was printed on the petition I realized this was not the case but I felt obligated to sign," Lubis said, "because I had already been handed the petition." Lubis, saying she doesn’t support post-birth killings, said "it's misleading to have someone stand in the middle of campus asking women if they believe in women's rights." --Joseph Ellerd said he "was given different information about the petition’s platform at the time by a guy on the sidewalk. It wasn't the same info you're giving me." Asked his opinion, Eller said that if "the child's already born, then aborting the child is kind of wrong. So I'm not in favor of the petition if it means a mother can abort a child any time before the age of five." By phone, Stephanie Forsberg said she signed the petition and does support the concept, for "complicated" reasons. Our ruling The group said UT students "signed a petition seeking the legal right to abort newborn babies up to five-years-old." Some university students signed the petition, but others did not. Some of those who did sign later said they did not support the concept advocated by the petition. Further, Texas Right to Life's email struck us as implying that students on the campus were hustling up support for legalizing infanticide and child killings. In reality, a visitor briefly collected signatures one day, almost like attempting a trick. So, this statement is partially accurate but lacks important context. That makes it Half True.

pomt-08311	Democratic U.S. House candidate Julie Lassa pushed for a "Canadian-style government takeover of health care."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/30/national-republican-congressional-committee/republican-group-says-julie-lassa-pushed-canadian-/	In the 2010 campaign, many national Democrats have been forced to defend their votes for health care reform. In Wisconsin, the same is true of state-level Democrats, including state Sen. Julie Lassa, who is running for the U.S. House. At issue: A 2007 vote by state Senate Democrats to include "Healthy Wisconsin," a state-level universal health care program, in their version of the budget. Lassa voted for the package -- and that vote became key part of a TV ad aired by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Lassa is facing Republican Sean Duffy in a bid for the northwest Wisconsin seat held since 1969 by retiring Democrat Dave Obey. In the TV ad, the GOP lists a litany of complaints about Lassa’s record, including the fact she pushed for a "Canadian-style government takeover of health care." It even labels the plan "LassaCare." There’s no question about the vote. But what about the "Canadian-style takeover" part? We turned to several experts. They said the Canadian health system — praised by some, but treated as an expletive of sorts in the ad — includes these key aspects: Canada has universal health insurance, meaning everyone is covered. It is a single payer system, meaning the government pays the bills. Each province negotiates rates and coverage with doctors, hospitals and caregivers. The system is funded through income taxes. No private insurance is allowed. Now let’s take a look at the Healthy Wisconsin plan, which went nowhere. The Assembly was controlled by Republicans at the time, and even Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle did not sign on. The plan was an effort to provide health insurance to all eligible Wisconsin residents, so it matches Canada as universal coverage. But it was paid for through a payroll tax on both employers and workers -- not an income tax. What’s more, a variety of private insurance plans would have been offered to state residents. The plan would have resembled the health insurance benefits provided for state employees. "It’s not a single payer plan in any respect," said Thomas R. Oliver, a University of Wisconsin-Madison health policy professor. "The idea was that a number of plans would be available for individuals." Others agreed. "This is not Canadian-style health care at all," said Susan Giaimo, a visiting assistant professor of political science at Marquette University who wrote a paper about Healthy Wisconsin, and a book on health care systems in Germany and the United Kingdom. "Individuals, not employers, would choose their health plan from among a range of plans," she said, adding private insurance plans would have continued, with regulation by the state. David R. Riemer, an architect of the Healthy Wisconsin plan, told PolitiFact Wisconsin the key difference was who pays the bills. In Canada, the government pays. With Healthy Wisconsin, insurance companies would have paid. At the time Healthy Wisconsin was being debated, there was sharp disagreement about how far-reaching the proposal was. A report by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative-leaning group, declared: "Healthy Wisconsin would turn every aspect of the health care system over to state government." The report noted "cost containment" was an aspect of the plan, and said other countries with a single-payer system have rationed the use of "high-cost new technology." In testimony before a state Senate committee, Michael Tanner, an official with the Cato Institute, a libertarian group, said the plan "combines many aspects of a single-payer health care system with the central structure of a concept known as ‘managed competition.’ " This, he said, would almost inevitably reduce the availability of and access to care, and lead to a reduction in capital spending on health care. Both opponents used problems with the Canadian system to warn against the perils of government involvement in health care. But they did not say Healthy Wisconsin resembled a move to that country’s system of health care. So, let’s return to the GOP claim against Lassa. Did Lassa and Senate Democrats push a plan that a Canadian would recognize? Hardly. The differences are many: Who pays, how the plan is funded, insurance choices for consumers. Broad strokes are often used in political attacks, and in some cases those making them paint outside the lines. In this case, the lines got painted over. We rate the claim False.

pomt-11394	"States that have implemented waiting periods have seen significant decreases in suicides."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/24/doug-jones/yes-waiting-periods-gun-purchases-have-been-linked/	In his first speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., waded into the nation’s fraught debate over gun violence. Jones, who defeated Roy Moore in Alabama’s December 2017 special Senate election, voiced support for steps to reduce the rate of gun-related deaths in America, including a federal measure to impose mandatory waiting periods on the purchase of firearms. "States that have implemented waiting periods have seen significant decreases in suicides," Jones said in a March 21 speech that sought to balance Second Amendment rights with gun control measures. Suicides accounted for just over 60 percent of the United States’ roughly 36,000 gun-related deaths in 2015, according to the most recent available government data. We decided to take a closer look at the research into waiting periods and suicide reduction. Brady Law study A waiting period is a mandatory delay that requires gun purchasers to wait — typically between two and seven days — before obtaining their weapons. Nine states and the District of Columbia have laws that require a waiting period for purchases of at least some types of guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. There is currently no federal waiting period for gun sales. Congress previously established a nationwide waiting period and background check for handgun sales through the 1994 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The federal wait period was in effect for just under 5 years before the provision expired. Jones’ office pointed us to a 2000 study that looked at the effect of the Brady Law on gun violence and suicide. That study found waiting periods were associated with reductions in the firearm suicide rate for people age 55 and older. However, waiting periods were not linked to lower suicide rates overall, which suggests some opted for alternative means of suicide. Handgun waiting periods study We reached out to Philip Cook, one of the authors of the Brady Law study, who pointed us to more recent research focused on waiting times and gun violence. One gun control expert told us the 2017 study, "Handgun waiting periods reduce gun deaths," represented the best research on the relationship between waiting periods and suicides. (Note: Cook is listed as the study's editor.) Researchers studied every change to waiting period laws in the United States from 1970 and 2014, and compared the laws with changes in the government’s annual data on gun-related deaths. (Forty-three states plus the District of Columbia had a waiting period for at least some time between 1970 and 2014; researchers also looked at the federal Brady Law.) The study noted that delaying the purchase of a gun could create a "cooling off" period to allow a "visceral state" — including suicidal impulses — to subside before the gun buyer took possession of a firearm. Michael Luca, a professor at Harvard Business School and one of the study’s authors, pointed us to the key passage for purposes of checking Jones’ claim: "Waiting periods lead to a 7–11 percent reduction in gun suicides (depending on the control variables used in the specification), which is equivalent to 22–35 fewer gun suicides per year for the average state." "Jones is on solid ground here," Luca said. Daniel W. Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, described the study by Luca and his colleagues as "the best research I can point to on the effects of waiting periods for gun purchases." However, David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute and author of several books on gun control, said the study "has somewhat less certitude than Sen. Jones suggests." He noted the findings’ statistical significance depended on which model was used. In an October 2017 CNN article, Deepak Malhotra, a professor of negotiation and conflict resolution at Harvard Business School and Luca’s co-author, was somewhat measured when describing the study’s conclusions on suicide reduction. "There seems to be a lot of evidence to suggest that suicides also are reduced, but further research might be necessary on that issue," Malhotra said. (We reached out to Malhotra but did not hear back.) Our ruling Jones said, "States that have implemented waiting periods have seen significant decreases in suicides." A 2017 study on the relationship between waiting periods and suicides — which was cited by some foremost gun control experts — found waiting periods led to a 7–11 percent reduction in gun suicides. That’s the equivalent of 22–35 fewer gun suicides per year for the average state. That said, one expert said the statistical significance of the study’s findings depended on which model was used, and one of the study’s coathors was somewhat measured in describing the study’s conclusions with respect to the effect of waiting periods on suicide reduction.

pomt-11648	Says the Obama administration "sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London ... only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/12/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-faults-obama-london-embassy-move/	President Donald Trump isn’t going to London any time soon. Planning was under way for a February visit, when it was thought Trump would officially open the new U.S. embassy in London. Trump scuttled those plans in no uncertain terms. "Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for ‘peanuts,’ only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars," Trump tweeted Jan. 11. "Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Whether the new embassy is in a good or bad location is matter of opinion. But Trump was off the mark in putting this deal on the shoulders of the Obama administration. The wheels started turning early in the second term of President George W. Bush, and the deal on a new location was announced Oct. 2, 2008, before Bush left office. A push for embassy security With an eye on thwarting terrorist attacks, the State Department’s Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations under Bush aimed to harden America’s diplomatic facilities. The embassy in London dated from 1960 and in 2006, the bureau estimated that it would take $550 million and seven years to improve it, and even then it would not meet security needs. In October 2008, then-Ambassador Robert Tuttle, who led the search for a new site, announced the move to a site on the other side of the Thames River from the old location. "We looked at all our options, including renovation of our current building on Grosvenor Square," Tuttle said. "In the end, we realized that the goal of a modern, secure and environmentally sustainable embassy could best be met by constructing a new facility." The State Department announced that the United States had signed a preliminary contract for the new location, contingent on the sale of the existing chancery. The budget The project had a budget of $1.02 billion. When the plan was announced, officials said the entire cost would be financed by the sale of three State Department properties in London -- the Navy Annex, the existing chancery, and the Marine Security Guard quarters. In 2015, the head of the State Department’s bureau, Lydia Muniz, told lawmakers the building was on time and on budget. Money from the sale of the old embassy (technically, the sale of the 999-year lease the United States held on the property) came in August 2013, during the Obama administration. The final terms were not public, but a BBC report estimated the value at somewhere between £300 million and £500 million, or about $400 million to $680 million. A Qatari real estate group bought the lease with plans to turn the property into a hotel. Our ruling Trump said Obama sold the otherwise fine American embassy in London and relocated at a cost of $1.2 billion. Actually, the Bush administration put the plan in place after concluding that the existing embassy could not meet security requirements. The cost was about $200 million less than Trump said, $1.02 billion rather than $1.2 billion, and was financed through the sale of the old embassy and two other State Department properties in London. While he is correct that the sale occurred on Obama’s watch, the wheels were turning and preliminary contracts had been signed earlier. Trump’s tweet blows past those key details.

pomt-10398	Obama said he would "stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/10/chain-email/not-muslims-but-arab-americans/	A chain e-mail going around takes statements out of context from Sen. Barack Obama's books Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope . The e-mail was sent to us by 20 PolitiFact readers who said they wanted to know if the claims were true. (For more on the e-mail and a link to its full text, read our article on Obama's book .) The e-mails states, "From The Audacity of Hope: 'I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.' " The quote comes from page 261 of the paperback edition of The Audacity of Hope. In the full passage, Obama talks about speaking in front of audiences of immigrants, and how he often tells them that they embody the American dream. But he wrote that when he speaks to audiences of Pakistani and Arab-Americans, their message to him has a more urgent quality. "(T)he stories of detentions and FBI questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging. They have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly; they need specific assurances that their citizenship really means something, that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II, and that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction." Obama doesn't mention Muslims here at all; he's clearly talking about U.S. citizens of Arab and Pakistani descent. Also, the e-mail says Obama would "stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction," implying he made a statement to that effect. But it's clear in reading the text that the words actually represent a question Obama is being asked by his audiences: "they need specific assurances ... that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction." Though Obama doesn't say so explicitly, he gives the impression his answer is yes. The e-mail distorts Obama's quote and misrepresents who he was talking about, lumping together an entire religion when he was talking to two groups of people in the context of discrimination. It's a significant alteration to the meaning of what Obama said, and we find it to be False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-06-10T00:00:00	2008-05-19	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-06894	Says Democratic recall opponent Shelly Moore "opposes any limit on taxes."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/27/sheila-harsdorf/state-senator-sheila-harsdorf-says-recall-election/	Don’t confuse Shelly with Sheila in the recall election that could be key in deciding which party controls the Wisconsin state Senate. That’s the commercial message brought to you by state Sen. Sheila Harsdorf, the River Falls Republican fighting to keep her job in August 2011 -- along with seven other senators. In one of several radio ads, Harsdorf paints herself as a courageous fighter against special interests and a backer of smaller government who "understands that government should serve taxpayers, not the other way around." "That’s what sets Sheila apart from her opponent, union activist Shelly Moore," the "Serving Taxpayers" ad continues. "Moore opposes any limit on taxes. This summer let’s tell Shelly Moore we can’t afford more taxes." Harsdorf voted for Gov. Scott Walker’s budget, which included a municipal property-tax freeze and tight limits on the ability of school districts to raise property taxes. She has been labeling Shelly Moore -- who has campaigned against the GOP-backed budget -- a tax-and-spend liberal. But Harsdorf’s claim that Moore -- her opponent in the Aug. 9 recall election -- stands against all tax limits is a broader line of attack. So we decided to take a look. When we asked Harsdorf to back her claim, her campaign made it clear it is using Moore’s union leader background as a basis for the attack. A high-school English and drama teacher, Moore was president or vice-president of her local union in Ellsworth from 1999 to 2004. She was also deeply involved in statewide politics as early as 2001 with the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the powerful state teachers union. Moore says she served from 2001-2003 on the WEAC committee that recommends lobbying positions for the organization. From 2003 until May 2011 she was on WEAC’s state board. Harsdorf points to Moore’s activism in WEAC and to WEAC’s opposition to three major efforts to rein in taxes since 2003: Constitutional tax-and-spending limits known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, or TABOR, in 2004. Longstanding revenue limits on schools. Property-tax freeze plans in the mid-2000s and in Gov. Scott Walker’s 2011-13 state budget. Harsdorf says that as a union leader, voting board member and member of WEAC’s legislative committee, Moore supported the union’s positions. Harsdorf also released an email from Moore -- written as a constituent to her senator -- that sheds some light on what Moore has said in her own words on revenue limits and TABOR. Let’s examine the evidence: The records show Harsdorf’s office received anti-TABOR contacts both from Moore personally and from Moore on behalf of WEAC. Moore also wrote to Harsdorf regarding the longstanding revenue caps on schools. In January 2005, Moore told Harsdorf those caps on schools "DO NOT WORK." Schools took budget cuts, she wrote, and are "desperate" and "dying." Moore has not disputed the authenticity of the documents. But Moore told us she shouldn’t be held to every WEAC position just because she was on the board. She described herself as moderate, a characterization Harsdorf disputes. But in an interview, Moore didn’t cite any area of disagreement with the union on tax limits -- and that’s the subject of the radio ad. Asked about the three big anti-tax proposals cited by Harsdorf, Moore was critical of the longstanding revenue caps on schools. She said they disproportionately affected fiscally responsible districts. She questioned the effectiveness of property-tax freezes, saying governments will find other ways to identify needed revenue, such as using fees. As for TABOR, she said legislators were eyeing the Colorado model, which she described as ineffective and detrimental to critical services. So just what is Moore’s position on taxes and limits to them? Moore pointed to her opposition to two particular tax increases in Walker’s budget, citing it as evidence that she does support a limit on some taxes. Moore was talking about Walker’s actions on tax credits that limit or eliminate the income-tax liability of low-income homeowners, renters and working families. The budget reduced those tax credits (earned income credit and the Homestead credit) by about $69.8 million over two years. Moore says she wants Wisconsin to get away from tax shifting, but has "no interest" in raising taxes on anyone. She said she is concerned tax burdens are tilted toward the average person and away from corporations. She opposed the corporate tax breaks Walker put in the budget. Moore also claims the budget cut $1.6 billion in funding from local schools. We fact-checked that number, used by Rep. Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, and gave it a Barely True because it was based on a Democratic plan in 2009 to ease up on limits that dictate how much schools can raise in property taxes in 2011-13. Let’s review. In a radio ad, Harsdorf contrasts her vote for a budget with a property-tax freeze with the record of her opponent, saying "Moore opposes any limit on taxes." This is one of those cases where a candidate has some facts on her side but overplays the hand. Moore has objected to several high-profile tax restraint efforts over the years, either personally and/or in her role as a union leader. But Harsdorf does not limit her statement to those measures -- she makes a leap with language that states Moore opposes any tax limits, period. During the campaign, Moore has publicly supported limiting the income-tax liability of working families, the elderly and others. In the past, we’d have called the statement Barely True, but the Truth-O-Meter becomes a little easier to read today as the PolitiFact network has a new title for the old definition: Mostly False. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04873	"Thousands of politicians from across Ohio – along with their relatives, employees and friends – are still eligible to serve" on the proposed redistricting commission.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/09/protect-your-vote-ohio-protect-your-vote-ohio/opponents-ohio-redistricting-issue-say-politicians/	People, not politicians. That’s the campaign slogan of Voters First Ohio, the union-backed group behind the Nov. 6 ballot measure to establish a new "citizens commission" to draw Ohio’s congressional and legislative districts – a task, under current law, assigned to elected officials. The current system is rigged, according to Voters First, because politicians in charge of drawing the lines are motivated only by political gain. The results are gerrymandered districts designed to corral voters who support the party that controls the redistricting process. Last year, for example, majority Republicans established boundaries that favored them, giving them an edge come election-time. But opponents of the ballot measure say the proposed solution – and Voters First’s campaign message – is misleading because it doesn’t really remove politicians from the process. "The proponents are not being straightforward when they promote their scheme," a spokesman for the opposition group Protect Your Vote Ohio said in an Aug. 1 press release. "Thousands of politicians from across Ohio – along with their relatives, employees and friends – are still eligible to serve." This statement raised PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity. Would the new system remove politicians from the redistricting process? First, we looked at a summary of the proposed constitutional amendment that was filed with the Ohio attorney general’s office. The summary, which Attorney General Mike DeWine ruled is an accurate reflection of the amendment, describes the new commission that would oversee the map-drawing process. The 12-member commission would be responsible for approving new maps that outline Ohio’s legislative and congressional districts. The commission would adopt a plan based on four criteria – keeping communities whole, achieving competitiveness, maintaining compactness and having districts with leanings reflecting how Ohioans actually have voted. Before we delve into the commission’s makeup and whether politicians are allowed, let’s summarize the current redistricting process. State lawmakers have the job of drawing the boundaries for Ohio’s 16 congressional districts. When one party controls both the House and the Senate – as the GOP does now – the minority party has little to no say in how the lines are drawn. Last year, taking cues from a top aide to U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, GOP lawmakers approved a map that favors Republican candidates in 12 of the 16 districts. The state apportionment board approves the map of Ohio’s legislative districts. The board is composed of the governor, state auditor, secretary of state and two lawmakers from opposite parties. Republicans also controlled this board last year because they occupied all the statewide offices on the board. There is no question politicians control the current redistricting process. But what about the new, proposed process? It turns out politicians can serve on that commission too – powerful ones, even. The proposed amendment includes a long list of people ineligible to serve on the commission, including state and federal elected officials, their family members, well-heeled campaign donors, lobbyists, political consultants and others. But local elected officials and their family members could still serve on the commission. That means the Cuyahoga County executive, Cleveland’s mayor or any other local politician would be eligible for the citizens commission created by the Voters First proposal. However, the commission wouldn’t be dominated by one party. The amendment calls for the panel to be split equally among Democrats, Republicans and independents or third-party members. Voters First chairwoman Catherine Turcer acknowledged that local elected officials could serve on the commission. A local elected official, however, could be barred from the commission based on other exclusions, such as being a political party official. "It seemed too broad to eliminate every mayor," Turcer said. "It seemed unfair to say none of the local folks could somehow participate." Turcer later said in an email: "Voters First has repeatedly stated that we are talking about politicians who rig the system to protect themselves and their political cronies. Local elected officials do not draw their own district lines and are not rigging the system. State and federal elected officials or politicians face an inherent conflict of interest when it comes to crafting their own district lines. It makes sense to remove them." However, the potential inclusion of local politicians makes the Voters First campaign slogan, "People, not politicians," ring a little hollow. Protect Your Vote Ohio was correct when it said thousands of politicians would be eligible to serve. Ohio has 88 counties, 1,308 townships, 247 cities and 691 villages, according to census data on the website of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. The state also has hundreds of school boards. Each of these municipalities and boards can have several elected officials each. Still, the amendment would remove the state and federal politicians who up to this point have controlled the process and reaped the benefits. That’s an important point of clarification.

pomt-10807	"One man opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq. One man had the courage to call for change. One man didn't play politics with the truth."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/02/john-mccain/he-told-you-so-/	John McCain is right: He told them so. Although he has been one of the Senate's strongest and most vocal advocates of the war in Iraq, leading recent debates against Democratic bills to set a timetable for withdrawal, McCain has also been one of the Bush adminstration's biggest Republican critics. As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency that would threaten America's mission there. Which, of course, is exactly what has happened. He was also a strident critic of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, telling interviewers that he lacked confidence in Rumsfeld as far back as 2004 — meaty criticism for a top Republican on the Armed Services Committee. "There's not enough (troops), and we are in a very serious situation, in my view, a race against time. We need to spend a whole lot more money to get the services back to the people. We need to get the electricity going, the fuel, the water. And unless we get that done and get it done pretty soon, we could face a very serious situation," McCain told NBC's Meet the Press on Aug. 24, 2003. "Time is not on our side. People in 125-degree heat with no electricity and no fuel are going to become angry in a big hurry. The sophistication of the attacks on U.S. and allied troops have increased. And what we do in the next several months will determine whether we're in a very difficult situation or not, and there's still time, but we've got to act quickly." Despite McCain's contrary position on how the Bush administration has fought the war, however, pollsters say the public never really picked up on the nuance: He has always been seen as a Bush loyalist on the war, which is increasingly unpopular. And that's problematic for his presidential campaign. About the only praise McCain has given the Bush administration on the war followed Bush's decision to send 30,000 more troops to Iraq over the past summer. That may have contributed to the sense that McCain was one of the president's men, experts said. "Six months ago, Republican voters felt that he was in lockstep with the president (on the war) and … he was just going off the edge for the cliff for the president," said Dick Bennett, president of the New Hampshire-based American Research Group. This new ad, which is running in New Hampshire and on his Web site, coupled with the message McCain is taking to campaign stops, is designed to put new emphasis on McCain's differences with an unpopular president over an unpopular war. With it, McCain hopes to turn a neat political trick: Supporting the overall policy, while reminding people that he would have done it differently. As for his claim that just "one man" opposed the strategy in Iraq, that's a bit of a stretch: Independent experts and many congressional Democrats have lavished criticism on the administration's strategy in Iraq. But among his major Republican competitors for the presidential nomination, McCain is right. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has recently suggested that he, too, would take a different route in Iraq than the president, but McCain was clearly there first.

pomt-01720	"I haven’t really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/07/rand-paul/did-rand-paul-propose-cutting-aid-israel/	Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a trip to Iowa in early August, hoping to gain support in the key presidential caucus state. But Paul ended up attracting some controversy. Yahoo! News reported that when Paul was asked whether he thought the United States should phase out aid to Israel, he answered, "I haven’t really proposed that in the past. We’ve never had a legislative proposal to do that. You can mistake my position, but then I’ll answer the question. That has not been a position — a legislative position — we have introduced to phase out or get rid of Israel’s aid. That’s the answer to that question. Israel has always been a strong ally of ours and I appreciate that. I voted just this week to give money — more money — to the Iron Dome, so don’t mischaracterize my position on Israel." (He made his comments in neighboring Omaha, Neb.) A chorus of commentators, relying on comments he made early in his Senate tenure, charged that Paul was rewriting history. For instance, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz tweeted, "Rand Paul has absolutely supported ending US aid to Israel, and he needs to stop trying to rewrite history." So was Paul correct when he said, "I haven’t really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past"? We took a closer look. Back in 2011, when Paul was just settling into the Senate, he proposed a budget that was more fiscally conservative than the proposals offered by his Republican contemporaries. In a bid to cut $500 billion from the federal budget, Paul proposed a spending outline that would have eliminated foreign aid entirely. Paul’s cuts weren’t targeted at Israel specifically, which gets about $3 billion a year from the United States, mostly in military assistance. But by cutting all aid to foreign countries, Paul’s proposal would have zeroed out Israel’s aid. Paul’s 2011 budget proposal wasn’t easy to locate on the Web, but using the Wayback Machine -- an Internet archive -- we were able to find a 65-page budget proposal released by Paul’s office in March 2011. Citing a pattern of squandered and unwise spending on foreign governments, the report offered a straightforward bottom line on foreign aid: "Eliminate all international assistance." His proposal went on to address the situation of Israel specifically, leading off the section with a quote from Stanford University economist Alvin Rabushka: "Free money is the scourge of Israel’s economy. It is the difference between a free, prosperous Israel and a statist, dependent Israel." The section on Israel says this: "While this budget proposal does eliminate foreign aid to Israel, it is not meant to hurt, negate, or single out one of America’s most important allies. This proposal eliminates all foreign aid to all countries. Israel’s ability to conduct foreign policy, regain economic dominance, and support itself without the heavy hand of U.S. interests and policies, will only strengthen the Israeli community. The elimination of all foreign aid, including provisions to Israel, is not necessarily a new idea. In 1996, during an address before the U.S. Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that his nation would eventually wean itself from dependence on U.S. foreign aid. Prominent Israeli politicians and economists alike have called for the end of foreign aid. Among them is economist Amon Gafney, who served as governor of the Bank of Israel from 1970 to 1981. He pointed out that foreign aid has caused Israel to suffer from ―Dutch Disease, a situation in which a generous gift brings short-term benefits but impairs a country’s long-term competitiveness." In the run-up to the release of this budget document, Paul defended his zeroing-out strategy for foreign aid -- and its effect of ending aid for Israel -- in at least three separate interviews. The Wolf Blitzer interview. Paul sat for a Jan. 26, 2011, interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Here’s an excerpt: Blitzer: "You want to end all foreign aid as well, is that right?" Paul: "Yes, and in fact, the other day Reuters did a poll, 71 percent of American people agree with me that when we're short of money, where we can't do the things we need to do in our country, we certainly shouldn't be shipping the money overseas. …" Blitzer: "What about the $2 billion or $3 billion that goes every year to Israel? Do you want to eliminate that as well?" Paul: "Well, I think what you have to do is you have to look. When you send foreign aid, you actually (send) quite a bit to Israel's enemies, Islamic nations around Israel get quite a bit of foreign aid, too." Blitzer: "Egypt gets almost the same amount?" Paul: "Almost the same amount, so really you have to ask yourself, are we funding an arms race on both sides? I have a lot of sympathy and respect for Israel as a democratic nation, as a fountain of peace and a fountain of democracy within the Middle East. But at the same time, I don't think funding both sides of the arms race, particularly when we have to borrow the money from China to send it to someone else. We just can't do it anymore. The debt is all-consuming and it threatens our well being as a country." The Jonathan Karl interview. Then, on Feb. 3, 2011, Paul sat for an interview with ABC News’ Jonathan Karl. Here’s a portion of their conversation: Paul: "I’m not singling out Israel. I support Israel. I want to be known as a friend of Israel, but not with money you don’t have. We can’t just borrow from our kids’ future and give it to countries, even if they are our friends. ... I think they’re an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world. Should we be giving free money or welfare to a rich nation? I don’t think so." Karl: "And you think they can handle their own defense?" Paul: "I think they’re probably 10 years ahead of any neighboring country. I think their defense is very significant, and I think probably well in advance of any of their potential enemies." Karl: "Would you leave any foreign aid intact?" Paul: "No." Karl: "None?" Paul: "No. I just don’t think you can give people’s money away when we can’t rebuild bridges in our country." The Dave Weigel interview. Slate.com blogger Dave Weigel interviewed Paul at the conservative CPAC conference. "People emphasize too much the cuts to one particular country," Paul told Weigel, referring to Israel. "We had $500 billion of cuts. The cuts to that one particular country were three-fifths of 1 percent of it." • • • Interestingly, the public and media skepticism about Paul’s proposal to end all foreign aid, including aid to Israel, led the senator to backtrack. Paul’s own website includes a second version of Paul’s budget proposal, dated May 2011 -- two months after the first one was released. This one treats foreign aid differently. First, the new proposal scraps the section on Israel in its entirety. Indeed, Israel isn’t mentioned anywhere in the 65-page document. And second, Paul’s new bottom line for foreign aid wasn’t to cut it to zero. Rather, the proposal said, "Freeze foreign aid funding at $5 billion." Though the report doesn’t say so explicitly, that would have been enough to cover the outlays for Israel. This provides strong evidence that Paul, after taking fire for his foreign-aid policy in January, February and March 2011, abruptly reversed course. This approach -- keeping some foreign aid in the budget -- appears to be what Paul pursued in the version of his budget that actually got voted on by the Senate. The Senate voted down Paul’s proposal, with just seven voting in favor and 90 against. Paul’s office didn’t respond to a query for this article, but after commentators began to question the seeming inconsistency of his positions earlier this week, his office released a statement to media outlets. The most relevant part for this fact-check is this: "Sen. Rand Paul has never proposed any legislation that targeted Israel’s aid and just last week voted to continue and increase funding to the State of Israel. Sen. Paul is a strong supporter of the Jewish state of Israel. In 2011, Sen. Paul proposed a budget resolution that did not include certain foreign assistance programs in an effort to balance the budget in five years. Subsequent budget proposals made by Sen. Paul have included up to $5 billion for foreign assistance to account for U.S.-Israel security interests." While the statement his office released is correct that Paul’s original proposal never targeted Israeli aid -- Israeli aid would have been swept up in the across-the-board nixing of all foreign aid -- this response doesn’t support the notion that he hadn’t "really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past." The record shows he did, both in writing and in interviews. Our ruling Paul said, "I haven’t really proposed (phasing out aid to Israel) in the past." That’s rewriting history. Not only did Paul say he would eliminate all foreign aid during multiple media interviews in January and February of 2011, but as late as March of that year, his office released a budget proposal that included a zeroing-out of foreign assistance, with a section specifically inserted to defend the effect that policy would have on Israel. Paul is free to change his position, but saying he never held the position in the first place is flatly contradicted by his past statements and documents. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-05176	U.S. Rep. Paul Broun has not authored any legislation that has been adopted by Congress.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/15/stephen-simpson/ga-congressmans-record-skimpy-opponent-says/	One of the many criticisms of this Congress is it’s not getting anything done. A candidate hoping to replace one congressman from Georgia is using that argument in an attempt to unseat the incumbent. The contender, Stephen Simpson, said U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, R-Athens, has not authored any legislation that has been adopted by Congress, according to an article in The Walton Tribune. "Nothing he has introduced has ever passed," Simpson, who will face off with Broun in the Republican Party primary on July 31, told PolitiFact Georgia. "That’s a statement of fact." Not true, Broun’s office said. PolitiFact Georgia wondered who was correct here? Broun has successfully added several amendments to bills that his office says could have been done as separate legislation. The congressman’s representatives also say those amendments have an impact. Simpson said amendments are added to bills in Congress like sugar in coffee. Broun’s amendments, Simpson said, aren’t that impressive. Broun was first elected to the House of Representatives in July 2007 in a special election after the death of Charlie Norwood. He has served three terms. Simpson’s campaign website describes the challenger as a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who says he will be "a patriot, not a politician." "I think the message [Simpson is] trying to get across is Broun is ineffective," longtime University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said. The congressman has a near-perfect lifetime score of 99.2 on his voting record, as determined by the American Conservative Union, whose board consists of former GOP members of the George W. Bush administration and former Republican members of Congress. Broun’s score was higher than U.S. House Speaker John Boehner. Broun has proposed resolutions to make 2010 the year of the Bible and pushed for a Ten Commandments week and authored such legislation. He also authored a resolution to amend the Constitution to allow for the castration of anyone convicted of raping a child under age 16. The resolution was referred to the House subcommittee on the Constitution, civil rights and civil liberties. He’s been a vocal proponent of major cuts in federal spending. Bullock said being ultraconservative may have helped Broun in his former district. Broun’s new district has portions of metro Atlanta counties that are less rural and, perhaps, less conservative, Bullock said. "Certainly, Broun is one of the most conservative members [of Congress]," Bullock said. Simpson sent us a link to the website Open Congress, which tracks legislation. It says Broun sponsored 21 bills in the current congressional term and none passed. Georgia’s 12 other House members have sponsored 157 pieces of legislation since January 2011. Only three have been made into law. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed each piece of legislation Broun has filed since 2007. Most of his bills were forwarded to various House committees. There were a handful of amendments to bills and resolutions that Broun sponsored that did pass. They included: House Amendment 353, which reduced the funding for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management in the State Department by $600,000 and applied the savings to the spending reduction account. It was agreed to by a voice vote on June 1, 2011, congressional records show. The amendment was to a continuing appropriations act that was introduced on May 26, 2011, for spending through October 2011. House Amendment 647, which reduced the operating budget of the Office of the Secretary of Energy by $2.5 million and applies the savings to the spending reduction account. It was agreed to by a voice vote July 13. The amendment was to an energy and water bill filed June 24. Broun’s congressional office sent us other amendments that were approved by the House. Some, it said, are effectively legislation and as important as a standard bill. One agreed to in 2009 required that the Energy Department give Congress an annual report describing activities taken in the prior year, a strategic funding plan and other details. Other amendments reduced spending in the Office of the Secretary of Energy by $2.5 million, cutting funding by $181,500 from the Marine Mammal Commission and reducing $878,000 in spending by the Congressional Research Service. Simpson said the amendments are not comparable to standard resolutions because the amount of money involved is minute in comparison to the federal budget, which is more than $3 trillion. "In the scheme of things, it’s not that much money," Simpson said. Kyle Kondik, who follows House races at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, noted that the House was under Democratic control during Broun’s first three years in Congress. It’s very difficult for a younger member of the minority party to get legislation passed, Kondik said. Broun’s position on some issues to the right of GOP House leadership may not have endeared the congressman with those who have the power to shepherd his legislation into law, Kondik said. The number of bills authored by Broun that have passed "may or may not be a true measure of his performance as a congressman," Kondik said. Bullock said there may be some reasons why the representative has not had more resolutions passed. "He’s not particularly [a senior member of Congress]," Bullock said. "He’s not chair of a committee. He’s not really in a position to enact legislation." Broun has authored some amendments that have been approved by the majority of his fellow House members. There have been a handful of resolutions that passed as well. The experts we spoke with offered some context that offers the congressman a defense, such as the difficulty of being a Republican attempting to get legislation passed when Democrats controlled Congress. With that context, we rate Simpson’s claim Mostly True.	None	Stephen Simpson	None	None	None	2012-06-15T06:00:00	2012-06-06	['United_States', 'United_States_Congress', 'Paul_Broun']
pomt-12264	"Cuba is far more sanctioned than North Korea."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/07/hagar-chemali/are-sanctions-against-cuba-tougher-they-are-north-/	North Korea’s recent test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska has left policymakers wondering about the next step for countering Kim Jong Un’s nuclear ambitions. During a panel discussion on MSNBC on July 6, 2017, Hagar Chemali, a former U.S. Treasury Department official who now runs a consulting firm called Greenwich Media Strategies, argued that there’s still room to tighten sanctions against North Korea. When MSNBC’s Chris Jansing countered that many experts disagree with that argument, Chemali responded, "They say that because I don't think they realize how much room there is left to isolate North Korea. Cuba is far more sanctioned than North Korea." Does Cuba really face heavier sanctions than North Korea, a nuclear-armed rogue state? A variety of experts said Chemali has a point about U.S. sanctions against Cuba, but her comparison misses the bigger picture of international actions against North Korea. U.S. sanctions against Cuba are heavy (but not shared by the world) Chemali has a plausible argument that U.S. sanctions against Cuba are tougher than those against North Korea, experts said. "Cuba is subject to draconian U.S. sanctions -- a full trade embargo, restrictions on the rights of American citizens to travel or spend money in the country and draconian licensing requirements on financial dealings," said Joseph DeThomas, who worked on North Korea issues at the State Department from 2010 to 2013 and is now a professor at the Penn State School of International Affairs. "You need a license to do anything in Cuba as an American citizen." Despite some loosening under President Barack Obama’s outreach to Cuba, the sanctions on Americans’ travel remain stiff. "Currently, there are no restrictions imposed on U.S. citizens who wish to travel to (North Korea). However, they must fall under 12 circumscribed categories in order to travel to Cuba, such as journalistic, sports or religious purposes," said Andrew Otazo, executive director of the Cuba Study Group, which generally favors more open relations between the United States and Cuba. Financial sanctions against Cuba are also severe. "All financial transactions with Cuban entities or individuals are prohibited, other than those allowed under specific exemptions incident to licensed travel or for allowed categories like agricultural trade, telecommunications, health and medicine, humanitarian assistance, or remittances," said Ted Piccone, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. "This has caused most banks to stay far away from any dealings with Cuba." Chemali told PolitiFact that a key difference between the Cuba and North Korea sanctions is that there is no broad embargo on North Korea. The sanctions are "mostly comprised of targeted financial measures, focusing on elements, institutions and officials of the North Korean regime." Another factor is that many of the U.S. restrictions on Cuba are enshrined in law, rather than in executive orders or regulations that could be more easily rolled back. Why Cuba and North Korea are hard to compare Where Chemali’s argument suffers is that the situations in Cuba and North Korea aren’t exactly comparable. For starters, the United States’ unilateral sanctions against North Korea are just a piece of the puzzle. The bigger economic weapon against Kim Jong Un’s regime comes from a network of sanctions that involve countries other than the United States. "North Korean sanctions have a broad, vital multilateral component empowered by a series of increasingly strong United Nations resolutions," DeThomas said. "The key to successful sanctions there is to get the multilateral sanctions tightened." By contrast, the rest of the world essentially ignores the United States’ sanctions against Cuba. To the extent the U.S. sanctions against Cuba work, it’s because the two countries are natural trading partners due to their geographic proximity. Applying the Cuba model for sanctions against North Korea wouldn’t achieve the same result, DeThomas said, because China, Japan, and South Korea are North Korea's natural economic partners. It’s worth noting that, even though U.S. sanctions against Cuba are stiff, they are porous enough to have allowed for almost $246 million in trade between the two countries in 2016, mainly exempted items such as food and medicine. Indeed, Obama’s liberalization, though only partial, opened the door to new types of interactions. "Under Obama, U.S. citizens could do business with the Cuban military, money could be sent, U.S. airlines and ships could visit Cuba, and many Cuban products could be brought back to the U.S.," said Jim Cason, a former chief of mission with the U.S. interests section in Havana. By contrast, U.S. trade with North Korea -- a country that has no diplomatic relations with the United States -- totaled just $100,000 in 2016. So despite facing what, on paper, was a stricter sanctions regime, Cuba actually traded far more extensively with the United States than North Korea did. It’s also worth noting some important differences between the economies of Cuba and North Korea. For North Korea, 83 percent of its exports go to China, and 85 percent of its imports come from China. By contrast, no single country trading with Cuba accounts for more than 30 percent of either imports or exports. That means that Cuba has a more diversified trade portfolio and cannot be brought down by new sanctions imposed by an existing trading partner. North Korea, by contrast, could be crippled if China were to impose significant sanctions -- something that hasn’t happened yet. One category of commodities that gives North Korea leverage with China are "rare earth" metals, which are often extracted in North Korean "economic zones" in partnership with Chinese companies. "Chances are, if you are reading on a smart device with an LED screen, there are components in it from North Korea," said Nick Anguelov, an assistant public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Such consumer electronics products "can only be manufactured with the elements dysprosium, erbium, and yttrium, and if those components say 'Made in China,' it is highly likely they come from North Korean-mined inputs." Our ruling Chemali said, "Cuba is far more sanctioned than North Korea." Chemali has a point that U.S. sanctions against Cuba are sweeping and deeply embedded in law. However, U.S. sanctions against Cuba don’t make an especially relevant comparison to sanctions against North Korea. The important sanctions against North Korea are multilateral rather than bilateral, and Cuba and North Korea have significantly different types of economies.

pomt-09566	"President Obama's proposed 'spending freeze' will only reduce the $42 trillion in government spending proposed between 2011 and 2020 by little more than one-half of 1 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/28/john-boehner/boehner-claims-obamas-proposed-spending-freeze-wil/	In his State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010, President Barack Obama unveiled a proposal to freeze discretionary spending for three years to help dig the country out of a "massive fiscal hole." But Obama included some caveats. He said the freeze would exclude spending on national security as well as entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. And the freeze won't take effect until next year, "when the economy is stronger," he said. "Understand," Obama said, "if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery -– all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes." That kind of belt-tightening talk makes for good sound bites, Republican leaders said afterward, but the freeze described by Obama, while a small step in the right direction, amounts to a tiny sliver of the country's massive (and growing) debt. "President Obama's proposed 'spending freeze' will only reduce the $42 trillion in government spending proposed between 2011 and 2020 by little more than one-half of 1 percent," House Republican Leader John Boehner wrote in a live blog during Obama's speech. But first, are Boehner's numbers themselves accurate? A report released this week from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the federal government will spend $42.9 trillion over the next 10 years. The Obama administration itself says the freeze on nondefense discretionary spending would save $250 billion over 10 years. That number, however, is a bit more speculative than the CBO's overall estimate. Speaking before the Senate Budget Committee on Jan. 28, 2010, Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said his office did not have enough details from the White House about which categories of spending would be exempt from Obama's pledge. Those details will be revealed when the White House presents its proposed 2011 budget next week. But Elmendorf said perhaps the most crucial factor in determining the long-term effect of the freeze is what happens in the years after the freeze. If spending immediately goes back to the levels they would have been at had they been rising all along, "then the savings are just in those three years, and they're small," Elmendorf said. For example, Elmendorf said, a freeze on all discretionary appropriations would only save about $10 billion in fiscal year 2011. But, he said, if you essentially reset spending levels and only increase at the rate of inflation after the freeze, "then you can achieve significant savings over the remaining years." That's the route White House officials have said they want to go. So that $250 billion figure cited by the White House seems in line with other estimates. And by that measure, Boehner's attempt to put Obama's proposal into context is accurate. A freeze that would cut spending by $250 billion over 10 years amounts to a little more than one half of 1 percent of all government spending over that same period. But he also relied on math that made Obama's freeze look especially tiny because the other number he cited -- $42 trillion in overall spending -- includes mandatory entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid as well as discretionary nondefense and defense programs. If you remove those items, Obama's freeze accounts for a slightly larger share -- about 4 percent over 10 years. The White House, however, puts a more optimistic spin on this statistic saying that by the middle of the decade, nonsecurity discretionary spending would reach its lowest percentage of gross domestic product in 50 years. Still the big-picture point made by Boehner and other Republicans is that Obama's proposed three-year spending freeze, which would apply only to about 17 percent of overall spending, does little to address the "massive fiscal hole" he described. "In sum, the outlook for the federal budget is bleak," Elmendorf said. So how much of a dent would Obama's freeze make? "As a share of the total deficit problem, it is a small step," Elmendorf said. So Obama positioned the spending freeze as a way to rein in the country's mounting debt, and we think it's fair for Boehner to put those spending cuts in the context of overall spending. We rate Boehner's statement True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-01-28T18:00:16	2010-01-27	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-08314	"Of the states that have a lieutenant governor, many are currently discussing the need for such an obsolete office."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/30/robert-healey/healey-says-many-states-are-discussing-eliminating/	The fight for the lieutenant governor’s office in Rhode Island has centered on one basic question: should the state keep the office, or eliminate it? Perennial candidate Robert J. Healey Jr. is running on the platform that the job is a do-nothing position that should be eliminated. He said he’d work to do just that if elected. In a recent commentary piece in The Providence Journal, Healey observed other states "survive quite well" without a lieutenant governor, including New Hampshire, Maine, and "progressive Oregon." Healey added, "And of the states that have a lieutenant governor, many (Illinois, Louisiana, Utah, Florida, Massachusetts, Connecticut and California, to name a few) are currently discussing the need for such an obsolete office." We decided to take a look. First, a few basics: Forty-five states and five U.S. territories have an officeholder who holds the title "lieutenant governor." They include New Jersey, which seated its first lieutenant governor this year. Arizona voters will decide Tuesday whether to create one. Healey sent more than a dozen citations of newspaper and magazine articles to support his statement that there is much buzz about eliminating the office. Most are opinion or commentary pieces with no evidence of current wider discussion, broad-based movements or any legislative action. Several articles did reference legislative efforts, including in Illinois and Louisiana; however those never got off the ground. The stories preceded the failed attempts. Among the articles was an August 2010 editorial in The Register Citizen in Connecticut, which, rather than endorsing any of the four primary candidates for the office, recommended instead that the office be eliminated. One of the candidates, Lisa Wilson-Foley, said she would refuse a salary, driver and car and would evaluate after two years whether the office should be abolished. She lost by a wide margin. To check the seven states Healey specifically mentions, we contacted state librarians, legislators, and editors at major newspapers. We heard from people in five states. We found nothing to support Healey’s claim that those states "are currently discussing" the need for the office. For example, Dan Harrie, political editor for the Salt Lake Tribune, told us "No, there’s been no talk of eliminating the office of lieutenant governor at all." Carrie Rose of the Connecticut Legislative Library told us there are no official discussions about eliminating the office in that state. Bob Shaw, politics and government editor at the Orlando Sentinel, said there has been criticism of the cost of the office, "but there has not been any movement to get rid of it. No legislation filed, no constitutional amendment discussed, or anything like that." "In my world, none of those states are currently discussing it," said Julia Hurst, director of the non-partisan National Lieutenant Governors Association. She said she would define discussion as "someone filed a bill," present tense. In Illinois and Louisiana, for example, "a piece of legislation [was] introduced in both states in the most recent legislative session – in Illinois, it did not get out of its originating body, and in Louisiana, it did not get out of its originating committee," she said. "In some states a bill can live for two years. That’s not the case in either one of those states ..." Similar legislation was attempted in South Carolina but never got off the ground. Louisiana State Rep. Cameron Henry, whose bills never moved out of committee, said in a phone interview that he plans to file a bill in the next session "to keep the lieutenant governor’s office, and merge the secretary of state’s job with it." When we presented Healey with our findings, he said, in his view, "When people are talking about it in editorials or newspapers, people are talking about the issue. That’s pretty much about the issue." In our view, his statement that many states are "currently discussing" the need for the office suggests substantially more than just people or columnists giving their opinions, or recent efforts that have failed. We rule his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02843	Says there’s no language in the U.S. Constitution that prevents someone from running for Congress simultaneously in multiple states.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/nov/20/allan-levene/candidate-planning-run-congress-four-states/	Crazy. That’s how one constitutional expert described Cobb County resident Allan Levene’s plan to simultaneously run for the U.S. Congress in Georgia and three other states. "I may be crazy like a fox," Levene, a Republican, told us by telephone. Levene, who lives in Kennesaw, recently posted an article on his campaign website claiming the U.S. Constitution does not prevent him from campaigning in multiple states. His plan is to run in Hawaii, Michigan and Minnesota. Levene believes the only constitutional requirement is that he has to be a resident of one of those states before the general election in November 2014. He says he can run in numerous state primaries without living in those states. Levene said he only has to establish residency if he wins a primary and wants to be on the ballot for the general election. PolitiFact Georgia first saw Levene’s claim on The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog. We wondered whether Levene is correct about what the Constitution says and does not say about candidates running for Congress in more than one state? Several experts we interviewed said they had never heard of a candidate running for office in more than one state at the same time. We, too, were unfamiliar with any such situations by an aspiring politician. Our research showed Levene may be a fox in regards to this claim. Levene was a late write-in candidate last year to unseat U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Marietta, who represents Georgia’s 11th U.S. House District, where Levene currently resides. Levene pulled 30 votes in 2012. Gingrey, who routed Democratic challenger Patrick Thompson, performed a little better, garnering 196,968 votes. Levene wants to improve his odds next year. He read Article I, Section II of the U.S. Constitution and came up with his idea. It stipulates that a member of the House of Representatives must be an inhabitant of the state "when elected." "It’s like looking at a wall and the hieroglyphics and I saw an opportunity," Levene, a self-employed information technology expert, said of the section. "Hopefully, it will work." One opportunity came when Gingrey announced his plans to run for the U.S. Senate in 2014, creating an opening, perhaps, for Levene. Maybe not. Several high-profile GOP candidates have announced plans to run for Gingrey’s seat, such as former Congressman Bob Barr, state Rep. Ed Lindsey, state Sen. Barry Loudermilk, retired U.S. Army Col. Larry Mrozinski and Tricia Pridemore, a former executive director of Georgia’s Office of Workforce Development who is also a close ally of Gov. Nathan Deal’s. In case Levene loses in Georgia, he’s hoping he’ll win the GOP nomination for a House seat in Hawaii, Michigan or Minnesota. Considering the recent cold spell here, we’d recommend Levene focus on the Aloha State. Levene, 64, said he’s too old to try the traditional route of "working your way" to Congress by serving on a city council or being mayor, then becoming a star in the state legislature before going to Washington. Perhaps. But doesn’t the Constitution prevent his four-state strategy? Here’s the conclusion Levene posted on his website: "According to Article One, Clause Two you must inhabit the state when elected. Elections are held in November, not the primaries where the top contenders are selected, typically one Republican and one Democrat. A candidate is not elected at the primary; that election is the semi-final. Even if a candidate wins and no other party opposes him, the election is not official until November. So that one day in November tells the whole story." The Federal Elections Commission would not formally rule on the constitutionality of Levene’s plan, a spokesman said. Levene said he is awaiting approval from the federal agency on raising funds in multiple states. Levene said he also contacted the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office about his plan. Spokesman Jared Thomas said his office contacted the state Attorney General’s Office for clarity about Levene. "Mr. Levene will not be disqualified in Georgia as a candidate for Congress in the event he also qualifies in another state," Thomas said via email. "If he, however, wins (the general election) in Georgia and one other jurisdiction, then we will assess from a Georgia law and U.S. Constitution perspective." Several constitutional scholars we interviewed also referred to that portion of the Constitution when offering their interpretation of the accuracy of Levene’s claim. Duke University law professor Guy-Uriel Charles: "That strikes me as correct as a matter of the U.S. Constitution." Emory University law professor Robert Schapiro: "He doesn’t have to be an inhabitant before" the primary. University of Texas law professor Joseph Fishkin: "I think the guy is basically right about the main point -- that you don’t have to live in the district when you put in your primary bid -- just when you win the election." University of Virginia law professor Dan Ortiz: "I don’t think there’s any constitutional problem there. It’s crazy. It’s, politically, a crazy strategy." Fishkin also had doubts Levene’s strategy would work. But if Levene wins the primary in more than state, he presumably would have to withdraw from one of the races, Ortiz said. To sum up, Levene said the U.S. Constitution does not prevent him from running for office in more than one state simultaneously. The one requirement, he said, is that he must be a resident of the state where he is running at the time of the general election. Several constitutional scholars agreed with his assessment. Levene might have uphill political battles ahead. But on his constitutional point, he’s a winner. Our rating: True.

pomt-08521	"Rhode Island has a very generous unemployment compensation rate compared to most other states."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/06/john-robitaille/robitaille-says-rhode-islands-unemployment-compens/	John Robitaille, Republican candidate for governor, believes that one reason more Rhode Islanders aren't back at work is that the state pays too much to people who have lost their jobs. During an Oct. 4 appearance on The Helen Glover Show, Robitaille asserted that unemployment compensation and welfare payments can discourage people from accepting jobs that are available, which is why the system needs to be changed to wean them from such programs. "One contractor who's a friend of mine told me that he had two people turn him down flat [for a job] because they were making more money on unemployment than wanting to go to work for $15, $17 an hour. That's wrong," he said. "Rhode Island has a very generous unemployment compensation rate compared to most other states and, couple that with our very generous welfare programs, and there's not really an incentive for people to go back to work." As of August, 37,298 Rhode Islanders who had lost a full-time or part-time job were receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Whether those payments discourage people from accepting jobs is a matter of opinion. We were interested in the question of whether the unemployment benefits are truly generous compared to other states. According to the latest numbers from the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training (RIDLT), during the first quarter of 2010, the average unemployment insurance payment was $390.53 per week, the fifth highest in the nation. Only Hawaii ($419.27), Washington state ($401.95), Massachusetts ($400.57) and New Jersey ($400.55) paid out more per person. Another way to look at the question is the maximum benefit you can receive. In July 2010, the cap for a single Rhode Islander was $551 per week. Five other states had a higher ceiling. Massachusetts was tops at $629 weekly. When dependents are factored in, Rhode Island ranks second, at $688 per week. (Massachusetts was the highest, at $943.) But that ranking is misleading because, according to RIDLT spokeswoman Laura Hart, different states have different limits on how many dependents you can claim. In Rhode Island, the limit is five. And that's not the whole story. Living expenses vary from state to state, and New England is noted for having a higher cost of living than many other regions. It's an important consideration, but not an easy one to gauge. The federal government puts out a cost of living index for different regions, but not on a state-by-state basis. Instead, RIDLT compared the average weekly benefits in each state with the average weekly wage in those states, using data from the U.S. Department of Labor. By the latest measurement, during the first quarter of 2010 Rhode Island ranked second in the nation. The state paid the typical recipient 47.8 percent of the average weekly wage of $816.71. (Hawaii topped the list, at 54.8 percent. Massachusetts, by that measure, was at 37.3 percent, ranking it 29th.) Put another way, the average hourly wage in Rhode Island during the first quarter of 2010 was $20.42. The average person receiving unemployment insurance got the equivalent of $9.76 per hour. The benefit could be as much as $13.76 an hour for an individual or $17.20 per hour for someone with five or more dependents. By all these measures, Rhode Islanders receiving unemployment benefits are doing better than out-of-work people in most other states, so we rank Robitaille's statement True.

pomt-14704	"Marco Rubio voted against authorizing President Obama to strike Syria after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-syrian-air-strikes-claim-against-/	With Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio attacking Democrat Hillary Clinton's foreign policy decisions, the Clinton campaign has fired back by asserting that "Marco Rubio Distorts Clinton’s Foreign Policy Record – And His Own." The HillaryClinton.com webpage notes that Rubio "claimed that Hillary Clinton 'stood by' while the conflict in Syria devolved into a humanitarian crisis. The truth is that Hillary Clinton was an early supporter for arming the moderate opposition against Assad in 2012." "And what’s even more amazing," according to the Clinton campaign, "is that Marco Rubio voted against authorizing President Obama to strike Syria after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people." We were curious if the "even more amazing" claim about Rubio was true, and he actually opposed Syrian airstrikes. PolitiFact has ventured into this area before, as a Clinton spokesman was quick to point out. In September 2013, Rubio was one of seven members on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (including two Democrats) to vote against authorizing U.S. military action against Syria. Three Republicans joined seven Democrats to approve the measure. The Senate resolution was debated on the floor but never came up for a vote because a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons issue surfaced and Obama asked Congress to put off action. At the time, as a former senator and secretary of state, and a budding 2016 presidential candidate, Clinton publicly supported airstrikes. Asked about his vote during the Sept. 16, 2015, CNN GOP presidential debate, Rubio said he opposed the action because President Obama "said the attack that he was going to conduct was going to be a pinprick." PolitiFact ruled that because Obama had repeatedly stated that pinprick attacks were not what he wanted to do, Rubio's statement was False. In the debate, Rubio added that, "The United States military was not built to conduct pinprick attacks," and he wanted a strategy that would put "men and women in a position where they can win." Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon indicated that opposition to those airstrikes doesn't mean Rubio was opposed to the United States becoming involved in Syria, which Rubio made clear during the Foreign Relations Committee meeting where he explained his vote. He predicted that the airstrikes would not work and reiterated his longstanding call for Obama to give arms to the moderate opposition in Syria. On Sept. 18, 2014, when the president asked Congress for approval to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels as part of a larger plan to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Rubio voted in favor of the proposal, which was part of a larger spending package. Clinton has advocated arming Syrian rebels as well. The Clinton website tries to make Rubio look reluctant to take on Syria or make it look like the senator has flip-flopped, including a quote from Politico that "Rubio was an early advocate of arming the Syrian rebels," and a Politico headline reporting that "Rubio the hawk turned dovish on Syria in 2013." Our ruling Clinton said, "Marco Rubio voted against authorizing President Obama to strike Syria after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people." Rubio did vote against the specific resolution for an airstrike campaign, explaining he was "unconvinced it will work." But he supported a subsequent plan for the United States to help moderate Syrian rebels lead the fight, an idea he had been promoting for a while. The Clinton statement suggests a reluctance by Rubio to intervene in Syria when, in fact, it's the type of involvement that's at issue. The statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-01-07T10:00:00	2016-01-04	['Marco_Rubio', 'Syria', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06823	"We’re only spending 2 percent of our GDP on our infrastructure, while China and India are spending 10 percent of their GDP reinvesting back into their country."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/09/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-says-china-and-india-outspend-us-infr/	As the House of Representatives discussed funding the nation’s energy and water development projects last month, Niles Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan waded into the debate to tout the need for investment in high-speed rail, highways, bridges, dams, ports and sewers, as a way to preserve the nation’s global competitiveness. "This is the dirty little secret here in Washington, D.C.," Ryan said as he wrapped up his floor speech. "We’re only spending 2 percent of our GDP on our infrastructure, while China and India are spending 10 percent of their GDP reinvesting back into their country. We will lose the future if we do not make these investments." PolitiFact always wants to probe Washington’s dirty little secrets, so we thought we’d check the numbers behind Ryan’s assertion that China and India spend disproportionately more on infrastructure than the United States does. When we asked Ryan’s office where he got his statistics, his spokesman pointed us to a pair of articles that ran earlier this year in The Economist. The first, titled "Life in the slow lane," claims the United States has grown stingier with infrastructure spending since the days when it funded transcontinental railroad construction and built the interstate highway system. . "Total public spending on transport and water infrastructure has fallen steadily since the 1960s and now stands at 2.4% of GDP," the article says. "Europe, by contrast, invests 5% of GDP in its infrastructure, while China is racing into the future at 9%." For data on India, Ryan’s office cited a July 21 Economist piece titled "India’s economy, the half-finished revolution." It quotes Morgan Stanley economist Chetan Ahya predicting that India’s infrastructure spending will "still be an adequate 8% of GDP this fiscal year." The article goes on to say that India’s government wants that share to rise to 10 percent over the next five years. The numbers in those articles don’t precisely match Ryan’s, though they bolster his contention that China and India emphasize infrastructure more than the United States does. We turned to other sources to see if we could confirm Ryan’s statistics on the proportion of Gross Domestic Product that each country spends on infrastructure. All the statistics that we found backed up The Economist’s reporting, although we were not able to find all three countries’ data for a single year, so comparisons aren’t "apples to apples." To obtain U.S. figures, we consulted the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. According to a November 2010 report titled "Public Spending on Transportation and Water Infrastructure," the United States spent $356 billion, or 2.4 percent of its gross domestic product, on infrastructure in 2007, the last year for which statistics were available. That matches the number cited by The Economist, and is close to the 2 percent figure that Ryan cited, though it’s not exact. For India’s statistics, we found a January 2011 report from the Indian government’s Secretariat for Infrastructure, which said that the India wants investment in its physical infrastructure to reach about 9 percent of GDP by 2011-2012. Tables in the report projected the number would actually be 8.37. The report estimated that India spent nearly 8 percent of its gross domestic product on infrastructure in 2010-2011, and 7.51 percent in 2009-2010. The number was 5.71 in 2006-2007 and 6.44 percent in 2007-2008. Those numbers approximate The Economist’s statistics, though they don’t reach the 10 percent cited by Ryan . All exceed the 2.4 percent ratio of GDP that CBO says the U.S. spent on infrastructure in 2007. To get statistics on China, we examined a 2009 United Nations University research paper on infrastructure spending. It says that China spent 9 percent of its GDP on infrastructure in 2006 - the most recent year for which it had statistics - and that India spent 3.6 percent. That number echoes The Economist’s data, and falls somewhat short of Ryan’s 10 percent figure. Ryan’s makes a solid point that China and India outspend the United States on infrastructure, though he inflated the amount that Asia spends, and slightly understated the U.S. amount. But his exaggeration wasn’t enough to push him statement into false territory, so we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Tim Ryan	None	None	None	2011-08-09T20:18:16	2011-07-14	['China', 'India']
pomt-01270	"Among the developed nations, we are the least economically and socially mobile country in the world."	true	/florida/statements/2014/nov/06/jeb-bush/us-workers-least-mobile-developed-world-jeb-bush/	Gov. Jeb Bush may or may not run for president in 2016, but he was certainly active in the 2014 elections. Not only did he campaign for other candidates, but he was doing fundraising for his Foundation for Excellence in Education. An October mailer he signed focused on the economy, a top concern for voters. "Americans could always count on hard work leading to higher incomes and improved lives. The American dream was real and within reach," Bush said in the letter. "But today, among the developed nations, we are the least economically and socially mobile country in the world." Bush goes on to say fixing an ailing education system is key to turning things around for children and the country. There’s no question times have been tough the last decade or so, but is the American dream really that unattainable? We decided to work really hard to improve our lives by finding out the answer. American exceptionalism First of all, we should point out that while social mobility and economic mobility are technically two different things, Bush is looking at them under the same umbrella -- a person’s ability to better their circumstances as measured by income. So that’s how we’ll look at them, too. His foundation didn’t have to dig deep to find experts who claimed the United States is lagging behind its global peers. They sent several articles and reports they said informed the claim, so we examined those. We’re not going to sugarcoat it for you, folks, because there’s plenty of evidence Bush’s assertion is on the money (so to speak). A 2006 study led by a Swedish economist compared earning potential across generations among the United States, the United Kingdom and Nordic countries. It determined that American men raised in the bottom fifth of family incomes had a 42 percent chance of staying there, considerably higher than the other countries (Britain was next at 30 percent). Only 8 percent rose to the top fifth in the U.S., the lowest in the study. In countries like Finland, Denmark and Sweden, that number is closer to 15 percent, almost twice as much as in America. University of Ottawa economist Miles Corak in 2006 reviewed several studies about generational income mobility -- that is, whether you will make more or less money depending on how much your parents made. Again, the United States came up last. "The United States, the United Kingdom, and to a slightly lesser extent France, stand out as being the least mobile societies, with 40 to 50 percent of fathers’ earnings advantage being passed on to sons," Corak wrote. "At the other extreme are Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Canada with about 15 to 20 percent of earnings advantage passed across generations, and in an intermediate position Germany and Sweden with about 30 percent." There is some debate about whether generational income mobility is a proper measure of mobility, especially because social structures and salary trends vary from country to country, but it does look as if the States aren’t as mobile as they once were. A Brookings Institution study from 2007 found that only 6 percent of American children born at the bottom of the income ladder moved to the top. Almost half of kids born in the bottom fifth of family income didn’t move up, while 39 percent in the top fifth stayed at the top. A third of kids moved up in brackets, sure, but another third moved down. The Economic Mobility Project of the Pew Charitable Trusts found similar numbers in 2009, widening the field a bit: 62 percent growing up in the top fifth stayed in the top two fifths, while 65 percent raised in the bottom fifth stayed in the bottom two fifths. These numbers showed things have gotten worse in recent years for Americans trying to move up in the world. Essentially, if you were born to a richer family, you had a good chance of staying there. If you were born into a poorer family, good luck. That trend is much more defined in America than it is in other countries. Wait, it gets worse Now let’s remember Bush wrote "among the developed nations." All the things we’ve looked at so far have stuck to European countries and Canada. But that’s okay, because University of Wisconsin economist Timothy Smeeding told us we can say plenty more countries beat us, too. He pointed us to the Great Gatsby Curve, a concept championed in 2012 by former chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton. The curve, named after the 1925 F. Scott Fitzgerald novel about class-hopping romantic Jay Gatsby, used data from Canadian economist Corak to determine mobility in terms of "intergenerational income elasticity" against several nations’ inequality by income distribution, called the Gini coefficient. The curve usually includes 23 countries, most of which are Western, and shows the United States lags behind other developed countries like Italy, Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand. Countries considered even less mobile than America include China, Brazil, Argentina and Chile. "Amongst the rich countries, Bush is right," Smeeding told PolitiFact Florida. "There are no rich countries, save tiny Singapore, whom lie to the right of the USA." With that data in mind, it’s hard to find fault with Bush’s argument, according to Isabel Sawhill, co-director of the Center on Children and Families and the Budgeting for National Priorities Project at Brookings. "It's a bit over the top but consistent with much of the evidence," she said. Our ruling Bush said "among the developed nations, we are the least economically and socially mobile country in the world." His Foundation for Excellence in Education sent us a few stories backing up the claim on a broad level. We found even more data suggesting that yes, America does lag behind most every developed country in terms of being able to move from the bottom rungs of the income ladder to the top. Experts we talked to said it was a fair claim, although we must note there is some disagreement on how mobility is measured and minor differences among studies. We rate the statement True.

pomt-07483	A space shuttle the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton would be "within a day's drive of 60 percent of the U.S. population."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/14/michael-turner/rep-michael-turner-congressional-delegation/	When NASA announced where its four retired space shuttle orbiters would be permanently housed -- at the Smithsonian’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington, in New York, in Los Angeles, and at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida -- the two most disappointed candidates were Texas and Ohio. Both were considered favorites to land a spacecraft, from a field that included more than 20 cities. Texas staked its claim largely on being home to NASA's Mission Control. Ohio is not only home to the Wright Brothers, pioneering astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong and NASA's Glenn Research Center, but is the site of the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Wright Patterson Air Force Base outside of Dayton. That’s where the shuttle would have been housed. "Unfortunately, it looks like regional diversity amounts to which coast you are on, or which exit you use on I-95," jeered Sen. Sherrod Brown, who joined the rest of Ohio's congressional delegation in calling for a federal investigation into the selection process. Members of Ohio’s congressional delegation jointly urged NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden to select the museum as a home for the shuttle because of it’s location. "Within a day’s drive of 60 percent of the U.S. population, the museum is easily accessible to millions from across the American heartland, hosting more than 1.3 million visitors annually," they wrote in a letter April 30, 2010. The 60 percent figure is one PolitiFact Ohio has heard several times. Brown and Rep. Steve Austria both repeated it in recent days. For purposes of this item we’re attributing it to Rep. Michael Turner, a Republican from Dayton whose congressional district is home to the museum. Turner was the lead signer on the letter, but he was joined by all of Ohio’s representatives and senators. Going back 150 years, and as recently as 1940, the population center point of the entire nation was in Ohio. But population drift, and the coastal tilt of NASA's decision, made us wonder if the claim still flew. And how far is "a day's drive," anyway? We traced the claim from the NASA letter to a statement on Dayton's municipal website. It said the city is "located within 500 miles of 60 percent of (the) U.S. population." That statement linked to a business story from the Dayton Daily News. It quoted Wright State University Professor Dwight Smith-Daniels on the subject of centroids: places that have a high proportion of a country’s population and a high proportion of its manufacturing, generally within 500 miles. He said Columbus/Dayton and the Riverside, Calif., areas are the two in the United States, making them important for supply chain managment in business. But he phrased it differently. "Ohio is within 500 miles of 60 percent of the country’s population," he said. Smith-Daniels’ comment gave us actual mileage for "a day's drive." It also made the claim for Ohio -- a big state -- and not just a site in one corner of it. And that make a big difference. We tested both versions using U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2010 census (numbers slightly more current than what Smith-Daniels would have had available). Working from the bureau's website, we identified all counties whose centers are located within 500 miles of Ohio's borders.The area reaches northwest beyond Minneapolis and east to include nearly all of New England and the eastern seaboard. They totaled 171.4 million people, or 56 percent of the U.S. population of 308.7 million. That estimate rounds to 60 percent, which is what the professor said. Then we identified all counties whose centers are located within 500 miles of the museum in Ohio's southwest corner. Their population totaled 130.5 million people, or 42 percent of the U.S. population. By our assessment, that means the congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats alike, went too far by applying a claim for the whole state to just Dayton. A 500-mile range from the museum reaches across New Jersey, but doesn’t take in New York city or New England. The congressional delegation’s underlying point was accurate -- a large portion of the U.S. population would be within driving distance of a shuttle in Dayton. But by narrowing the starting point for the range from the entire state, as Smith-Daniels used, to just the museum, they also eliminated more than 40 million of people. Then again, they also were smart enough not to say how far they’d drive in a day. With that important detail mentioned, we rate the claim as Half True.

pomt-07880	"The last Christians are about to leave" Iraq.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/feb/07/ron-paul/rep-ron-paul-says-last-christians-are-about-leave-/	Appearing on MSNBC, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Lake Jackson, said that a lack of stability in Iraq is having dire consequences for religious minorities. "Today there was an article, I think, on New York Times — the last Christians are about to leave there, " he said on Jan. 20. Paul’s comment came after news reports about an armed group, the Islamic State of Iraq, killing more than 50 people in a Baghdad church Oct. 31. The group said its fighters would kill Christians "wherever they can reach them," according to a Dec. 12 New York Times news article. "Dozens of shootings and bombings in Baghdad and Mosul" followed in December, the article said. "At least a dozen more Christians died." But still — the last Christians are leaving Iraq? Paul’s office didn’t respond to our query, but we tracked down a Jan. 19 New York Times news article headlined: "Last Christians ponder leaving a hometown in Iraq." Romel Hawal and his family are the last Christians in Habbaniya Cece, a town of 10,150 in Anbar Province, according to the article. "His wife wants to leave town or leave the country, joining an exodus of Christians from Iraq and throughout the Middle East," the article says, adding that about 70 Christian families lived in Habbaniya Cece before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. So, the Christians remaining in a single town in Iraq are considering moving away, along with other Christians who are said to be leaving the country. We wondered how many Christians still live in Iraq. Approximately 29 million people live in Iraq, according to a Nov. 17 report on religious freedom by the U.S. State Department. According to statistics provided by the Iraqi government, 97 percent of that population is Muslim, the report says, with the remaining 3 percent Christian or another religion. But the report notes that estimates of religious affiliations vary due to violence, internal migration "and lack of governmental capacity." Indeed, Juliette Touma, a United Nations spokeswoman, told us "there are no confirmed numbers on the numbers of Christians who remain in Iraq." Since Iraq’s latest national census was conducted in 1997, "we cannot really tell what is the exact number," she said. The State Department report says Christian leaders in Iraq estimate that 400,000 to 600,000 residents are Christians, down from an estimated 800,000 to 1.4 million Christians in the country in 2003. Why have Christian Iraqis been packing up? Touma pointed us to a Jan. 31 report by the International Organization for Migration, which notes that violence in Iraq — particularly in Baghdad and Mosul — is driving Christian Iraqis to move to more secure areas, both in northern Iraq and abroad. "Monitoring teams have been told by community leaders of increasing Christian emigration to Turkey since November 2010, which is confirmed by our colleagues in Turkey as well as recent media reports," the report says. The Switzerland-based IOM was founded as an intergovernmental organization in 1951 to promote international cooperation on migration issues, among other objectives. Threats and bombings targeting Christians occurred in Iraq before the October killings in Baghdad, but that incident marked the beginning of a more "systematized campaign of violence against this religious minority," according to the report. Still, Liana Paris, an IOM monitoring officer, called Paul’s claim "extreme." "Although there has been a great deal of upheaval among Christian communities in the country, we have also heard some heart-wrenching stories about families refusing to leave their ancestral homes," she said. Becca Heller, director of the New York-based Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project, similarly told us that "there is definitely a strong trend of Christians" leaving the country but that it’s not true that all Christians have fled Iraq. Next, we searched online for other reports of Christians in Iraq. A Dec. 17 briefing by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says "the Christian communities in Baghdad and Mosul have started a slow but steady exodus" since the October attacks. "In addition, our offices in neighboring Syria, Jordan and Lebanon are reporting a growing number of Iraqi Christians arriving," the briefing says. A May report by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a federal body that makes policy recommendations to the president, secretary of state and Congress. According to the report, the Iraqi government "continues to commit and tolerate severe abuses of freedom of religion or belief, particularly against the members of Iraq’s smallest, most vulnerable religious minorities," which include Christians. "The violence, forced displacement, discrimination, marginalization and neglect suffered by members of these groups threaten these ancient communities’ very existence in Iraq," according to the report. "Today, only half of the pre-2003 Iraqi Christian community is believed to remain in the country, with Christian leaders warning that the result of this flight may be the ‘end of Christianity in Iraq." The report says that out of approximately 1.4 million Christians estimated to live in Iraq in 2003, only about 500,000 remain. So, the number of Christians in Iraq has dropped significantly since 2003, but hundreds of thousands remain in that country. Paul is a prominent congressman whose utterances are widely reported. His claim that the last Christians are about to depart is not just hyperbole but ridiculous. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-02-07T06:00:00	2011-01-20	['Iraq']
pomt-06513	Says Bill Clinton opposes President Barack Obama's plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans.	false	/florida/statements/2011/oct/11/american-crossroads/bill-clinton-attacks-buffet-rule-and-president-bar/	American Crossroads, the conservative political group created by Karl Rove, is advancing President Barack Obama's trip to Orlando on Oct. 11, 2011, with a new television ad attacking Obama's plan to raise taxes on mainly wealthy Americans. The ad, called "Don't," also is running in Pennsylvania, and features a potentially powerful (and awkward) critic of Obama -- former President Bill Clinton. The ad splices together television news reports highlighting Obama's plan to raise taxes a total of $1.5 trillion over 10 years, then pivots to Clinton. "I personally don't believe we ought to be raising taxes," Clinton says in what appears to be an interview. "It won't solve the problem." Between the lines "we ought to be raising taxes," and "it won't solve the problem," the ad jumps -- for just a split-second -- to some other image. The cut-away caught our attention because we've seen instances where politician's words were cut in a way that would create a different impression. Indeed, after further review, that's what American Crossroads did here. The video of Clinton grabbed by American Crossroads comes from a 25-minute September 2011 interview Clinton did with the conservative news website Newsmax.com. The interview was set up in New York, where Clinton was holding the 10th annual meeting of his Clinton Global Initiative project. We found the original Newsmax.com video. The two lines quoted by American Crossroads come more than three minutes apart, as Clinton was delivering a meandering answer on how to create jobs and fix the flailing American economy. When American Crossroads quoted Clinton as saying, "I personally don't believe we ought to be raising taxes," they clipped Clinton's full comments short. Here's the full quote, including what American Crossroads left out: "I personally don't believe we ought to be raising taxes or cutting spending -- either one -- until we get this economy off the ground. This has been a dead flat economy. And you don't want in something this flat ... if we cut government spending, which I normally would be inclined to do when the deficit's this big, with interest rates near zero you can't get the benefits of it." So Clinton was as much deriding spending cuts as he was a plan to raise taxes. Clinton went on to praise Obama's plan to continue cuts to the payroll tax, saying it's a proven way to help the economy, before spinning off into a discussion of former President Ronald Reagan and former House Speaker Tip O'Neill. Later in the interview the second half of the quote comes up. But again, it's shortened. "I would pay it," Clinton said, referring to a millionaire's tax (though Clinton said that many wealthy New Yorkers like himself wouldn't be affected because they already pay high state and local income taxes that can then be deducted from your federal tax bill). "It's okay with me, I'd pay more," he said. "But it won't solve the problem." After the American Crossroads ad was released, Clinton fired back saying the group wrongly implied his opposition to Obama's plan to raise taxes on the wealthy -- sometimes referred to as the "Buffett Rule" -- as well as Obama's jobs plan. "The Republican group American Crossroads has used a quote from me in a video opposing President Obama's jobs plan and the 'Buffett Rule,'" he said in the statement provided to POLITICO. "The advertisement implies that I opposed the 'Buffett Rule.' In fact, I support both the American Jobs Act and the 'Buffett Rule.' I believe that it's only fair to ask those of us in high-income groups -- who have received the primary benefits of the last decade's economic growth and the majority of its tax cuts as well -- to contribute to solving our long term debt problem. "What I did say was that the 'Buffett Rule' cannot solve the problem alone. Reducing the debt requires three things: more economic growth, more spending cuts, and more revenue," he said. American Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio defended the ad's quoting of Clinton to PolitiFact Florida, noting that a 30-second ad cannot run two-minute-plus quotes and that the "quotes selected for the ad are the most succinct and relevant clips of Clinton's Newsmax interview, and fairly represent his views." We see it differently. The ad suggests that Clinton opposes Obama's plan to raise taxes on the wealthy as a means of reducing the deficit. By our review of the interview, Clinton actually appeared to straddle that fence. At one point, he said that he didn't think the country should raise taxes "until we get this economy off the ground." At another point, he said he'd be "okay" with the tax and willing to pay it, though he said in his particular case, he probably won't be affected. At the least, American Crossroads is guilty of cherry-picking parts of Clinton's statement to best fit into the narrative of its ad. But we think they go one step further by cutting out critical pieces of evidence -- namely that Clinton said he would be "okay" with higher taxes for the wealthy and that he'd pay additional taxes if he was required to. Clinton's voice and image were no doubt selected specifically because it'd be a stinging rebuke of Obama's policies -- from a fellow Democrat. But viewer beware. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07005	Rhode Island spends "52 percent more per capita on human service programs than the national average."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jul/08/gary-sasse/sasse-says-rhode-island-spends-52-percent-more-cap/	If you're strapped for cash, as Rhode Island certainly is, you're always looking for a way to cut expenses. One area often targeted by pundits, because it makes up such a large share of the state budget, is spending on human services such as Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income people. In April, we looked at one aspect of that portion of the budget, giving a Half True to a statement by Rhode Island Tea Party founder Colleen Conley that Rhode Island has the most generous welfare benefits in New England. (We found that every New England state, except Maine, pays more to its welfare recipients.) During the June 26 broadcast of 10 News Conference, Gary Sasse, former director of the Rhode Island Department of Administration and the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council, made a related comparison, saying that the state gives out far more benefits than the national average. Speaking of what is now the 2012 state budget, Sasse said that "of the $200-million increase [in overall spending], 90 percent is to support human service programs. We spend 52 percent more per capita on human service programs than the national average." When reporter Bill Rappleye asked for specific numbers, Sasse said, "Well, we spend about $9,300 per capita on Medicaid programs, and that's soup to nuts, that's everything from RIte Care to nursing homes. The average for the country is about $6,100. There's a $3,000 difference. "So the question on human services is not necessarily cutting back on eligibility, but looking at what optional services we provide. We provide about $60 [million] -- probably more than that, probably about $70 million -- in optional Medicaid services that many other states don't provide." We asked Sasse for the source of his assertion that Rhode Island spends $1.52 for every $1 spent nationally. He gave us two. The first is a Feb. 10 presentation developed by the House Finance Committee, which reported that in 2008, a total of $294 billion was spent nationally on Medicaid recipients. That averages out to $6,120 per recipient (19.4 percent of the money went to children, 13.5 percent went to adults, 43 percent was for the disabled and 24.1 percent was spent on the aged). In Rhode Island that year, the state spent $1.7 billion (about 52 percent of it federal funds) or $9,341 per recipient, with children and adults getting less (13.5 percent and 10.1 percent respectively) and the disabled getting a lot more (51.4 percent). House spokesman Larry Berman said the source of those numbers was the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which collects state and federal spending data. The per-enrollee spending is 52.6 percent higher in Rhode Island than the United States. Sasse said that's where his 52 percent statement came from. But what about the "per capita" spending? Sasse said in an interview that when he said "per capita," the population he was referring to was enrollees. However, we believe most people who hear the term will think it's based on the population in Rhode Island. Would the number be different if calculated using the general population? As a second source, he referred us to RIPEC's 2010 "How Rhode Island Compares" report. It's based on U.S. Census data from 2008 and looks at the cost of public welfare -- Medicaid and cash payments to the poor -- on the basis of state population. That report says public welfare costs were $2,036 per Rhode Island resident, which is 51.8 percent more than the $1,341 spent per capita nationally. If you just look at RIPEC's Medicaid numbers, as the House Finance Committee staff report did, per capita spending in Rhode Island is actually 55.8 percent more than the national average, a bit higher than Sasse said. Why does Rhode Island spend so much more? "We have very high residential care costs," said Sasse, a factor others have noted. In addition, Rhode Island covers some services regarded as "optional" by the federal government, such as adult daycare, assisted living for the elderly and hospice care for the dying. Sasse offered no specific suggestions about what to cut. He said that's for the politicians to decide; he's just looking at the basic numbers. Fred Sneesby, spokesman for the state Department of Human Services, said in April after we published our earlier item that it's important to consider "other fiscally meaningful differences among states; for example, the percentage of disabled and elderly in Rhode Island is significantly higher than in neighboring states as well as the national average." He pointed us to section of the Kaiser website, StateHealthFacts.org, showing that since the 2004 fiscal year, the state's growth in Medicaid spending has been significantly less than the U.S. average. He also said that eligibility for Rhode Island programs is as strict -- if not stricter -- than Massachusetts and Connecticut. To sum up, Sasse said Rhode Island’s per capita human services spending -- by his definition, Medicaid spending per enrollee -- is 52 percent higher than the national average. By that definition, he’s correct. He’s also correct in the more common use of "per capita" -- spending by population. So we rate his claim True. As often happens, our research on this item raised questions that go beyond the statement we evaluated. Chief among them: How concerned should we be that Rhode Island spends more than the national average? Advocacy groups rarely address the question directly when they offer their reports and statistics. The 52-percent figure could mean that the state is being overly generous with its benefits. Or it could mean that the characteristics of Rhode Island's population require us to spend more to give the same level of service that other states provide. Or it could mean that the national average is depressed by states that are declining to provide some of the "optional" services, such as hospice care for the poor, that some Rhode Islanders might regard as anything but optional. Such context would help voters and their leaders make intelligent decisions about where to attack the problem. It would also help them ensure that our money is being spent wisely on the services we want to offer. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-09096	Under President George W. Bush, "the national debt went from $5 trillion to $12 trillion."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/23/richard-durbin/durbin-misstates-debt-growth-during-bush-years/	In the latest example of congressional leaders sparring over the ballooning federal debt, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., took to the floor on June 22, 2010, to lay the biggest share of the blame on the administration of former President George W. Bush. During the floor speech, Durbin said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., "is right. Deficits are important. So are facts. Let's mention a few facts on the floor of the Senate." He continnued, "When President George W. Bush was elected, President Clinton said: Welcome to Washington. Here is a $230 billion surplus. ... But what happened in 8 years of Republican rule, fiscally conservative Republican rule? I will tell you what happened. The national debt went from $5 trillion to $12 trillion. ... "The national debt from Bill Clinton, $5 trillion; to the end of President George W. Bush, $12 trillion, and a little gift that President George W. Bush left to President Barack Obama as he left office. No, he did not leave him the $230 billion that he was given as he came into the presidency. No, he handed off to President Obama a $1.3 trillion deficit. Welcome to Washington, President Obama." So, "in eight years of Republican rule," was it true that "the national debt went from $5 trillion to $12 trillion?" No -- an important part of Durbin's "fact" is wrong. According to historical tables published by the Office of Management and Budget, Durbin was close, though slightly low, in characterizing the federal debt level at the beginning of Bush's presidency. At the end of calendar year 2000, just before Bush took office, the debt stood at $5.629 trillion. Fast-forward eight years -- that is, just before Bush handed the reins to Barack Obama -- and the federal debt stood at $9.986 trillion. That's close to double, but it's still about $2 trillion less than what Dubrin said it was. When we asked Durbin's office for comment, a spokesman acknowledged the error and said that the senator will be correcting the record. We considered the possibility that Durbin's office was ascribing the extra $2 trillion to policies begun under Bush that played out after Obama took office. But that didn't seem right to us. While it's true that the Congressional Budget Office did predict on Jan. 7, 2009 -- two weeks before Obama took office -- that the deficit for fiscal year 2009 would reach $1.2 trillion, that was a projection. The legislation that led to the actual deficits for 2009 was based on a blueprint inherited from Bush, but it was passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by Obama himself. In addition, Durbin's comment clearly talks about numbers at "the end of" Bush's administration, not at a point in Obama's first year. Finally, Durbin's staff did not seek to raise this argument with us. For those keeping track, the debt estimate for the end of 2010 -- two years into Obama's term -- is $13.787 trillion. That's a 38 percent increase over two years. Looked at another way, the debt under Bush went up $4.357 trillion over eight years, while it has gone up under Obama by $3.801 trillion in two years. Republicans and Democrats will continue to fight over whether spending, wars, entitlement expansions and tax cuts under Bush or spending, wars, entitlement expansions and tax cuts under Obama are a bigger reason for the growing debt. But we believe Durbin's floor statement was off by about $2 trillion. So we rule his statement False.	None	Richard Durbin	None	None	None	2010-06-23T14:15:04	2010-06-22	['George_W._Bush']

pomt-08008	Ohio taxpayers spent more than $67 million "for the year" on food stamps and Medicaid for Wal-Mart workers	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/12/robert-hagan/rep-robert-hagan-slams-wal-mart-over-workers-needi/	In addition to its reputation for low prices, Wal-Mart is recognized by some as a company that puts profits ahead of its workers’ well-being. State Rep. Robert Hagan, a Youngstown Democrat, capitalized on that distinction last month when he publicly chastised the megastore for all the public assistance its workers in Ohio receive. Ohio taxpayers’ contribution to public assistance for Wal-Mart workers was the focus of a Dec. 8 speech Hagan gave on the floor of the Ohio House of Representatives as he advocated for legislation he sponsored to shed light on employers with high number of workers on welfare. The bill failed that day, the last day of session. Ohio taxpayers spent more than $67 million "for the year" on food stamps and Medicaid for Wal-Mart workers, Hagan said. Hagan made clear he does not wish to reduce public assistance to those who need it. But he questioned why so many workers at Wal-Mart — which boasted $405 billion in sales last year — live in poverty and need Medicaid and food stamps. Spending on welfare programs, especially Medicaid, will be under the microscope this year as state officials confront a multibillion-dollar budget deficit. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to look more closely at Hagan’s claim. We checked with his office and were told the claim was based on a report the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services generated last year at Hagan’s request. The report listed companies on a monthly basis who employed the most workers receiving various forms of public assistance, including Medicaid and food stamps, from July 2008 to August 2009. Hagan zeroed in on June 2009 for his attack on Wal-Mart, which topped the Medicaid and food stamps lists in the report nearly every month. As we studied the report, we realized Hagan had to extrapolate certain figures to reach the conclusion that $67 million was spent on Medicaid and food stamps for Wal-Mart workers. Despite the overall fuzziness of Hagan’s math, which we will attempt to clarify momentarily, he did nail one statistic in his formula: the number of Wal-Mart workers and their dependents on public assistance. The Department of Job and Family Services tapped into its centralized system that caseworkers use to issue benefits and reported to Hagan that 15,484 Wal-Mart workers and dependents received Medicaid benefits in June 2009, and 12,872 Wal-Mart workers and dependents got food stamps. Hagan then multiplied those totals by the average costs in June 2009 of Medicaid and food stamps per recipient. The resulting costs for June 2009 then were annualized to calculate the annual total. This is what it looks like: $245 average cost (X) 15,484 recipients (X) 12 months = $45.5 million. Hagan used the same formula and the same reports to figure the annual amount of food-stamp assistance Wal-Mart workers received. $142.40 average cost (X) 12,872 recipients (X) 12 months = $22 million. Put both figures together and you get $67.5 million. While the number matches Hagan’s claim, it also has some problems. First, his cost-per-recipient figures are averages and are not specifically tied to the thousands of Wal-Mart workers on welfare. The food-stamp average of $142.40 was derived from a Department of Job and Family Services report — separate from the one Hagan requested — that dissected public assistance spending in June 2009. The report showed more than $205 million in food stamp coupons were issued to more than 1.4 million people for an average of $142.40 per person. The Medicaid average only accounts for only one type of Medicaid coverage, the Covered Families and Children program, which is most common among numerous types of Medicaid benefits. Using just the Covered Families and Children figure assumes all of Wal-Mart’s recipients are on that plan. Department of Job and Family Services spokesman Ben Johnson said there’s no way to tell what type of Medicaid coverage was applied to the more than 15,000 Wal-Mart workers and dependents who received assistance in June 2009. Lastly, Hagan’s math assumes the assistance Wal-Mart workers received in June 2009 is consistent each month for a year. A closer look at the report, which lists public assistance recipients on a monthly basis, shows little fluctuation in the number of recipients connected to Wal-Mart. But the monthly totals are never exactly the same. For all those reasons, Johnson said Hagan’s formulas produced an inexact figure to quantify the annual amount of public assistance Wal-Mart receives. "We would certainly take issue with that premise," Johnson said. Hagan’s method is something PolitiFact Ohio and The Plain Dealer might try to get a ballpark figure when exact figures aren’t available, but Hagan presented it as a precise figure. He later acknowledged his figures were not 100 percent exact, but said the goal of his failed legislation was to shed light on companies with thousands of workers on welfare. Even if Ohio taxpayers don’t pay exactly $67 million in Medicaid and food stamps, it is clear they are subsidizing Wal-Mart’s health care costs, Hagan said. So where does Hagan land on the Truth-O-Meter? He might have fared better if he had made his point by citing the number of Wal-Mart workers on welfare — an exact number at his fingertips — rather than swing for the fences by throwing out a juicy, and inexact, multimillion-dollar cost to Ohio taxpayers. While it is clear thousands of Wal-Mart workers and their dependents are on welfare, neither Hagan nor the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services knows the precise cost. There is an element of truth to his statement, but knowing that his dollar figure is extrapolated from one-month’s totals is an important detail needed to keep the statement in proper context. On that basis, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Robert Hagan	None	None	None	2011-01-12T06:00:00	2010-12-08	['Ohio']
pomt-07118	"As soon as Chris Christie was governor, he gave tax cuts to millionaires."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/19/new-jersey-education-association/njea-ad-not-renewing-jerseys-millionaires-tax-give/	In the latest attack ad on Chris Christie, the New Jersey Education Association contends the Republican governor is coddling millionaires while he cuts education, women's health care and public safety. The TV ad, which was also posted on the NJEA-funded website millionairesforchristie.com, claims that the governor cut taxes for the rich. The ad shows various images of Christie and in capital letters states sources of contributions to the governor and what programs he cut. The ad says, "We thought he was different but he took thousands in contributions from Wall Street executives, thousands from insurance executives, thousands from drug company executives, and as soon as Chris Christie was governor, he gave a tax cut to millionaires -- a back-door deal to reward the people who put him there. And what about the rest of us? Christie cut our schools, women’s health care and our public safety -- all to give a tax cut to millionaires. Chris Christie. Now it’s clear whose side he’s really on." PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether Christie "gave a tax cut to millionaires." The tax bracket has been around since 2004, when Gov. Jim McGreevey approved higher income taxes on residents earning more than $400,000. It became known as the "millionaire’s tax." For tax year 2009, Gov. Jon Corzine approved a one-year tax rate increase for varying income levels to help generate additional revenue for the state: 8 percent on income over $400,000; 10.25 percent on income over $500,000; and 10.75 percent for income above $1 million. The tax rates were to revert to 2008 rates on Jan. 1, 2010 -- before Christie took office. Democrats, however, wanted to renew the surcharge and approved a bill that would raise the rate from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent for about 12,000 state residents earning more than $1 million a year. The increase would have generated $637 million in revenue for Fiscal Year 2011, according to an analysis of the proposed surcharge done by the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. Christie vetoed the bill minutes after Senate President Stephen Sweeney brought it to his office. The Legislature was unable to muster enough votes for a veto override, which meant the surcharge was not reinstated. So did Christie "cut" the tax, as the ad claims? He actually did not cut anything, because there was nothing to cut. The tax had expired before he took office. The NJEA told PolitiFact New Jersey Christie's veto is the same thing as a cut. It's "a distinction without a difference," said spokesman Steve Wollmer. By vetoing the bill, Christie assured that millionaires would continue to pay the lower rate. Kevin Roberts, Christie’s deputy press secretary, said it wasn't a cut; Christie was just keeping his promise that he wouldn't raise taxes. To recap: The NJEA ad says that Christie "gave a tax cut to millionaires," which suggests that the governor specifically enacted a cut for a select few. In fact, the tax had expired and, when the Democrats tried to renew it, the governor opposed it. That's not a cut; his veto maintained the status quo. Still, the governor’s veto failed to enact a higher tax rate, meaning a lower rate applies. To some, that’s break enough. We rate the NJEA’s claim Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12569	There were "76 deaths in three years" at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center	pants on fire!	/new-york/statements/2017/apr/12/michael-kearns/how-many-patients-have-died-buffalo-psychiatric-ce/	Assemblyman Michael P. Kearns has called for a federal investigation into the number of deaths at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center. "I was shocked to learn of these numbers from the Buffalo Psychiatric Center," said Kearns, a South Buffalo Democrat. "Seventy-six deaths in three years equate to about 25 patients a year dying at this facility." Kearns has an intense reason to focus on the Buffalo facility. He opposes a state plan to close the Western New York Children’s Psychiatric Center in West Seneca, located in his district, and relocate its patients to the Buffalo Psychiatric Center by the end of 2018. The state has said there will be a separate entrance and wing for children at the Buffalo facility, but opponents of the plan still do not want children relocated. Kearns wants an independent investigation of the Buffalo facility before the consolidation, but the state calls that unnecessary. The state also disputes the number of deaths Kearns has cited. So, who’s right? Did 76 patients die at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center over three years? How many died at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center? The state requires facilities like the Buffalo Psychiatric Center to report the number of deaths that happened on-site and also certain deaths that happened away from the facility. Every patient death — inpatient or outpatient — must be reported, whether the death is related to treatment or not. If someone receiving outpatient treatment dies in a car crash, for example, that death would be reported. The facility also must count people who die within 30 days of ending treatment, regardless of the circumstances. Kearns cites 76 deaths because that’s the number reported between June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2016, on a document from the state Justice Center for the Protection of People With Special Needs. An advocate for children with special needs obtained the document through a Freedom of Information Law request and shared the information with Kearns. But the Justice Center calls Kearns’ claim inaccurate. "It would be inaccurate to assume that all 76 deaths listed in this FOIL response to have physically occurred at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center," the Justice Center said in a statement. "The information provided includes a listing of all deaths reported to the Justice Center of individuals receiving residential services at a particular facility or who had received such services within 30 days of their death." Further, "please be advised that we do not track where the death occurred, since a death could occur in a location that is not under the jurisdiction of the Justice Center, such as in an emergency room," the response said. The state Office of Mental Health, which runs the Buffalo facility, confirmed in an email that 13 people died on-site at the facility in the same time period. "During the time frame in question, there were 13 deaths on the Buffalo Psychiatric Center campus, all due to natural causes," according to a statement from the mental health agency. The 63 other deaths did not happen at the facility and could be unrelated to any treatment. The state did not have a breakdown of how many of the 63 people who died were still patients at the time of their deaths. Our ruling Kearns said 76 patients died at the Buffalo Psychiatric Center between June 2013 and March 2016. The number is misleading. The state Office of Mental Health confirmed 13 deaths at the facility during that time. The remaining deaths did not happen at the facility. We rate his statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-12685	"Unlawful presence (in the United States) is not a crime."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/15/florida-conference-catholic-bishops/being-united-states-unlawfully-crime/	As Florida House members took up a bill that would increase penalties for certain violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, participants noted a fundamental but often overlooked issue in the overall immigration debate: If you are in the United States illegally, does your mere presence in this country mean that you have committed a crime? It first came up in comments by Ingrid M. Delgado, associate for social concerns for the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops. She had come to the Florida House Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice on March 15, 2017, to testify against HB 83, a bill sponsored by Rep. Dane Eagle, R-Cape Coral, that would heighten the penalties for certain violent offenses -- including sexual battery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, murder, and the use of a destructive device such as a bomb -- if the defendant was in the country illegally. Delgado said, "Unlawful presence is not a crime. It is a civil violation." A few minutes later, Rep. Jennifer Sullivan, R-Mount Dora, spoke in favor of the bill, saying she wanted to remind her colleagues about the legal status of the people the law targets. "It amazes me, honestly, that we've even been talking about this as long as we have," she said. "I feel like in the midst of this, something has gotten lost that is a crucial, main point. And that is the fact that we're talking about people who are here illegally. That means that, legally, they are breaking the law." The bill ultimately advanced through the subcommittee on a party-line vote, with Democrats voting against it. But we wanted to get to the bottom of whether undocumented immigrants were committing a crime by just being in the country. According to legal experts, the answer is that most of the time, unlawful presence is not a crime. When we checked with the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops, Michele M. Taylor, the group’s associate director for communications, pointed to the 2012 Supreme Court case Arizona vs. United States. The majority opinion found that "as a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States." Experts agreed. Unlawful presence is neither a felony nor a misdemeanor, said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. It is a civil infraction that results in removal and a bar on re-entry for a certain period of time. "Not everything that’s illegal — meaning against the law or violating the law — is a crime," Shapiro said. "There are civil violations, like when you get a parking ticket. ‘Unlawful presence’ is one of these. You don't go to jail or receive any other criminal punishment for being in the country illegally — you get deported." Gabriel (Jack) Chin, a professor and director of clinical legal education at the University of California-Davis law school, echoed this analysis. "It is not a crime to be present in the United States without authorization, such as by overstaying a visa," Chin said. "But such a person is subject to being deported." That said, it’s also important to distinguish between "unlawful presence" and "unlawful entry," said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. Improper entry by an alien is indeed a misdemeanor, Roosevelt said. This distinction can make the use of these terms tricky. For instance, an undocumented immigrant who entered the United States improperly would have committed a crime. However, once that person is here, the simple act of being in the United States unlawfully is not by itself a crime. "It is a crime to cross the border other than as designated by immigration officials, but there is no separate crime for being unlawfully present in the United States," Chin said. Another example of illegal entry would be if an individual is found in the United States after previously having been deported. "Unlawful re-entry after a deportation order can be a federal crime, depending on circumstances," Taylor said. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that generally opposes loosening immigration laws, said that while illegal presence is not a crime, it’s easy for such individuals to run into separate criminal problems even beyond their method of entry, such as filling out an employment eligibility form to get a job when they aren’t eligible to work. Our ruling Delgado of the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops said, "Unlawful presence (in the United States) is not a crime." It is generally accurate that the simple act of being in the United States illegally is not, by itself, a crime. Rather, it’s a civil violation that puts the individual at risk for deportation, but not for criminal prosecution. However, it’s worth noting that someone who is unlawfully present might still have committed a related crime by entering the United States after having been deported, for instance, or entering in an illegal manner.

pomt-02888	"We have created new jobs here in Cranston -- more than 1,000."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/nov/10/allan-fung/gubernatorial-candidate-mayor-allan-fung-says-his-/	Announcing his candidacy for governor on Nov. 4, Republican Allan Fung promised he would create 20,000 jobs in Rhode Island during his four-year term in office. As evidence that he can do it, he pointed to his own record as the mayor of Cranston. "Hospitality, manufacturing, retail. In each of these industries we have created new jobs here in Cranston -- more than 1,000," Fung said in a speech at Taco Inc., in Cranston. "And this is what I intend to do as governor in every community in the state of Rhode Island." Such claims, common in political campaigns, are not always easy to check. The cause-and-effect relationship between the office of mayor, governor or president and how many jobs are won and lost in a community is complicated. So there is some hyperbole here. Unless a municipality directly hires workers, it doesn't literally "create" new jobs, any more than Barack Obama "created" about 3.6 million jobs during his first term as president. Finally, Fung took office on Jan. 5, 2009, when the economy was still in a nose-dive and the stock market was just two months away from its lowest point since May 1997. Nonetheless, we decided to check Fung’s claim. We called Fung's chief of staff and the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. DLT cautioned us that because local employment statistics vary on a seasonal basis from month to month, the only reliable way to compare time periods for a city is to select comparable months or full years. According to its data, from January 2009 to January 2013, the net gain of private-sector jobs in Cranston increased by 1,121, going from 26,631 to 27,752. (In that same time period, the number of employed Rhode Islanders declined by 1,099.) (If you add in government jobs -- federal, state and local -- the increase was 1,294, but Fung's speech focused on the private sector. The increase is even higher if you look at annual numbers -- 1,684 in additional private sector jobs from 2008, the year before Fung took office, to 2012.) So there's reason to believe that Fung's "more than 1,000" number is correct, even when you include jobs lost in the city during that period. But how many of those jobs were the direct result of efforts of the Fung administration? We posed that question to Fung's chief of staff, Carlos Lopez. The city, it turns out, keeps its own count of added jobs. Cranston's spreadsheet lists 37 companies that, Lopez said, were actively helped by the city. By its count, those businesses added 1,209 jobs. "Our criteria for this included a range of assistance, from a simple initial meeting with all of the required departments for easy, one-stop shopping, to actually guiding them along the permitting process all the way, to more complex things like having them take part of the revolving loan plan or providing them with tax incentive plans," said Lopez. "These businesses all received actual assistance, not just ribbon cuttings or PR-related things." We called some of those firms to double check the numbers. We got through to four top officials. All confirmed that the city provided assistance, even if precise estimates of the numbers of jobs created were off by a bit. Ernest G. Pullano, president of the restoration company Clean Care of New England, which went from Cranston to Warwick before returning to Cranston in 2011, said the Fung administration offered a "tremendous amount" of design, engineering and public works help. "As far as being conducive to business, they were fantastic." The city told PolitiFact that Cranston gained 25 jobs by the move. Pullano said about 10 workers were actually involved, but his work force has since grown to 40 or so. "They may have asked me at the time what I thought the employee base would be. That sounds like a number I would have given them for the new facility," he said. David Levesque, founder of the local Brewed Awakenings CoffeeHouse chain, said the city's economic development office offered financing assistance (which Levesque didn't need) and helped by working to let the coffee shop use the huge sign on Pontiac Avenue near the junction of routes 95 and 37, a sign that once advertised a Sunoco station. The city says the project produced 25 jobs. Levesque said the actual count was about 35. And Carl Palermo, executive vice president for the Virginia-based surgical device company Cadence Inc., said city officials were hugely helpful when the company acquired a Smithfield firm with 80 employees and, needing more space, decided to renovate an existing building on Plainfield Pike. The guidance offered by the city "saved us a lot of time and effort in terms of stumbling through the maze," said Palermo. "That may sound insignificant, but when you're completely unfamiliar with a state, that's huge." The city says 125 new jobs were created for Cranston there in 2009. Palermo said that wasn't correct then but it is now; 130 people work there. The fourth company official verified that jobs were created but didn’t want to be identified. It's also important to note two other things. In some of the cases, the businesses on the list were not necessarily new. Walmart expanded with 100 new jobs and Stop & Shop built a new store with an estimated 157 additional jobs. Those chains usually go and grow where the people are. In other cases, Cranston gained jobs because the city brought in companies originally located in other Rhode Island communities, which lost jobs as a result. Our ruling Allan Fung said his administration created more than 1,000 new jobs in the city. The city quickly produced a list of companies and an estimate of new jobs. When we spot-checked the list, business owners confirmed that they had received help from the city and the number of jobs was close to the city's tally. Although the evidence shows that Fung's administration deserves credit for helping them along, it was the businesses themselves that actually created the jobs. And all of this occurred as part of the recovery from a major recession. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-04755	The health care law imposes a federal mandate requiring middle-class Americans to buy health insurance "whether they can afford it or not."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/28/artur-davis/artur-davis-says-health-care-law-requires-people-b/	Back in 2008, Artur Davis was a Democratic congressman from Alabama who supported Barack Obama for president. In 2012, he’s a Republican supporting Mitt Romney who spoke at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. Davis used himself as an example to voters who’ve become disillusioned with Obama. "What a difference four years make," Davis said, lamenting Obama’s first-term record, including his signature health care law. "And in terms of their crown jewel legislative achievement: Who knew that when asked, ‘Could government conceivably impose a federal mandate requiring middle-class Americans to buy health insurance whether they can afford it or not?’ That the Obama answer would be ‘Yes we can!’ " Here at PolitiFact, we’ve fact-checked the health care law many times. Davis’ comments struck us immediately as a misrepresentation. The health care law does include a mandate for Americans to have insurance. But it’s not a mandate that applies whether people can "afford it or not." Here’s how it works: The mandate is a tax penalty assessed on people’s income tax returns. The tax won’t affect anyone who has health insurance. The uninsured, though, will be penalized if they remain uninsured. Supporters of Obama’s health law say the penalty is intended to prod them to get health insurance, not punish them. The law has provisions so that people with lower incomes can afford coverage. The law expands Medicaid, an existing government health insurance program for the very poor. And it gives tax credits to people of modest means to help them buy their own insurance policies. People who earn less than 400 percent of the poverty level are eligible for tax credits that go to help them buy their own insurance. That works out to $44,680 for a single person or $92,200 for a family of four. Those income levels strike us as middle class. Contrary to the impression Davis gave, the law does make exceptions if people can’t afford insurance. If people have to pay more than 8 percent of their earnings for a health insurance policy (not counting their employers’ contributions or the new tax credits), they qualify for a hardship exemption. That means they would still be uninsured, but the mandate would not apply to them. Also, people are exempt from the mandate if they don’t make enough money to have to file a federal tax return. There are also exemptions for illegal immigrants, prisoners, and people who have religious objections to health insurance. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care research group, explains via a graphic how the mandate functions. We should note that there are two tricky aspects to Davis’ claim. He says the "middle class" would have to buy insurance whether they could afford it or not. There is no standard definition of the middle class. Certainly many people who don’t qualify for assistance under the health care law would consider themselves middle class. And some of these same people might say that they can’t afford to spend 8 percent of their income on health insurance. Still, Davis’ remarks at the Republican National Convention make it sound like the law is indifferent to issues of affordability. That’s hardly the case. People earning less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level would qualify for tax credits to purchase insurance. And if a health insurance policy exceeded 8 percent of income, people would qualify for a hardship exemption under the law. We rate Davis’ claim Mostly False.

pomt-08854	"People come here to have babies. They come here to drop a child. It's called 'drop and leave."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/06/lindsey-graham/illegal-immigrants-anchor-babies-birthright/	It sounds like a way for illegal immigrants to get a foothold in the United States: Pregnant women from Mexico and other countries can come to the U.S. to deliver their babies. Voila! Under the 14th Amendment, the babies are instant citizens! That's become a popular talking point for critics of illegal immigration, who have dubbed the children "anchor babies." The implication often is that the baby U.S. citizens act as an anchor that that helps parents and other relatives obtain citizenship and other benefits. Several Republican senators, including Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have called for hearings on whether the 14th Amendment, which was adopted in 1868, needs to be rewritten to curb automatic "birthright citizenship." The most prominent voice pushing that concept is Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who proposed amending the Constitution to make clear that babies born in the U.S. do not automatically receive American citizenship. In a July 28, 2010, interview on Fox News' On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, Graham said that "there's another problem we have in this nation that I think is novel and needs to be fixed. If you come across the border illegally and you have a child in America, automatically, that child becomes an American citizen. Under the 14th Amendment, three court cases says there's a constitutional right to that. I would like to deal with the 12 million (illegal immigrants) firmly and fairly. You can't stay here on your own terms. You have to learn English. You have to pay fines. You have to get in the back of the line if you want to be a citizen. But I may introduce a constitutional amendment that changes the rules if you have a child here. Birthright citizenship, I think, is a mistake, that we should change our Constitution and say if you come here illegally and you have a child, that child's automatically not a citizen." Later in the interview, Van Susteren asked Graham, "How realistic is it that you will introduce a constitutional amendment?" Graham replied that he had to because "people come here to have babies. They come here to drop a child. It's called 'drop and leave.' To have a child in America, they cross the border, they go to the emergency room, have a child, and that child's automatically an American citizen. That shouldn't be the case. That attracts people here for all the wrong reasons." In a later interview with Van Susteren on Aug. 3, Graham once again referred to a "problem where thousands of people are coming across the Arizona-Texas border for the express purpose of having a child in an American hospital so that child will become an American citizen, and they broke the law to get there." We've dealt with one aspect of this issue before, when we checked a claim by Fox host Glenn Beck that "we're the only country in the world" that offers birthright citizenship. (We found that 33 others do, so we rated Beck's statement False.) This time, we were curious about Graham's statement that "people come here to have babies. They come here to drop a child." He portrays it as such a big phenomenon that it warrants changing the U.S. Constitution. But is the problem as big as he suggests? Limited benefits It's important to note that having an "anchor baby" won't do much to help a Mexican mom become a U.S. citizen. Because citizen children cannot sponsor their parents for citizenship until they turn 21 -- and because if the parents were ever illegal, they would have to return home for 10 years before applying to come in -- having a baby to secure citizenship for its parents is an extremely long-term, and uncertain, process. However, having a citizen child can produce some short-term benefits, said Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst for the Migration Policy Institute. Pregnant women and nursing mothers could be eligible for certain benefits under the Women-Infants-Children (WIC) program, which provides food and nutrition vouchers, and their children could enroll in Medicaid, although the undocumented parents could not. Having a child can also help an undocumented parent qualify for relief from deportation, but only 4,000 unauthorized immigrants can receive such status per year, and the alien has to have been in the U.S. for at least 10 years. That means very long odds, Rosenblum said. Most of the benefits of citizenship accrue over the much longer term. The child will be able to work here legally once he or she is old enough, said Roberto Suro, a communications and journalism professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in Hispanic issues, and when they're ready for college, they'll qualify for in-state tuition at most public colleges. "It is a hell of a lot of deferred gratification at best," he said. Mixed evidence When we contacted Graham's staff, they could not provide any specific data on mothers who "drop and leave." But they sent us several news accounts about the large number of undocumented immigrants who give birth to children in the United States. Graham is right on that point. According to a report by the Pew Hispanic Center, a think tank that has done extensive research on immigration policy, 3.8 million undocumented immigrants have at least one child who is a citizen. "Most children of unauthorized immigrants -- 73 percent in 2008 -- are U.S. citizens by birth," the center says. That's up from 63 percent in 2003. These statistics suggest not only that the number is large, but is also growing. To offer a concrete example, we found a 2006 article from the Dallas Morning News about Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, a safety-net facility for poor residents. As many of 70 percent of the roughly 16,000 women giving birth annually at the hospital were immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally, according to one survey cited in the story. So there's ample evidence that many illegal immigrants give birth in the U.S. every year. But how many of them came to the U.S. with the motivation of giving birth and then leaving? In interviewing medical practitioners in states on the U.S. Mexico border, we found mixed evidence. James Dickson, the administrator and CEO of Copper Queen Community Hospital in Bisbee, Ariz., located five miles from the Mexico border, told us that his hospital hasn't offered obstetrical services in a few years, but when it did, he did not see anything like what Graham is describing. "We had some" people who came to have a baby in the U.S., he said, but their goal was not citizenship. It was higher quality treatment or specific services that were unavailable in Mexico. Salli Gonzalez, a nurse-midwife in Seguin, Texas, who delivers about 30 babies a year, said that in the past two years, she'd seen only one person who would fit Graham's criteria. On the other hand, Lauren Weber, a midwife in San Diego, said that some patients from Mexico have confided to her that they've temporarily secured a U.S. address and a utility bill, which is typically enough to qualify them for birth-related care paid by California's version of Medicaid. "There are a million hardworking Hispanic people in San Diego who came here to work and then happened to have a baby," she said. "Then there are people who come over in order to have a baby." She estimated that in the clinic where she works part time, a third to a quarter of her patients have come over for the express purpose of having a baby, and the rest are staying in the U.S. for the longer term, whatever their legal status may be. Weber also noted that she's treated wealthier patients who get the proper visas and fly to the United States to have a child. They come from such countries as China, Pakistan and India. Less affluent Filipinos have also come on tourist visas, she said, and some affluent Mexicans come to give birth as well. This is a pattern cited in a series of recent news accounts. One article, by the Associated Press on June 28, 2009, details a "birth package" offered by the Tucson Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz., to affluent Mexican women. "This is not a new phenomena," the Mexican consul general in Tucson, Juan Manuel Calderon Jaimes, told the AP, saying he's seen the practice for almost 30 years. "Many families of means in Sonora send their wives here to give birth because they have the resources to pay for the services." The article reported that "expectant mothers can either schedule a Caesarean section or arrive a few weeks before their due dates to give birth at TMC. It is one of 13 packages aimed at Mexican families, some of which include a stay at a local resort and shopping excursion. Tucson Medical Center's maternity package costs $2,300 for a vaginal birth with a two-day stay and $4,600 for a Caesarean section and a four-day stay, assuming no complications." Another article, published in the Washington Post on July 18, 2010, featured a Shanghai-based firm that charges $14,750 for a three-month stay in a center in California. The package includes "two months before the birth and a month after," according to the article. "A room with cable TV and a wireless Internet connection, plus three meals, starts at $35 a day. The doctors and staff all speak Chinese. There are shopping and sightseeing trips. The mothers must pay their own airfare and are responsible for getting a U.S. visa, although (the firm) will help them fill out the application form." In such cases, it's hard to determine whether mothers-to-be are coming to the U.S. for higher-quality medical treatment or the benefits of citizenship. Data doesn't support Graham's claim Immigration data and surveys don't provide much support for Graham's notion that many women are illegally crossing the border in large numbers to have children, then leaving. First, immigration from Mexico to the U.S. tends to go up and down in tandem with the health of the economy. According to another Pew Hispanic Center report, immigration from Mexico dropped by about one-third between 2000-2001 and 2002-2003, coinciding with the recession precipitated by the dot-com bust and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The numbers climbed back as the economy recovered, rising close to their pre-decline numbers by 2005-2006. Then, the numbers fell again, starting in 2006-2007 (a bit before the current recession began) and have continued to fall as the economy has sputtered. It should be noted that these are numbers for all immigrants coming from Mexico, legal and illegal combined. But Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center, said that since illegal immigration historically accounts for 80 to 85 percent of all new immigration from Mexico, the trends for all immigrants tend to mirror those for illegal immigrants alone. "All the data suggests that people come here to work -- especially Mexicans, and especially illegal Mexicans," said Suro. "If people came here because they were looking for work, you would expect to see the flow fluctuate with employment opportunities -- and that’s what the data shows. If people came here to have babies, the flows would be pretty constant, and they are not." There's something else you don't see, Suro said. If having a baby was a significant driving factor in illegal immigration, you would expect to see a higher percentage of women of child-bearing age in the U.S. illegally compared to men of the same age. In fact, just the opposite is the case. Numbers from the Pew Hispanic Center show that in four separate age ranges between 20 and 40, undocumented men significantly outnumber undocumented women. Finally, there's direct testimony from actual immigrants. Princeton University sociologist Douglas Massey conducted in-depth interviews with 159 Latin American immigrants -- most of whom came to the U.S. illegally -- for a recent book he coauthored with Magaly Sanchez R., Brokered Boundaries: Constructing Immigrant Identity in Anti-Immigrant Times. When they were asked about their motivations for coming to the U.S., "no one ever mentioned having kids in the U.S." Massey said. "I've been surveying Mexican immigrants to the U.S. for 30 years as part of the Mexican Migration Project. We don't ask people their reasons for migrating because most people cannot really articulate the reasons very well -- you get simple answers like, 'I came for the money,' but that doesn't tell you much because people can want money for all kinds of reasons. But we do ask about their migratory behavior, which we then link to social and economic conditions on both sides of the border. What our work shows is that migrants come in response to labor demand in the U.S. and are motivated by economic problems at home." Misleading comments Undoubtedly, citizenship plays some role in the decisions by undocumented immigrants to come to the U.S. After all, they have made a decision to make their future in the United States rather than in their home country, and part of building a better life in the U.S. is having citizenship for their children. But on Fox, Graham termed the practice "drop and leave," which suggests that illegal immigrants are coming here for the primary purpose of having babies with citizenship, then rushing home to wherever they came from. Graham's comments on this are misleading. While that does appear to be happening with affluent "birth tourists," it's important to understand that those affluent "birth tourists" are not the ones illegally crossing the Rio Grande or the Sonoran desert. They are coming here with the proper legal papers and giving birth. Thus, whatever public policy challenges arise from "birth tourism" are separate and distinct from the public policy challenges of illegal immigration -- which is not at all the impression that Graham gave in his Fox appearance. Graham tacitly acknowledged this distinction in his follow-up appearance on Van Susteren's show on Aug. 3, 2010, saying, "You have found and I've provided you information about groups that are marketing to Chinese, and Mideastern and European families a 90-day visa package, where you come to America as a tourist. You come to a resort. You have your child at a hospital within the resort. That child is an American citizen. You turn around and leave." But raising this example days later strikes us as an after-the-fact justification. So let's recap. It's true that many illegal immigrants are having children in the U.S. However, we are not convinced that "drop and leave" is a phenomenon. The data suggests that the motivator for illegal immigrants is the search for work and a better economic standing over the long term, not quickie citizenship for U.S.-born babies. Graham appears to be conflating two things -- a pattern of wealthy foreigners engaging in "birth tourism" using legal visas, and illegal immigration of poorer people from Mexico. In our view, failing to make the distinction exaggerates the alleged problem and uses inflammatory rhetoric to obscure legitimate policy questions. On balance, we rate his comment Half True.

pomt-11991	"So now they take drugs, literally, and they throw it, a hundred pounds of drugs. They throw it over the wall, they have catapults, but they throw it over the wall, and it lands and it hits somebody on the head."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/27/donald-trump/trump-largely-accurate-claim-about-drugs-catapulte/	A border wall with Mexico is happening, but it has to be see-through so that Americans aren’t knocked out by 100 pounds of drugs catapulted across the border, President Donald Trump told supporters. Trump offered the catapult story as an example of the lengths people are going to in order to get drugs into the United States. "So now they take drugs, literally, and they throw it, a hundred pounds of drugs. They throw it over the wall, they have catapults, but they throw it over the wall, and it lands and it hits somebody on the head. You don't even know they're there," Trump said Sept. 22 in Alabama while campaigning for Luther Strange, who was later defeated by Roy Moore for the Republican nomination in the Senate race to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions. "Believe it or not, this is the kind of stuff that happens. So you need to have a great wall, but it has to be see-through," Trump said. Back in July, Trump also spoke of a need for a transparent wall to avoid getting hit by 60-pound sacks of drugs. This fact-check won’t get into whether a see-through wall is the best approach for border security. What we wanted to know is if drugs have been catapulted across the border and hit people on the head. Trump was largely accurate about drugs being catapulted. Immigration officials have seized marijuana launched across the border, and in some cases, found catapults. Whether people have been hit on the head by these sacks is uncertain. Catapults have been used for years Reports from U.S. Customs and Border Protection about catapults date back at least to 2011. An attempt to catapult marijuana into the United States failed in January 2011 after U.S. officials noticed the preparation through remote video surveillance. They contacted Mexican authorities who went over and thwarted the plan. Mexican officials seized a sport utility vehicle, about 45 pounds of marijuana and "a catapult capable of launching contraband into the U.S.," the release said. The attempt happened near Naco, Ariz. In February, Border Patrol agents in Douglas, Ariz. seized two bundles of marijuana catapulted from Mexico, weighing more than 47 pounds combined, CBP said in a news release. Agents on patrol noticed several people retreating from the south side of the border fence as the agents approached, CBP said, and at the fence "they found a catapult system attached to the south side of the border fence." A search of the area led them to the two bundles of marijuana. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In July, the Douglas Police Department in Arizona seized more than 140 pounds of marijuana launched over the border fence. An officer responding to calls about bundles being launched over found "a large bundle of marijuana that had broken upon impact, exposing multiple smaller bundles inside," CBP said. And last month, Border Patrol agents in Arizona operating remote video surveillance saw an object launched over the border. Other agents then went to the area and found a large cylindrical bundle of marijuana weighing more than 96 pounds and worth $48,000, CBP reported. Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and director of its Drug Policy Project, said he hadn’t heard of any injuries associated with catapults or trebuchets (a common type of catapult). "Traffickers have definitely used catapults (and trebuchets) to hurl drug packages over the existing wall, but the chance of anyone getting hit by such a package along a 2,000-mile wall is simply laughable," Tree said. Other experts also told us that cartels have used catapults to throw marijuana over the border, but they were unaware of anyone actually being hit by the bundles. There are drug catapults and trebuchets that launch loads up to 100 pounds over the border wall, but that happens very rarely. Smaller payloads of 20 to 40 pounds are more common with the drug catapults, said Brandon Behlendorf, an assistant professor at the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security & Cybersecurity within University at Albany, SUNY. Our ruling Trump said, "So now they take drugs literally and they throw it, a hundred pounds of drugs. They throw it over the wall, they have catapults, but they throw it over the wall and it lands and it hits somebody on the head." Trump is accurate that, from time to time, catapults have been used at the border by traffickers. Packages of marijuana thrown over the border range from less than 50 pounds to more than 100 pounds. But we found no reports of people on the U.S. side of the border hit by the falling bundles. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-06141	Newt Gingrich "teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/21/restore-our-future/attack-ad-says-newt-gingrich-aligned-dems-global-w/	With just two weeks until the Iowa caucuses, a new ad from a pro-Mitt Romney "Super PAC" is attacking Republican presidential front-runner Newt Gingrich over "a ton of baggage" from his past. "Barack Obama’s plan is working: Destroy Mitt Romney, run against Newt Gingrich," a voice says as images of Gingrich flash on the screen, interspersed with damning headlines. "Newt has a ton of baggage. He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations and took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, before it helped cause the economic meltdown. Newt supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming. Maybe that’s why George Will calls him the least conservative candidate. Check the facts at NewtFacts.com." The ad, airing in December 2011 in Florida and Iowa, is paid for by a political action committee, which isn’t formally tied to any campaign but can spend money influencing elections. The one behind this ad is known as Restore our Future and is staffed and funded by many supporters of Mitt Romney. It goes after the former House speaker on several issues. Here, we’re focusing on the claim that Gingrich "teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming." The source The ad cites the website Newtfacts.com, which lays out a list of -- you guessed it -- more claims and citations about Gingrich, including this one: "Gingrich shot an ad with Nancy Pelosi in 2008 calling for action on global warming," followed by a link. In that now-famous ad, Gingrich sits on a couch next to Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the House. "We don’t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?" Pelosi says. "No," Gingrich answers, "but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change." Pelosi: "We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast." Gingrich: "If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need." The ad then directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, "Together, we can do this." About Al Gore The ad was created by a Gore-founded organization called the Alliance for Climate Protection that aims to spread awareness and prompt action to address climate change. It’s now known as the Climate Reality Project. WeCanSolveIt.org is the former name of the site now called ClimateRealityProject.org. "It is guided by one simple truth: The climate crisis is real and we know how to solve it," the site says. The group claims 5 million members worldwide. In an interview with the online news show The Young Turks in December 2011, Gore mentioned that he had asked Gingrich to do the ad with Pelosi and Gingrich agreed. It was part of a larger campaign featuring "'unlikely pairs,' who disagree on many issues but appear together to help thwart climate change," according to a 2008 story in the San Francisco Chronicle. What they’re saying now Gingrich, now tied for the lead for the Republican nomination, has big regrets that he made the ad. The Gingrich campaign directed us to a section of its website devoted to "answering the attacks." In the climate change section, Gingrich is quoted as telling Fox News’ Brett Baier that making the ad with Pelosi was "probably the dumbest single thing I’ve ever done." It goes on to explain that Gingrich opposes cap and trade legislation (although PolitiFact has found he supported it in the past), and he favors increased domestic oil drilling. In the online news interview, Gore lamented Gingrich’s change of heart. "I appreciated him agreeing to my request that he do it and I don’t want to be ungracious now. I’m grateful that he did it, and I’m sorry that he’s changed his position," Gore said. Our ruling Restore Our Future’s ad says that Gingrich "teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming." In 2008, Gingrich filmed an ad with Pelosi calling for action on global warming, and he did it for Gore’s nonprofit group. Gingrich might regret it now, but the baggage is still there.

pomt-14212	"The chairman of the party of Florida, who is an avid and outward supporter of Marco Rubio, gets to appoint 30 of those delegates."	false	/florida/statements/2016/apr/19/corey-lewandowski/donald-trump-manager-corey-lewandowski-botches-cla/	Donald Trump’s campaign has been crying foul over the delegate selection in Florida, accusing Republican party insiders of stacking the deck against Trump. In Miami-Dade County, home of former presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, few of the 15 delegates chosen April 16 appeared to be overt Trump fans. The next day, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski accused Blaise Ingoglia, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, of bias against Trump. "The chairman of the party of Florida, who is an avid and outward supporter of Marco Rubio, gets to appoint 30 of those delegates," Lewandowski said April 17. "Now, I understand those are the rules, but Donald Trump won. And now, you’ve got a person who is supporting Marco Rubio who gets to appoint 30 of the 99 delegates. That’s not what the rules should be." We will explain how Lewandowski got his facts wrong about the delegate selection and Ingoglia. We did not get a response from the Trump campaign for this fact-check. Florida’s process for choosing GOP delegates Ingoglia doesn’t get to appoint delegates, but he does get to recommend some -- although it’s half of the number cited by Lewandowski. The bulk of the 99 delegates are chosen by local GOP leaders and state committeemen and women in the congressional districts, adding up to 81 delegates. Additionally, there are three at-large delegates who are automatic: Ingoglia, National Committeewoman Sharon Day and National Committeeman Peter Feaman. Then as party chairman, Ingoglia recommends the final 15 delegates to the state party’s executive board. The 35-member board, which includes Ingoglia, will vote on those delegates at its meeting in Tampa on May 14. "This has been the process for over a decade," state party spokesman Wadi Gaitan told PolitiFact Florida. Ingoglia is reviewing applications and hasn’t announced who he will recommend. Ties between Ingoglia and Rubio Lewandowski is wrong that Ingoglia supported Rubio in the presidential race. He hasn’t endorsed anyone. While there is evidence that Ingoglia and Rubio have supported each other in the past, it was before Rubio’s campaign for president and Ingoglia’s role as state party chair. "At no point did he fund-raise or do any kind of favor for one candidate over another," Gaitan said. "We have no idea what Mr. Lewandowski is talking about. The state party and our chairman have been consistently clear that we have and will continue to remain neutral during this process." Ingoglia stayed out of the presidential primary and avoided bashing Trump. For example, when several politicians weighed in on Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims, Ingoglia declined to respond when asked by a Tampa Bay Times reporter. Ingoglia gave money to Rubio’s first U.S. Senate race and then his Senate campaign account, but it was a tiny amount of Rubio’s haul. And it’s not not unusual for a Republican activist such as Ingoglia to give to a statewide candidate. On April 6, 2009, Ingoglia donated $250 to Rubio’s U.S. Senate race. Later that month Ingoglia became the Hernando County GOP chair. On Sept. 30, 2013, Ingoglia gave $1,000 to the Rubio Victory Committee, a Senate account. At that point, Rubio was in his first full year in the Senate and wasn’t running for president yet. In 2014, Rubio endorsed Ingoglia’s state House bid which he won. Ingoglia was elected by party activists as state chair in January 2015. Rubio announced his presidential race in April 2015. So Ingoglia supported Rubio when he was a Senate candidate and senator and Rubio backed Ingoglia’s state House race. But that doesn’t prove Ingoglia was an "avid" supporter of Rubio’s presidential race. After Trump swept the Florida primary, we found a couple of examples of Ingoglia making nice with Trump, but he still doesn’t endorse him. In an interview on CNN on primary night, Ingoglia gave credit to Trump for GOP turnout. "And we had record, historic turnout here in the state of Florida. ... ," Ingoglia said. "The first thing I would say is that Donald Trump is definitely activating a lot of voters that have been dormant and sitting on the sidelines for at least the last two presidential elections." Days later, Ingoglia had a photo taken of himself with Trump and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi at the Palm Beach Lincoln Day dinner where Trump gave the keynote speech. "Typical Sunday night ... having dinner with a couple of friends," Ingoglia posted on Instagram. But there is another state GOP leader who has lambasted Trump. Tampa Bay Times political editor Adam C. Smith wrote that, "the real leader of the state GOP is incoming Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran." The Florida House is the most importance source of funds for the party because Gov. Rick Scott and the state Senate pulled their finance operations out of the state party. Corcoran has bashed Trump: "What birthed the phenomenon of a candidate who in all definition of the word is running a quasi-repugnant campaign that is baseless? You have a candidate who has flip-flopped on every issue,'' Corcoran said in a speech to the Florida Chamber in January. Our ruling Lewandowski is wrong on multiple fronts for his statement that "the chairman of the party of Florida, who is an avid and outward supporter of Marco Rubio, gets to appoint 30 of those (99) delegates." State party chairman Blaise Ingoglia doesn’t get to appoint delegates. However, he gets to recommend 15 delegates to the state party’s executive board, which then takes a vote. So Lewandowski doubled the number and exaggerated Ingoglia’s power. Most of the 99 delegates are chosen by party leaders in congressional districts. Also, Lewandowski has no proof that Ingoglia is an "avid and outward supporter" of Rubio’s presidential bid. Ingoglia donated $1,250 to Rubio when he was a Senate candidate or a senator, but that was years before he ran for president. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/24a8a2c1-25ad-4ff6-bdac-47f2b43b3e0b	None	Corey Lewandowski	None	None	None	2016-04-19T18:05:54	2016-04-17	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-14241	If the mayor were really serious about supporting Philly's schoolchildren and handling our city's looming fiscal crisis, he could begin by slashing the size of his own administration, which is already 45 percent larger than his predecessor's and 40 percent more costly.	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/13/joe-defelice/jim-kenneys-mayors-office-budgeted-cost-800k-less-/	Budget talks lead to debate every spring, and this year Mayor Jim Kenney’s proposed 3-cent soda tax has made the stakes higher than usual. On Sunday, the city’s Republican Party made its views on the tax clear. City Committee chairman Joe DeFelice wrote an editorial for the Inquirer headlined "Mayor’s soda tax is a Big Gulp of folly." One of his suggestions for Kenney for dealing with funding for Pre-K, as well as Philly’s other financial problems, was to look at the size of his "own administration," which DeFelice wrote "is already 45 percent larger than his predecessor's and 40 percent more costly." Has the mayor’s administration grown by that much under Kenney? And what actually counts as his administration? DeFelice said he was referring to a February Inquirer article comparing the organizational structure of Kenney’s cabinet to Nutter’s. The article noted 16 people reported directly to Kenney and 11 reported to Nutter and also gave the combined salaries for the people under each mayor's watch. Those numbers and DeFelice’s interpretation of them check out. Kenney has 16 staffers reporting directly to him. Nutter had 11, according to the last organizational chart released by the city in his tenure. That’s a 45.5 percent difference. Kenney’s 16 staffers make $2,584,872 added together. Using the 2015 salary data available for nine of Nutter’s staffers and 2013 numbers, which were the last readily available for the other two, they made $1,907,118. The percentage difference is 35.5 percent. That’s not quite 40 percent but could be charitably rounded up. That said, Committee of Seventy President/CEO David Thornburgh said the comparison regarding the number of people who reported to the mayor wasn’t necessarily a helpful one or the same as calling it the mayor's "administration." "People generally think of the administration in broad strokes, like 20-some-thousand people that work for the city," Thornburgh said. "That’s where it kind of hiccuped in my head. But you know politics." City employees are grouped into different categories. Those who work under the mayor -- but don’t necessarily report to the mayor -- are considered part of the Mayor’s Office. Kenney released a flowchart detailing the office’s composition. It features 22 people, and the salaries and expenses of the Mayor’s Office total about $4.26 million, according to the proposed FY 2017 budget. In the last year of Nutter’s tenure, his office was more expensive. According to the FY 2016 budget, the Mayor’s Office salaries and expenses totaled about $5 million. In terms of pure size, Nutter’s administration could actually be considered larger than Kenney’s. The Nutter organizational chart, which detailed the people who report to Nutter and the people who report to them, featured 71 names, including heads of quasi-governmental agencies like DRWC and SEPTA. The same type of organizational chart for Kenney features 66 names. Same goes for Nutter’s cabinet. According to the organizational chart released by the city, 11 people report to him, but his cabinet is actually larger. His administration listed 20 people as cabinet members in a January 2015 report about his accomplishments. That cabinet size would be larger than Kenney’s 16-person cabinet. Kenney’s Mayor’s Office does include several new positions he created, such as digital director, deputy mayor for public engagement and chief diversity and inclusion officer. Many of these new positions command salaries of $150,000 annually. Lauren Hitt, Kenney’s director of communications, said one of the cabinet positions was created because of a charter change and two others "because of broad consensus among the public and City Council that they were needed." The size of Philadelphia government overall has tended to grow year after year. In the last two years, the size of the city's total workforce has gone up while total salaries have gone down. In 2014, there were 29,779 total employees making $1.63 billion in yearly salary. As of March 2016, there were 30,254 making $1.57 billion. Our Ruling Republican City Committee chairman Joe DeFelice suggested Mayor Jim Kenney examine the size of his administration before enacting something like the soda tax and argued it was 45 percent larger and 40 percent more costly than his predecessor Michael Nutter’s. Those numbers match up when comparing the staffers who report to Kenney to the staffers who reported to Nutter, but the reporting structure in city government doesn’t give the whole picture. Nutter’s Mayor’s Office was more costly than Kenney’s office is budgeted for this year, and his cabinet was larger than Kenney’s. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-07890	Congressman Robert Hurt has a plan to cut education by 40 percent.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/04/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-rep-robert-hurt-supports-40-percent-cut-/	Fifth district Republican Robert Hurt has been in Congress only a month, but Democrats are already trying to ensure he leaves after just two years. The DCCC has launched radio ads against Hurt and 24 other Republican representatives around the nation, part of a "Drive to 25" aimed at putting House Democrats back into the majority. The ads are similar for each of the 25 districts. The Virginia one says: "Did you know Congressman Robert Hurt has a plan to cut education and research by 40 percent that will cost hundreds-of-thousands of jobs and make America less competitive? Tell Hurt to choose jobs." Forty percent sounded like quite a cut in education spending. In the spirit of learning, we set out to check the math. Jesse Ferguson, a DCCC spokesman, said the ad is based on a proposal by the Republican Study Committee, a large group of House Republicans. Hurt is a member of the RSC. The bill in question is the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, introduced last month by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the RSC’s chairman. The act aims to cut federal spending by $2.5 trillion over the next decade. The RSC wants to do this by reducing "non-security discretionary spending" to 2006 levels and holding it there for the next decade. The federal budget is divided into "non-discretionary" and "discretionary" spending. "Non-discretionary" refers to spending required by law to fund entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps. The amount set aside for these programs is not reviewed annually; instead, Congress periodically reviews eligibility requirements for people receiving the benefits. Discretionary spending is the money Congress controls through annual appropriations. It is used pay for an array of things including the military, education, transportation and FBI investigations. Ferguson said the 40 percent figure is based on a report by the Center for Budget Policy Priorities. James Horney, director of federal fiscal policy for the left-leaning CBPP, wrote on the think tank’s blog that returning to 2006 funding levels would mean a 42 percent spending reduction by 2021, if 2010 spending levels were allowed to increased each year to account for inflation. Horney told us his source for the information was the Congressional Budget Office. In the CBO’s latest report on the U.S. budget and fiscal outlook, the non-partisan budget authority said it projects non-defense discretionary spending will be $545 billion in fiscal year 2011. If non-defense spending grows at the projected rate of inflation, the CBO says the federal government would spend $682 billion for that category in 2021. The RSC wants a cut to 2006 levels, when non-defense discretionary spending was $409 billion. That is indeed a 40 percent reduction from the projected 2021 spending level, but a 19.5 percent reduction from the 2010 spending levels. Jim Bradshaw a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Education provided us with the spending on all elementary and secondary education programs during the past few year. In 2006 the department’s budget for those categories was $39.8 billion. The department has requested a $50.8 billion K-12 budget for the 2011 fiscal year. The figures include both mandatory and discretionary spending. Going from the requested 2011 level to the 2006 level would be a 21.7 percent cut. But Brian Straessle, communications director at the RSC, said the proposed reductions would not mandate a specific level of cuts for education. He said the bill would simply require that all discretionary spending fall to 2006 levels without specifying which departments would see reductions. In other words, the DCCC ad assumes a 40 percent cut to federal education spending, when that may not be the case at all. "The bill leaves Congressional discretion to decide the reduced appropriation funds from certain agencies and programs," Straessle said. "It doesn’t specifically say that the Department of Labor or Education has to go back." In short, he concluded, Congress could decide to make a small cut to education and offset it with larger cuts in other departments, so long as the total amount of discretionary spending fell by the required amount. Here’s another pin that deflated the Democrats’ claim: Federal dollars account for only about 8 percent of the money that ends up in Virginia’s schools. Uncle Sam sends just $1 billion a year to help them. The remaining $11.8 billion spent on public education this school year will be roughly shared by the state and local governments. So if Congress cut 40 percent from the federal education budget, it would mean a $400 million cut to education funding in Virginia. That would translate to a 3.4 percent overall loss in Virginia school funds in the worst case scenario. OK class, let’s review. The DCCC said Robert Hurt supports a 40 percent "cut in education," based on proposals by the Republican Study Committee. While there is no question Hurt and the group want to quickly implement serious spending reductions, the 40 percent figure actually refers to a reduction of hypothetical spending in 2021 to 2006 levels, not an immediate 40 percent cut. Furthermore, only eight percent of Virginia’s public education funds come from Washington. So even if all federal money suddenly vanished, the state would not see anywhere near a 40 percent reduction in education spending as the DCCC claims.

pomt-12614	Says extras are needed to portray aliens in a Star Wars movie being shot near Rosenberg, Texas.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/fake-news-next-star-wars-movie-isnt-seeking-extras/	This just in from WBN12: A Star Wars movie seeks Texans to appear as alien extras southwest of Houston. But don’t decamp just yet. This seeming news post proved as fake as a Wookiee. PolitiFact Texas looked into this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism and everyday life." We were suspicious of the Texas-tied call for extras from launch because there’s been no legitimate report out of Hollywood that a Star Wars movie is going to be shot in Texas. It didn’t help that the WBN12.com post is undated or that it’s identical, except for the place name, from a post saying the same about Las Vegas, Nev., that was debunked by Snopes.com--in 2016. Another sign the claim lacks validity? The WBN12 website includes a disclaimer stating: "wbn12.com is a satirical and fantasy website. None of the articles on wbn12.com should be considered true and are simply works of satire or fantasy meant for entertainment purposes." The 'call' for Texas extras The post, which came to our attention through PoiltiFact’s fake-news-spotting partnership with Facebook, is datelined Rosenberg, which is home to more than 30,000 people on U.S. 59 nearly 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston. It opens: "Reports out of Hollywood this morning are confirming that a portion of the next Star Wars movie will be filmed near Rosenberg, Texas. The undisclosed location near Rosenberg will represent a previously unknown planet in the Star Wars universe." The post continues: "No details were released as to exactly when production would take place in the Rosenberg area but they stated that it should begin no later than this fall. A casting call for extras will be announced well before that time period, however." The post goes on to say local fans (no one identified by name) are excited at the prospect and that producers (no one named) said in a statement: "We think that Rosenberg is a great place to find the hundreds of extras for our alien population and we’re very excited about filming here." No evidence for a Texas casting call We didn’t reach anyone directly connected to the Disney-owned Star Wars movies. Otherwise a web search turned up a Dec. 22, 2016, post on the moviecastingcall.org website describing casting calls for a Han Solo anthology film including mention that filming is to take place in 2017 "at the Pinewood Studios in London, England among other undisclosed locations in the United Kingdom," pretty far from Texas. Under the subhead "Extras Casting," that post says: "Casting calls and registration for extras will be posted here as they become available." We heard back next from the owner of moviecastingcall.org, Alan Baltes, who emailed: "My website posts accurate information" about Disney and Marvel casting and auditions. Baltes, noting WBN12’s disclaimer, described its post about casting for Star Wars extras near Rosenberg as one of several that’s surfaced about the next Star Wars film getting shot in Texas. "The same hoax has been posted over the years, making the same claim, but stating filming would take place in other areas of the United States," Baltes wrote. In Rosenberg, a city spokeswoman, Jenny Pavlovich, said by phone that before our inquiry, she hadn’t heard of local Star Wars shoots. A Fort Bend County official, Beth Wolf, said people around the courthouse had heard the Star Wars rumor though she hadn’t encountered confirmation. Wolf said by phone: "You know, we don’t have that many movies being made here." Our ruling A web post said extras are being sought to participate in a new Star Wars movie being shot near Rosenberg, Texas. There’s no evidence for this claim anywhere including on wbn12.com, which counsels that none of its content "should be considered true." Fair enough. We rate this fake-news statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-08184	"Eighty percent of the oil we're discovering, we're discovering in the deep Gulf" of Mexico.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/nov/28/joe-barton/rep-joe-barton-says-80-percent-oil-were-discoverin/	U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, who champions oil and gas producers, railed against President Barack Obama's May decision to impose a moratorium on drilling offshore during an Aug. 19 forum in Dallas. To buttress his critique, Barton lofted a factoid that stuck with us. According to a news blog posted that day by the Dallas Morning News, Barton called the moratorium "stupid" and said that 80 percent "of the oil we're discovering, we're discovering in the deep Gulf. When you put a six-month moratorium in place that could last indefinitely, you're not exploring for the very resource we need in America." Pack my trunk, ma, I'm headin' to sea. Eighty percent? First, some catching up: The Obama administration in October lifted the moratorium, which had idled 33 rigs in the Gulf, according to an Oct. 12 news article in The Washington Post, accounting for more than 25 percent of U.S. oil production. We asked Barton's office how he came to his 80 percent figure and then started looking for independent indications of how much of the nation's oil discoveries come from the so-called deep waters. From an online search, we found an article posted in 2004 by the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior stating that energy companies have focused on oil and gas resources in water depths of 1,000 feet and beyond. "Their progress in developing these resources has made the Gulf of Mexico the focal point of deep water oil and gas exploration and production in the world," the article says. The service estimates that the deep water regions of the Gulf "may contain 56 billion barrels of oil equivalent, or enough to meet U.S. demand for 7 1/2 years at current rates." Since 2001, the article says, energy companies have announced 11 discoveries in water depths greater than 7,000 feet. About 30 percent of the oil and 23 percent of the gas produced in the United States comes from the federal Outer Continental Shelf, with most of that production from the Gulf, the story says. In 1990, about 4 percent of the oil and less than 1 percent of the natural gas produced in the Gulf originated in deep water areas, but by 2003 more than 60 percent of oil and 29 percent of the natural gas was produced from deep water areas, the story says. Separately, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says online that as of 2008, 19 percent of U.S. proved crude oil reserves were believed to be in the Gulf of Mexico. We ran that by Barton's office and heard from Lisa Miller, a staff member for Republicans on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee. Miller said by e-mail that judging Barton's statement by the EIA oil-reserve estimate would misconstrue "both the context and the facts. EIA’s number references the amount of U.S. 'proved reserves' in the deep Gulf while Mr. Barton plainly was discussing production, not reserves." Miller pointed us to a chart on a web page created by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (formerly the Minerals Management Service) indicating that in 2009, 80 percent of the oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico was produced from deep-water sources. We pressed Miller on whether oil production is the same as oil being discovered. She replied by e-mail: "It's semantics." Not really, advised W. John Lee, a veteran professor in the Texas A&M University Department of Petroleum Engineering. Lee, who has expertise in estimating oil and gas reserves, told us that oil production and discovery "are not the same thing." Essentially, he said, discovery of oil reserves happens years before production takes place: "Production means developed and flowing. That comes many years after discovery." Eric Potter, associate director of the University of Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, agreed with Lee. Saying that 80 percent of discoveries are happening in the deep-water Gulf blurs the distinction between discovery and production, he said, casting the two as the same when they are not. Yet Potter also said that although he couldn't find an authoritative source showing where oil discoveries have lately been concentrated, he has no doubt most new finds are in the deep-water Gulf. Finally, we spoke with Steve Grape, domestic reserves project manager for the Energy Information Administration. Grape speculated that close to 100 percent of oil discoveries in the Gulf are occurring in deep or ultra-deep (meaning 5,000 feet or deeper) waters. Oil companies are probing those waters, Grape said, "in search of larger targets. They're located in deep water; no one has gone there before." He noted the administration has estimated that as of 2008, 81 percent of proved crude oil reserves in the Gulf were in its deep waters. To recap: Although experts we contacted agree that most oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico takes place in deeper waters, we found no proof -- if such data exists -- of Barton's statement that "80 percent of the oil we're discovering, we're discovering in the deep Gulf." Oil production is a different matter, as the experts told us. If Barton had talked about that instead, and clearly limited his geographical scope to the Gulf, he would have fared better on the Truth-O-Meter. But those are big ifs. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01000	"If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/04/elizabeth-cohen/can-you-really-catch-measles-2-hours-after-infecte/	The paid medical experts of TV channels are seeing a lot of time on the airwaves lately as they diagnose the country’s measles flare-up. It wasn’t too long ago that they were explaining risks of the Ebola virus killing thousands of Western Africans and the chances it could spread throughout the United States. This time around, the health pundits have spent considerable time spelling out the differences between the two scary diseases. Ebola, which has a low risk of spreading through the United States, is passed through direct contact with bodily fluids and not through the air. Measles, which was eliminated from the United States in 2000 due to wide vaccination, is a very different virus, explained CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. Unlike Ebola, "you don’t need to be that close to someone or kiss someone or anything like that" to pass it around. "It’s airborne," she told Anderson Cooper on Feb. 2. "If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person." We thought her example sounded alarming. So, after checking our personal immunization histories, we decided to fact-check her statement. We didn’t hear back from Cohen when we reached out to CNN, but we found information from a reliable source that backs up her scenario. Her example is nearly exactly the transmission description for measles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The measles virus stays in the nose and throat mucus of someone who has the infection, so it makes sense that it is passed around through coughing and sneezing. "Also, measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed," the CDC says. "If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected." Physicians encourage the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine because it is very effective in preventing the virus from entering the body (and as we found, the science is certain that it is safe). The disease is so easy to catch, the CDC says, that if one person catches it, a whopping 90 percent of people who are not immune (i.e. did not have the vaccine due to a weak immune system, age or personal choice) close to the infected person will also become infected. We can compare the contagion of each disease by examining the basic reproductive number, known as the R0. This refers to the average number of secondary infection cases stemming from one infected person in a "completely susceptible" uninfected population (if the population is vaccinated for, say, measles, the R0 basically disappears). As the R0 increases above 1, the disease spreads more widely. The R0 of Ebola is around 2, meaning an average of two people catch the disease from one infected person during an outbreak. The measles has a much higher R0 of 18, higher than AIDS (R0 of 4), SARS (R0 of 4), or mumps (R0 of 10). NPR’s Shots blog has a great chart breaking down this concept. Put another way, "Ebola's got nothing" on the measles epidemic, wrote Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center, in a recent Houston Chronicle opinion-editorial. "Just being in the room where someone with measles has been 30 minutes earlier can expose you," Troisi wrote. Troisi confirmed the accuracy of Cohen’s statement. When we asked about the discrepancy between her 30-minute window and Cohen’s two-hour window, she directed us to the CDC’s website and called her estimate "conservative." Our ruling Cohen said, "If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person." She is right. Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease, and the CDC gives this exact timeframe on its website. We rate her claim True.

pomt-00733	"America has lost over 50,000 manufacturing factories on other trade deals."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/23/ed-schultz/msnbcs-schultz-trade-deals-closed-50000-factories/	A Pacific trade pact moving through Congress has split many pro-union Democrats with President Barack Obama. Liberal MSNBC television host Ed Schultz is among those opposing the deal. The Trans-Pacific Partnership would expand trade and investment between America and 11 Pacific Rim countries. But Schultz says it's a bad proposition for the American worker. "Proponents of this trade deal claim that there have been net job gains under previous American trade deals," Schultz said April 17, 2015. "That's false. America has lost over 50,000 manufacturing factories on other trade deals. America has turned its economy to a paper-shuffling service industry economy." In this fact-check, we assess whether past trade deals have caused more than 50,000 factories to shut their doors. We sent a note to Schultz through the MSNBC press office to get more details on his statement and didn’t hear back. The number of factories The easiest part to check is the number of manufacturing establishments. Our starting point is 1993 because the biggest free trade deal, the North American Free Trade Agreement, otherwise known as NAFTA, took effect on Jan. 1, 1994. The Census Bureau gathers statistics on U.S. business and it identifies the ones involved with manufacturing. In 1993, there were 355,338 establishments. This is a count of manufacturers of all sizes, from lone operators all the way up to businesses with over 1,000 workers. Some people might say a guy in his garage doesn’t fit the description of a factory, but there’s no obvious point to draw the line so we used the most inclusive number. We drew on two census databases -- Statistics of U.S. Businesses and the Longitudinal Business Database. The numbers from both are pretty much in line with the other, but the longitudinal database has data for every year while the other is missing figures for 1993-96. Both data sets show a rise in manufacturing businesses immediately after NAFTA followed by a steady decline in the number of establishments starting in 1996 or 1997. (One company may have many manufacturing establishments.) The following chart comes from the longitudinal database. So how do Schultz’s figures hold up? He’s right so long as you include the impact of the Great Recession. Between 1993 and 2012, the number of manufacturing establishments fell by 71,525. Using the other census data set, the decline was over 90,000 (the totals vary due to different survey methods). There’s another way to look at the data. Schultz didn’t credit NAFTA with adding to the country’s manufacturers, but we note that the number of establishments rose in the first three years the treaty was in effect. Just because two things happen at the same time doesn't mean that one caused the other, but simply to cover our bases, we looked at the drop since the high point of 1996. Working from the longitudinal data set, that gives us 77,487 firms lost between 1996 and 2012. Schultz talked about losing "over 50,000 manufacturing factories," which seems like a safe number. Except for one big thing -- the Great Recession itself. Schultz said the country lost those factories due to trade deals. It seems difficult to argue that a global economic meltdown didn’t play a much larger role. Every sector took a hit to some degree, from retail, to real estate to construction. Looking back on the crisis, no one would claim that construction firms shut down due to NAFTA or any other trade agreement. To keep the recession out of the equation, we looked at 2007, the last year before the economy tanked. Doing that changes the numbers in a big way. Based on the longitudinal data set, between 1993 and 2007, 32,363 establishments disappeared. If 1996 is the starting point, 39,297 were lost. Using the other database, Schultz does better -- 56,261 since 1992 and 62,485 since 1997. We don’t know where Schultz got his facts, but one key data set suggests Schultz exaggerated the impact of past trade deals. Trade, manufacturing and the economy It is difficult to tease out the specific impact of trade on jobs. That doesn’t mean it can’t be done, but the details get tricky and economists will disagree on some fundamental facts. Schultz put the loss of 50,000 factories squarely at the doorstep of trade deals. From our survey of the research and feedback from economists, trade agreements caused anywhere between some and a lot of those closures. There’s no consensus on where in that range the actual point lies. Plus, analysts differ on whether the jobs that replaced manufacturing put the country on a better course. A quick word about trade deals. Some treaties with countries are formalized as free-trade agreements. That list includes NAFTA, CAFTA (which involved several Central American nations), South Korea, Chile -- 20 countries all told . China is a different matter. In 2000, China was granted permanent normal trade relations status. While this wasn’t a free trade deal, it eliminated potential tariff increases on goods from China and opened the door to much greater flows of investment between the two nations. For most intents and purposes, it was a trade deal. It arguably has proved the most significant. In 2014, total trade with China approached $650 billion in exports and imports, with a trade deficit of about $316 billion, larger than with any other single country. For the record, American trade with Canada was greater, $759 billion, but the trade deficit was only $7 billion. An analysis co-authored by Justin Pierce, a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve Board, and Peter Schott, a Yale economist, found that U.S. policy on China hit American jobs hard and manufacturing even harder. It reduced total employment growth by nearly 20 percentage points from 1997 to 2007 compared to a decade earlier. Among production workers, the reduction was nearly 25 percentage points. Robert Scott is an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank supported in part by unions. Scott told PunditFact that America’s trade deficit with China cost about 3.2 million jobs between 2001 and 2013. "With China, somewhere in excess of 75 percent of the jobs lost are due to trade," Scott said. Others are not so sure that trade deserves the brunt of the blame. Martin Baily, an economist at the centrist Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington, says some of the job losses stem from trade, but not all. "Part of what has happened is that there has been consolidation in the industry to take advantage of larger scale production," Baily said. "Manufacturing is changing because of technology and trade and that inevitably will lead to plant closures." One line of argument is that workers have become more productive and it takes fewer of them to produce the same goods. (Scott and others say the numbers don’t back that up.) But for Baily, one of the reasons that jobs moved overseas has less to do with trade itself and more with the appetites of American consumers. In effect, Americans wanted more things than our factories could produce, so imports grew. But as proof that all explanations are subject to debate, we found economists who argue the exact opposite. Economists Robert Z. Lawrence and Lawrence Edwards writing in the Harvard Business Review said a lack of demand led to manufacturing job losses. American factories grew too efficient, and therefore needed fewer workers to meet the needs of consumers. "Trade deficits in manufactures have played only a partial role in reducing employment—and almost no role over the past decade," they wrote. Our ruling Schultz said that more than 50,000 manufacturing factories were lost due to trade deals. His numbers are up for some interpretation, depending on how you factor in the most recent recession. The recession itself exposes a flaw in Schultz’s math in that he blames trade deals for almost all of the decline in factories. But there is no question that worldwide economic events played the dominant role after 2008. Changes of technoogy also have played a role. This statement is partially accurate but leaves out many important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Ed Schultz	None	None	None	2015-04-23T11:09:19	2015-04-17	['United_States']
pomt-03249	Says that while Foster was mayor, Rick Kriseman was "ineffective" in the Florida House of Representatives because "there was no legislation that passed the House that had (Kriseman’s) name on it."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/aug/13/bill-foster/bill-foster-says-rick-kriseman-passed-zero-bills-l/	Here’s how St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster wants voters to think of mayoral rival Rick Kriseman: As Foster got down to business at City Hall, Kriseman was lobbing partisan bombs in Tallahassee and getting nothing done. Foster used the Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 mayoral forum on Aug. 6 to go after Kriseman’s stint as a Democrat in the Florida House. "For the years that I was mayor of the city of St. Petersburg, you were up there, and there was no legislation that passed the House that had your name on it," Foster said. "You were ineffective, and it was a waste of time." We thought Foster’s claim merited more scrutiny. (In a separate fact-check we’ll consider Kriseman’s response.) Kriseman, a former St. Petersburg City Council member, was first elected to the state House in 2006. He served through the 2012 legislative session, meaning he was in Tallahassee for three of Foster’s four years as mayor -- 2010, 2011 and 2012. In each year, House rules limited Kriseman to filing, or sponsoring, six substantive bills. A search of House records shows that Foster is correct -- no bills Kriseman sponsored ultimately became law, let alone passed the House. Kriseman proposed laws banning oil drilling in Florida waters, increasing term limits for Florida House and Senate members, creating a recall provision for the governor and Cabinet offices and limiting deductions and other benefits for businesses that pay the state’s corporate income tax. Many of the bills Kriseman sponsored were never even considered in a House committee, meaning lawmakers never debated them. So yes, Kriseman was 0-for-18. But is it a sign that Kriseman was ineffective as a lawmaker? There’s no proof of that. In the Florida Legislature, Democrats are in the minority, so they have a harder time getting legislation passed. As a Democrat, Kriseman sat on one of the lowest rungs in the 120-person House. The system rewards senior Republicans, then Republicans, and then with whatever little time’s left over, maybe a Democrat or two. It doesn’t mean Democrats are unable to get bills passed -- Kriseman himself had success in 2007, for instance -- but the prospects are slim. Why? Members of the minority party in the House do not routinely chair committees, so they cannot guide legislation toward the House floor. And they do not run the House chamber, so they cannot bring up legislation for a full vote. Republicans have been the majority party in the Florida House since 1996. In 2011 and 2012, the GOP held a two-thirds majority in the House, an important threshold that allowed Republicans to completely control the legislative process. Even innocuous bills written by Democrats got hung up in the process. In an interview, Foster pointed out Kriseman’s failure to get a "no-brainer" local measure passed that would have merged the duties of the Pinellas Planning Council with the county’s Metropolitan Planning Organization. It did not budge through even one committee under Kriseman’s sponsorship, but it became law the next year when two Pinellas Republicans put their names on it. To Foster, it’s proof of Kriseman’s ineffectiveness. To Kriseman, it’s proof of one committee chairman’s influence. "That year, very few local bills passed. (Rep.) Ritch Workman was killing everyone’s local bills," Kriseman said. "The chances of the minority member’s bill passing is slim to none," said Mike Fasano, a Republican who served both in the House and Senate and was recently appointed Pasco County tax collector. The mechanics are different in the state Senate where a smaller number of lawmakers, 40, allows for more collaboration, he said. One more point: getting a bill signed by the governor is difficult for most everyone in the House, Republican or Democrat. In 2011, lawmakers filed 1,850 general bills. Only 245 passed both the House and Senate, and a handful of them were vetoed by Gov. Rick Scott. Kriseman described the dynamics in the House during an interview with the Times/Herald in 2011. "If you go into the session with the understanding that your bills are dead," he said, "you will be free to speak your mind and vote how you feel like you need to vote because they can't do anything to you." Part of his job was working "to make bad bills better," Kriseman said, pointing to a 2009 telecommunications bill sponsored by Rep. Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel. Kriseman voted against it throughout the session but voted for it on the floor after substantial changes were made, which he said he worked out with Weatherford. Weatherford, by the way, passed no bills in the two years before he became House speaker. Our ruling Foster claimed that Kriseman failed to get legislation passed in the House from 2010-2012 and that Kriseman was ineffective as a result. We’re not passing judgment on whether Kriseman was good or bad at his job. But we were unable to find a direct correlation between Kriseman’s inability to get a bill passed during Foster’s timeframe and his effectiveness as a lawmaker. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02634	"Today, our unemployment rate is 7.8 percent. That is the lowest in five years."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2014/jan/19/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-states-jobless-rate-lowest-5/	New Jersey’s jobs picture is improving so much that the state’s steadily declining unemployment rate is the lowest its been since before Gov. Chris Christie took office. That’s one of several jobs claims the Republican governor made Tuesday during his State of the State address in Trenton. "Today, our unemployment rate is 7.8 percent. That is the lowest in five years," the governor said before touting gains in private-sector job growth that the Truth-O-Meter has previously rated as True and Mostly True. Although New Jersey’s unemployment stagnated in the mid-to-high 9-percent range for the better part of Christie’s first term, the governor’s claim is not entirely accurate. First, we’ll look at the state’s unemployment rate by reviewing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the state’s Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Both agencies note that New Jersey’s unemployment rate as of November – the most recent month for which data is available – was 7.8 percent. So Christie’s figure is correct. To put that rate in context, it’s the highest in a region that also includes New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Delaware. Eight other states, however, had an even higher unemployment rate in November than New Jersey. Still, New Jersey’s unemployment rate has been declining steadily since for the past year. The rate, which had been stuck in the 9 percent range from June 2009 through March 2013, finally dipped below 8 percent in November. Getting back to Christie’s claim, we went back exactly five years from the November 2013 unemployment rate to review data from November 2008, onward, to fit his cited timeframe. We found that New Jersey’s unemployment rate was 6.5 percent in November 2008, 7 percent in December 2008, and 7.4 percent in January 2009 – lower than the current 7.8 percent. So Christie’s claim is off a bit – the state’s unemployment rate has been lower within the past five years than the current rate of 7.8 percent. But Christie’s claim is accurate beyond those three months. The state’s unemployment rate jumped to 7.9 percent in February 2009 and continued climbing until it topped out at 9.7 percent that December. The rate stayed that high until April 2010, when it began a slow downward trend. New Jersey’s unemployment rate finally dipped below 9 percent in April 2013 and below 8 percent in November. Christie spokesman Colin Reed said in an email that the administration expects to have a new unemployment data report this week. Our ruling Christie said during his State of the State address, "Today, our unemployment rate is 7.8 percent. That is the lowest in five years." Federal and state labor data confirm that New Jersey’s unemployment rate is 7.8 percent as of November 2013, the most recent month for which data is available. Although New Jersey’s unemployment rate has exceeded 9 percent for much of Christie’s tenure, the fact is that federal and state data both confirm that the unemployment rate was lower than 7.8 percent for the first three months of Christie’s five-year timeframe. We rate the governor’s claim Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2014-01-19T07:30:00	2014-01-14	['None']
pomt-03544	"To hear Gov. Christie tell it, everything in New Jersey is going just fine. Well I see another New Jersey with 400,000 unemployed. One of the worst jobless rates in the country. Working and middle class families have seen costs soar, from property taxes to college tuition."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/26/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-tv-ad-goes-after-chris-christie-jobs/	Depending on who’s asked, everything in Jersey is just dandy or the state is on the brink of economic disaster. And the first TV campaign ad from likely Democratic gubernatorial nominee Barbara Buono is clear about where she stands. "To hear Gov. Christie tell it, everything in New Jersey is going just fine," Buono claims in the ad released online Wednesday. "Well I see another New Jersey with 400,000 unemployed. One of the worst jobless rates in the country. Working and middle class families have seen costs soar, from property taxes to college tuition." The degree of accuracy for some of these claims is mixed and in some cases, significant details are missing. Let’s tackle the claims about unemployment and joblessness first. The ad is correct that New Jersey has about 400,000 people unemployed, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for April 2013. Not mentioned? That figure is more than 42,000 fewer unemployed since Christie’s first full month in office, Feburary 2010, BLS data shows. In the ad Buono says that New Jersey has one of the worst jobless rates in the country, but text in the ad also claims the state ranks 44th nationwide in job creation. We’ll look at both. In terms of unemployment rates as of April, only six states have higher rates than New Jersey’s 8.7 percent: California (9%), Illinois (9.3%), Mississippi (9.1%), Nevada (9.6%), North Carolina (8.9%) and Rhode Island (8.8%). If we measure jobs in all 50 states and Washington, DC from February 2010 to February 2013, New Jersey ranks 21st for job creation, according to BLS data. But from December 2010 to December 2011, the state ranks near the bottom, in 48th place. So New Jersey fares better in job creation when we look at broader time frames. Economic experts from both the Economic Analysis and Research Network at the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, and Georgetown University, have told us that year-over-year comparisons are very common ways to evaluate employment trends. Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner could not be reached for comment about what timeframe the campaign used to determine New Jersey’s 44th place ranking for job creation, or other concerns we had about the ad. Now let’s look at property taxes and tuition costs. Buono is right that working and middle class families have seen costs soar, but what she doesn’t say is that those increases started long before Christie got to the governor’s office. The ad cites an article from the online web site NJ Spotlight, which claims property taxes increased nearly 19 percent during Christie’s first three years in office compared with his predecessor Democrat Jon Corzine’s final three years in office. One of the reasons: Christie severely curtailed rebate payments and limited eligibility for certain tax cut programs. And while those rebate program limitations may have caused tax increases, property taxes in New Jersey were rising before Corzine became governor. In fact, we determined in previous fact-checks that property taxes spiked about 70 percent across three Democratic administrations in the first decade of the 2000s. Finally, let’s look at college tuition costs. Christie cut funding for county colleges by 10 percent in 2010, a year that also saw record enrollment increases at the state’s two-year schools. As a result, tuition increased an average of 4.4 percent. Tuition and fees at 24 of the state’s four-year colleges and universities also rose faster than the rate of inflation in 2010, according to a Star-Ledger analysis that year. "Barbara Buono has relied exclusively on negative campaigning and misleading attacks because she simply doesn't want to talk about her own record of voting 154 times for higher taxes and fees, property taxes that doubled on New Jersey families on her watch, and 240,000 private sector jobs lost," Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts said in an e-mail. "She opposes the Governor's bipartisan, middle-class tax relief plan and has consistently stood against reforms to lower the cost of government and deliver real savings to property taxpayers, and even to strengthen higher education for the future." Our ruling A new Buono TV ad claims, "To hear Gov. Christie tell it, everything in New Jersey is going just fine. Well I see another New Jersey with 400,000 unemployed. One of the worst jobless rates in the country. Working and middle class families have seen costs soar, from property taxes to college tuition." Buono is right that nearly 400,000 New Jerseyans are out of work, but fewer people are unemployed now than when Christie became governor. Also, the state is faring better in job creation when employment gains are analyzed across the bulk of Christie’s time in office. Property taxes and college tuition have both soared, as the ad claims, but we can’t ignore how much property taxes skyrocketed across three Democratic administrations prior to Christie’s. Still, the governor’s aid cuts in 2010 to help close budget gaps resulted in higher tuition at two-year and four-year schools in the state. There are degrees of accuracy here, but given the significant context issues with this ad we rate it Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-11927	"The president early on called on NATO member countries to step up their contributions ... and as a result of that countries have stepped up contributions toward their own defense."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/15/rex-tillerson/tillerson-says-trumps-rhetoric-has-led-increase-de/	President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized allies for not meeting NATO defense spending targets, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it’s already made a difference. "The president early on called on NATO member countries to step up their contributions — step up their commitment to NATO, modernize their own forces," Tillerson said on CNN’s State of the Union on Oct. 15. "He’s been very clear, and as a result of that countries have stepped up contributions toward their own defense." We wondered if NATO countries have stepped up defense contributions and whether the step was a result of pressure from Trump. We found that 25 NATO allies plan to increase spending in real terms in 2017, according to official NATO statistics released in June. But there are many factors at play that have contributed to the increase — not just Trump’s urging. Countries’ defense spending has increased for the past 3 years There are 29 members of NATO, formally the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was created in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. NATO leaders reached a collective agreement in 2014 that directed members to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending by 2024. As of June 2017, only five counties met that obligation: the United States, Greece, Estonia, Poland and the United Kingdom. (In 2017, the United States has spent about 3.6 percent of its GDP on defense.) However, the latest data from NATO shows that 25 countries plan to step up spending in 2017. NATO expects Romania to meet the 2 percent threshold this year, and Latvia and Lithuania to reach it by 2018. It's also worth noting that all NATO members have been asked to submit national plans on increasing defense spending by the end of this year. Other countries since 2014 have been contributing more to their defense, even if they are not at the 2 percent mark. At a June 29 press conference, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that 2017 marks the third consecutive year of increasing defense investment across European allies and Canada, adding that there has been "an increase of almost $46 billion U.S. dollars more for defense since 2015." The "Trump administration's rhetoric on defense spending has put pressure on NATO allies to continue the upward trajectory," said Jeffrey Rathke, a senior fellow and deputy director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Experts said the trend really started in earnest after the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin after 2014. Specifically, the Russian invasion of Crimea and Russian-backed fighting in eastern Ukraine galvanized countries to focus on their territorial defense capabilities at this time. At the Wales Summit Declaration in 2014, members of NATO pledged to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of their gross domestic products by 2024. So some of the increase in defense spending was decided before Trump took office. Stephen M. Saideman, an international relations professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, pointed to the situation in Canada as an example. He said Canada’s defense policy review was mostly completed before the 2016 American election. "They might have changed some of the numbers, but the biggest driver of the big increase in future spending (not in 2017 but down the road) has been the commitment to build 15 frigates/destroyers despite increased costs —and that is mostly due to political competition for votes in Halifax/Vancouver, not Trump pressure," he said. Since becoming president, there’s no doubt Trump has done several things to persuade NATO leaders to get their defense commitments up to the alliance's standard. But Trump was not the first president to call for a step up in defense spending. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama called for increased spending by countries on defense. The difference is Trump has made the issue a major point at almost all NATO-related discussions. Christopher A. Preble, the vice president for Defense and Foreign Policy Studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, said it’s possible countries have stepped up spending to protect themselves from the possibility that the president might not fulfill obligations made under the NATO treaty. In the past, Trump has questioned defending other countries from attack if they don't spend what he considers to be their fair share. "They are beginning to question the wisdom of subcontracting their security to a third party over whom they have no control," he said. Our ruling Tillerson said that NATO countries are contributing more to their defense as a result of pressure from Trump. According to NATO, over the last 3 years, European allies and Canada spent almost $46 billion more on defense, meaning increases in spending have occurred before Trump’s presidency. Experts said it’s possible that Trump’s pressure has contributed to the continuation of the upward trend, but Tillerson’s explanation glazes over the other factors that have led to increases, including the conflict in the Ukraine in 2014.

pomt-13315	"In other states (where illegal immigrants have been allowed to get driver's licenses) their insurance premiums for everybody have gone down."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/07/gina-raimondo/limited-data-support-gina-raimondos-claim-motorist/	In the battle over how to deal with immigrants who are in the United States illegally, one skirmish involves the question of whether those immigrants should be allowed to have a driver's license. Rhode Island is one state wrestling with the issue, and during a Sept. 28 interview with Gov. Gina Raimondo, WJAR-TV anchorman Dan Jaehnig conveyed a viewer question challenging Raimondo's support for immigrant licenses. "There's actually many, many people who are in favor of that and many against," Raimondo said. "The reason I support it, as more than a dozen states already have it, is, to me, it's a public safety issue. I want everybody on the roads of Rhode Island to have a license. And I want everybody, if they're in an accident, to have a license and insurance. When you see that, actually, in other states their insurance premiums for everybody have gone down. That's why I'm a supporter of it." We wondered whether Raimondo was correct that states that have granted licenses to illegal immigrants have seen automobile insurance premiums decrease for everyone. James Lynch, chief actuary for the Insurance Information Institute, an educational organization financed by the insurance industry, said he's never seen any definitive studies to prove or disprove the idea. "There is a logic behind that, though," he said. If allowing undocumented immigrants to get a license and requiring them to have insurance produces a big drop in the percentage of uninsured motorists, "that would reduce the uninsured motorist premium." But so many factors go into adjusting rates "it would be difficult to pinpoint it and say that's what's going on" if rates drop in a state that allows undocumented immigrants to get a license, Lynch said. Benefit of $17 per policy? Raimondo's office subsequently referred us to a 2015 study published in the Southern Economic Journal. It didn't directly look at whether insurance rates go down when licenses are granted, but it tried to estimate the costs of denying licenses to undocumented immigrants. Using data covering 14 years from 41 states, the authors estimated that denying licenses to people in the country illegally adds $17.22 to an insurance bill. To put that in perspective, the average automobile insurance policy in the United States in 2013 cost $841.23 per year, according to the latest data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. A savings of $17.22 would amount to a 2 percent drop. (It would be about 1.6 percent in Rhode Island where the average policy cost $1,066, the eighth highest in the nation.) But that's far from a firm number, said co-author Kenneth Jameson, professor emeritus at the University of Utah economics department. It will vary by state, and "the main factor is the share of undocumented immigrants in the total population," he said. Another driver of savings, if any, will be the median age of the immigrants getting licenses and insurance. Adding younger drivers bumps up insurance costs because young adults are more likely to get into accidents. But Raimondo's claim "is consistent with what our data would suggest," said Jameson. "Our results suggest that insurance rates should be dampened in the 10 states that are newly allowing undocumented to drive legally," Jameson and his colleague write. "In a few years, a new empirical investigation can ascertain whether, over time, the new wave of legalizing undocumented driving has held down insurance costs in the liberalizing states." Other estimates Another analysis was done by the Colorado Fiscal Institute, which supports letting illegal immigrants get a license. It estimated last year that the state's drivers could see a $29.5 million savings in insurance premiums each year once the law was fully funded. That would be $7.70 per motorist saved per year. And in 2007 when Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced that New York would begin issuing driver's licenses without regard to immigration status, the state's Department of Insurance was estimating that the change would save drivers $120 million per year because costs associated with uninsured motorists would drop by 34 percent. With roughly 11.6 million drivers, that would be a savings of about $10 for each driver each year. (However, Spitzer never implemented the policy.) Although there's uncertainty in the estimates of how much is saved by letting illegal immigrants get licenses and insurance, there's firmer data on how it affects the number of uninsured drivers. According to the Colorado Fiscal Institute, in New Mexico the ratio of uninsured vehicles on the road dropped from 33 percent in 2002 to 9.1 percent in 2011. And the National Immigration Law Center reported in 2008 that when Utah changed its policy in 1999, its rate of uninsured motorists, which was 10 percent in 1998, had fallen to 5.1 percent in 2007. The National Conference of State Legislatures lists 12 states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Vermont and Washington — along with the District of Columbia that issue licenses to unauthorized immigrants. Our ruling Raimondo said that in states where illegal immigrants have been allowed to get driver's licenses, the "insurance premiums for everybody have gone down." The few studies that have been done have estimated that there is a savings. In addition, the experts we spoke with also say there's good reason to believe that the savings, albeit small, will be real. But the research on this is scattered and far from definitive. As such, we rate the claim Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7d458c31-9ca0-4ff9-916b-7e45b7949caf	None	Gina Raimondo	None	None	None	2016-10-07T09:45:00	2016-09-28	['None']
pomt-04224	Says the tax code is effectively subsidizing "the marketing efforts of fast food and junk food companies by as much as $19 billion over 10 years."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/26/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-says-tax-code-effectively-subsidiz/	Dennis Kucinich became a lame-duck member of Congress after the 10th District he has represented since 1997 was redrawn out of existence and he lost a primary contest to another sitting Democrat, Marcy Kaptur, in the new Ohio 9th District. But Kucinich has not stopped working on the issues that have engaged him. He issued a news release and video on Nov. 2 supporting HR 4310, the bill he introduced to "end the childhood obesity subsidy." "Congress -- with your tax dollars -- subsidizes the marketing efforts of fast food and junk food companies by as much as $19 billion over 10 years," thereby "subsidizing the childhood obesity epidemic," he said. Do fast food and junk food companies really enjoy an advertising subsidy? PolitiFact Ohio decided to dig in. Kucinich builds his case first by noting that childhood obesity -- which has more than tripled in the past 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- has been linked to the influence of targeted marketing, though "partial blame does lie with a more sedentary lifestyle and a worsening diet." He cites several prominent studies in support, with the most recent study coming from the Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences. It says: "Aggressive marketing of high-calorie foods to children and adolescents has been identified as one of the major contributors to childhood obesity." (Others with the same conclusion included the American Heart Association, the American Journal of Public Health and the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University.) Kucinich's bill would prohibit any company from claiming a tax deduction for the expense of marketing that is directed at children "to promote the consumption of food at fast food restaurants or of food of poor nutritional quality." Under current law, fast food marketers get the same break that other businesses do. The federal tax code allows companies to deduct "reasonable and necessary" expenses of marketing and advertising from their income taxes. How is that a subsidy? "The way the federal funding system works," Kucinich said, "is that if we give a tax break in one place, we need to replace that lost income from somewhere else, like with higher taxes from the rest of us. In other words, this tax break is a massive subsidy for the junk food and fast food industry." The question then is how much the deduction, or tax break, is worth. According to a report to Congress from the Federal Trade Commission, the most recent we could find, the fast food industry spent nearly $2 billion in 2006 on marketing and advertising specifically aimed at children. That would yield about $700 million in tax revenue at the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent. A report in the New England Journal of Medicine put the marketing budgets for "kids' foods" at $10 billion annually -- which would yield $3.5 billion in revenue. A study in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity said "it It is unclear how much money is spent on food advertising specifically directed at children and adolescents," but put the total for advertising, youth-targeted promotions and public relations and packaging especially designed for children at $10.5 billion. The Economic Policy Institute estimated 10-year tax savings of $15 billion through legislation to "end subsidies for junk and fast food advertising to children to promote health." Kucinich relied on Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which estimated "on a very preliminary basis" that his legislation could raise $15 billion to $19 billion in additional federal revenue over the 10-year budget period. That is as much as $19 billion, as Kucinich asserted, though the committee also noted that unsettled issues surrounding his bill would affect its impact and the revenue it would raise. Those issues primarily include defining "fast food" and determining what advertising is "primarily directed at children." What's our take-home? PolitiFact examined Kucinich's legislation two years ago, when he made a statement about it that we found relied too firmly on a high-end estimate of its potential tax saving and implied a direct cash payout by taxpayers to the food industry. He chose his words more carefully this time. His assertion that the tax code provides a subsidy of "as much as $19 billion" needs additional information for clarification, but it is well supported. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly True.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2012-11-26T06:00:00	2012-11-02	['None']
pomt-08137	"It’s illegal for a state to say we’re simply going to cut off (union contract) negotiations. There’s a legal requirement that you are involved in good faith bargaining."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/07/jim-doyle/wisconsin-gov-jim-doyle-says-it-would-be-illegal-s/	The campaign to convince outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle and Democratic lawmakers to relinquish control of contract negotiations with state employee unions to Governor-elect Scott Walker has been marked by plenty of political maneuvering. But Doyle recently said it’s all about the law, not politics. Soon after winning the Nov. 2, 2010 election, Walker sent Doyle’s administration a letterasking to suspend the negotiations, citing state budget troubles. Walker takes office Jan. 3. At a Marquette University Law School appearance Nov. 30, 2010, journalist Mike Gousha asked Doyle why he hadn’t stopped. Said Doyle: "It’s illegal for a state to say we’re simply going to cut off negotiations. There’s a legal requirement that you are involved in good faith bargaining." Doyle’s declaration elicited howls of protest from his critics, and a spirited defense from his supporters. We wondered: Is it all as cut and dried as Doyle described it? We asked Doyle’s office for support for his claim -- and were directed right back to the session with Gousha, a distinguished fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University. Doyle, a lawyer and former state attorney general, did lay out his general reasoning in the interview: Refusal to bargain would be a violation of state labor law -- especially when unions had taken a renewed interest in accepting a concessions-laden two-year deal some 18 months after their last contract expired. "A governor cannot say … I am walking away from the bargaining table," Doyle said in the interview. "How would I say, ‘We’ve been offering you this package for the last 18 months and now we’re taking that package off the table; sorry, you can’t have it.’ " Doyle didn’t spell it out, but the union’s interest in finalizing the contracts apparently flared up as it became clear that Walker -- who campaigned on getting more concessions from state employees -- would succeed Doyle. That political reality no doubt drove the union to action, a variety of public, private and academic officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Let’s hear from them. But first, a word of warning: While Doyle asserted his statement as fact, the experts we consulted said getting at the truth of it is tough because the situation -- from the politics to the timing -- is unprecedented. Then there’s that notoriously vague legal definition of "good faith bargaining." And the fact what was said at the bargaining table -- central to any potential legal ruling -- is private. Let’s start with Walker’s initial Nov. 10 request that "all contract negotiations be suspended." As worded, that suggests a unilateral move on the part of the state, not a request to seek the consent of unions to hit the pause button. Had that happened, it certainly would have prompted an unfair labor practices complaint, according to lawyers who represent labor unions. Why the certainty? For one thing, walking away from negotiations would have been a rare -- and perhaps unprecedented -- move. Peter Davis, general counsel at the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, said he knew of no instance where an employer or union has pulled out of talks since the implementation of the 1971 State Employment Labor Relations Act, which governs labor practices. Davis has worked at the commission since 1975. Another thing is clear: All of our experts agreed a refusal to negotiate with a recognized collective bargaining unit -- the union -- is indeed an unfair labor practice under the state law. The rub: What constitutes an unlawful "refusal to negotiate?" Would a seven-week delay -- from early November until after inauguration day -- fit that definition? Answering that gets tricky. Some lawyers say such a delay would stand a good chance of violating the law. Perhaps most notable among them is David Vergeront, who was the chief legal counsel in the Office of State Employment Relations for 13 years until he retired last summer. That state office negotiates state labor contracts. Vergeront told us the union could make a "very good" case the delay was a refusal to bargain. But it would not be a "slam dunk," he said. Marquette University labor law expert Paul Secunda agreed. He said suspending talks would have left the state vulnerable -- although proving illegality is hard. Marianne Robbins, another experienced attorney for labor unions, said Doyle would have violated good faith if he had walked. "You’re the man right now," she said of Doyle. "You’ve got the authority right now, and if you’re not willing to meet, then you don’t want to reach an agreement and you’re not bargaining in good faith." Attorneys who represent the management side see it differently. Daniel Vliet and James Scott said a delay of a couple months would not have constituted a violation. Said Vliet: "I think he could have stopped on this one." Lawyers on both sides agreed the state could walk away lawfully by citing an emergency change in circumstances. But the consensus was that it would have to be a major change. Examples they provided: In the private sector, a manufacturing plant burns down. In the public sector, a massive new financial problem is revealed. Walker’s early November letter made only a general reference to "the state’s fiscal condition." He apparently meant the estimated $3 billion looming in the next two-year budget period, but did not say so explicitly. Lawyers said the state would need to prove a deterioration in state finances in recent months to have a chance at justifying a halt to talks. Top labor lawyers on both the union and management side said Davis -- the lawyer for the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, the state agency that rules on labor disputes -- was in the best position to address this scenario. Since the commission could be asked to rule in the Doyle-Walker dispute, if it escalates, Davis could offer only a general thought: It would have been irresponsible for Doyle, given the spirit of the labor law, to tell union leaders he was just going to pass the baton to Walker. "The fact there is new sheriff coming into town would likely not be a sufficient basis for saying ‘We’re stopping,’ " Davis said. "It would be akin to a governor saying, ‘I lost that election, but I’m going to Bora Bora for the next couple months.’ " Of course, irresponsible is different than the "unlawful" that Doyle asserted. Another factor is what agreements were in place at the time. Doyle spokesperson Adam Collins said at the point Walker made his request two state employee unions already had reached tentative deals -- and one of those deals already had been ratified by union members. Fifteen other unions were still in talks. Any tentative deals in place would have been legally problematic to walk away from, our experts said. It is unclear whether Doyle received any legal advice that said a suspension of talks would be unlawful. Collins suggested that Doyle -- a former attorney general -- was perfectly capable of reading the law. They declined to provide anyone to PolitiFact Wisconsin who could add more details from inside the talks, such as the state labor negotiator or attorneys who directly advise him. Finally, a bit of history. In late 2002, Doyle’s predecessor, Republican Gov. Scott McCallum, negotiated a deal with a big state labor union right before leaving office. Doyle cites that now as proof that deals have come together in the past under governors on the verge of leaving office. In the 2002 case, McCallum and the lawmakers left it to the next Legislature and a just-sworn-in Doyle to handle the deals. Republicans objected to the substance of the contracts and a major fight broke out. Such a scenario could play out again. Or Doyle and the outgoing Democratic-controlled Legislature will rush to ratify the labor deals -- which Walker and Republicans could attempt to undo after Jan. 3. That’s the politics part of all this. But let’s come back to the legal question: In making his claim, Doyle asserts that it would be unlawful for him to suspend bargaining with the state’s labor unions. Experts generally say there is a good chance such a step would be considered a refusal to bargain but acknowledge the scenario is unprecedented. The state could stop negotiations in the face of an emergency, experts say, but the deficit may not qualify. It’s big, but that problem was looming for months -- and accounted for with deals that reportedly have no pay increases. The Truth-O-Meter puts the burden of proof on the speaker. In this case, the weight of the available evidence may tilt toward Doyle, but he offers few specifics -- on his own or from his lawyers -- to address the many points that would clarify things even further. And there was plenty of context missing in his flat assertion of unlawfulness. We rate Doyle’s claim Half True.	None	Jim Doyle	None	None	None	2010-12-07T09:00:00	2010-11-30	['None']
pomt-13014	Alison Alter "has exploited a campaign finance loophole to obtain over $64,000 in public dollars to fund her campaign."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/dec/08/sheri-gallo/sheri-gallo-says-alison-alter-landed-64000-runoff-/	Seeking re-election, Austin City Council Member Sheri Gallo says in a mailer to voters in West Austin’s District 10 that challenger Alison Alter "exploited a campaign loophole to obtain over $64,000 in public dollars to fund her campaign." Alter, a philanthropic adviser making her first bid for office, received $64,171.19 in public financing toward her runoff campaign after placing second in November’s general election. She received the money as a reward for agreeing to comply with the city’s voluntary campaign spending limits, including not spending more than $75,000 during the general election. So, did Alter, who faces Gallo on the Dec. 13 ballot, draw that money fair and square? Alter’s campaign finance reports filed before the general election indicated that she did, and the city clerk cut the check. But an additional Alter campaign finance filing posted Dec. 5, 2016 — after Gallo's mailer went out — show that Alter exceeded the limit. Either way, Gallo told us by email, a "loophole" in the city's rules allowed Alter to get the public aid without having to meet those campaign finance limits because Gallo didn’t commit to the limits. "Ms. Alter," Gallo wrote, "agreed to abide by the restrictions, knowing full well that she would not have to follow those restrictions." Let’s look at the roots of Austin’s campaign finance ordinances and then into how Alter drew the money. Voluntary limits adopted in 1994 The city’s public campaign finance system, the Austin Fair Campaign Ordinance, won council approval in October 1994. At the time, advocates said limits on donation amounts and voluntary spending restrictions — which could lead to freshets of money for compliant candidates who made into runoffs — would enable more people to run. Council members voted to raise money for the runoff pool, the Austin Fair Campaign Finance Fund, from lobbyist registration fees. Under the system, mayoral candidates volunteer to spend no more than $120,000 in a general election or more than $80,000 in a runoff; for City Council candidates, the limits are $75,000 in the general election and $50,000 in a runoff. The ordinance also imposes specific limits on personal loans by candidates and contributions from political action committees and donors who live outside the city. In exchange, the pot of public funding — paid for by those lobby fees, fines for campaign finance violations and donations — is to be divvied up among the candidates who agree to comply and also advance to a runoff. If no candidates agree to the program, or if none who did make it to a runoff, the accumulated money rolls over, like unused minutes on a cell phone plan. The 2016 elections Before the 2016 elections, three council candidates agreed to ‘Fair Campaign’ restrictions: District 2 candidate Wesley Faulkner, who lost to incumbent Delia Garza; District 7 incumbent Leslie Pool, who won outright; and Alter. As the sole candidate in a runoff who signed the pledge, Alter drew all $64,000 in available aid. Alter’s campaign spending So, did Alter adhere to the program’s requirements or did she find a way around them? On Nov. 22, 2016, Alter’s campaign got the $64,000 check at issue after the City Clerk’s office determined it complied with the finance limits. Under the ordinance, the clerk reviews the most recent campaign finance reports available. In this instance, those reports covered donations and expenditures up to 10 days before the general election. And through that time, Alter reported raising $10,886 from donors outside of the city, less than the $36,000 cap; garnering $900 from non-individuals, under the $24,000 cap on donations from political action committees; and she’d reported spending $61,556.74, which was short of the $75,000 spending cap for the general election. Also, Alter had ponied up $563.67 in personal funds, less than the $3,750 cap. A full accounting of Alter’s pre-election spending would not be possible until the campaign finance reports for the runoff were filed. That Alter campaign filing--submitted Dec. 5, 2016, after the check was cut and Gallo’s fliers began hitting mailboxes--showed that Alter spent $80,000 in the general election, exceeding the $75,000 voluntary spending cap by nearly 7 percent. A city official We wondered what recourse the city had if such a situation arose. By phone to our inquiry, a city spokesman, Bryce Bencivengo, said the clerk’s office checks that later finance report and could find Alter’s campaign in violation. But, Bencivengo said, the ordinance contains no language directing the city what to do next. However, Bencivengo advised, the rules allowed Alter to remain eligible for the runoff money, even if she exceeded the spending limit, if her opponent didn’t participate in the public financing system. Per the city code, because Gallo did not commit to the voluntary limits, Alter could draw the runoff funds whether she abided or not. Previous candidates who signed pledge Gallo’s mention of Alter exploiting a loophole reminded us that in spring 2011, Place 3 Council Member Randi Shade made a similar claim about challenger Kathie Tovo, who landed $64,129 from the city for their runoff despite failing to comply with the voluntary city spending limits. Shade suggested Tovo never intended to abide by the spending limits because she loaned her campaign $53,000 -- much more than the $3,750 limit on personal loans -- after signing the pledge. Tovo, who won that runoff, responded she'd followed the spirit and letter of the law, and didn't know when she signed the pledge how much runoff money was in the fund. "The intent of the (program) is to level the playing field among candidates, especially if -- like me -- you're running against a well-funded incumbent," Tovo said. In 2014, much the same situation replayed when then-District 7 candidate Leslie Pool signed the pledge, but then loaned her campaign nearly 10 times the allowed amount. Like Tovo in 2011 and Alter in 2016, Pool could legally exceed the limit because other candidates didn’t pledge to heed it. Our ruling Gallo said Alter "has exploited a campaign finance loophole to obtain over $64,000 in public dollars to fund her campaign." Gallo couldn’t have known when she sent her mailers that Alter ultimately exceeded the spending limit she’d pledged to meet. But under city rules, Alter qualified for the runoff money anyway, as Gallo noted, because Gallo hadn’t committed to the same finance restrictions. Was that a loophole? We find that reasonably debatable. We rate Gallo’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-13578	"We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/19/donald-trump/trump-says-us-admits-100000-permanent-immigrants-a/	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump promises his administration would be tough on immigration. He would temporarily suspend immigration from regions with a "history of exporting terrorism" and call for "extreme vetting" of people who want to come to the United States, Trump said Aug. 15 in Youngstown, Ohio. He raised concerns over the amount of people already coming in. "The size of current immigration flows are too large to perform adequate screening," Trump said. "We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year." Trump's comment about the adequacy of the vetting system is an opinion. But we wanted to look at his concerns and separately fact-check whether the country is taking 100,000 "permanent immigrants" a year from the Middle East. Trump’s campaign did not get back to us about his comment. But his prepared speech cites a November 2015 post from the House Homeland Security Committee. It lists comments about refugees from war-torn Syria said by national security officials, including directors of the FBI, CIA and National Counterterrorism Center. The quotes share similar themes: Officials don’t have all the intelligence they’d like to have on Syrians, there’s concern that terrorist organizations may try to sneak people in as refugees, and rigorous screening must be applied to those who want to come in. But the officials’ comments, which Trump’s campaign references in the speech footnotes, are specifically about Syrian refugees, a small fraction of immigrants. Trump’s comment on "the size of current immigration flow" is broad and followed by a reference to Middle East "permanent" immigrants. President Barack Obama’s administration plans to accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees over the course of this fiscal year (Oct 1., 2015 to Sept. 30, 2016). So far, at least 8,000 have been admitted. FBI Director James Comey has been misinterpreted by some political candidates as saying we cannot vet refugees at all. Comey has also said that while it is harder to check Syrians compared to Iraqis, the vetting process has "improved dramatically." Refugees are admitted into the country after a process that usually takes one to two years. It includes interviews, medical checks and screening by agencies such as the FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and State Department. Syrians and other refugees from the Middle East are also subjected to iris scans. Immigration officials have defended the process and resources available. Hundreds of applicants, including Syrians, have been denied admission to the United States as a result of information found on databases, Leon Rodriguez, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director, said Aug. 5. Trump’s estimate for Middle Eastern immigrants is more broad than just Syria. Footnotes in Trump’s speech cite a Breitbart article (a conservative site whose leader Stephen Bannon recently stepped down, temporarily, to become Trump’s campaign CEO) that says "from 2001 to 2013 the U.S. admitted more than 1.5 million lawful permanent residents from majority-Muslims nations." The article doesn’t specify which countries of origin were considered. Many countries in the Middle East-North Africa region are "heavily Muslim," but the region "is home to only about 20 percent of the world’s Muslims," according to Pew Research Center. The Department of Homeland Security publishes an annual Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, which includes how many people during a fiscal year get lawful permanent residence. That number reflects newcomers as well people already in the country. In fiscal 2014, a total of 1,016,518 people were granted lawful permanent residency. About 47 percent were new arrivals, and 53 percent became permanent residents as an adjustment of status. By tallying numbers from 21 countries in the Middle East region and with importance to United States’ Middle East policy (such as Libya in north Africa), nearly 105,000 people were granted permanent residency in fiscal 2014. Between 2005 and 2014 (years provided in the 2014 yearbook), the annual average was 88,088. By stricter definitions of the Middle East region (leaving out places such as Turkey and Pakistan) in fiscal 2014, about 70,000 got lawful permanent residence. And an average of 61,477 between 2005 and 2014. So Trump’s estimate is a bit too high. Still, the current vetting process of immigrants "can certainly be criticized as inadequate and overwhelmed," said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter immigration. He gave two examples of vetting failures. There’s the case of Pakistani woman Tashfeen Malik, who along with her husband killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. last year. Rep. Bob Goodlatte , R-Va., has said immigration officials did not sufficiently vet Malik’s fiancee visa application. Also, Waad Ramadan Alwan, an Iraqi citizen living in Kentucky sentenced in 2013 to serve in federal prison for terrorist activities. Alwan migrated through a refugee program, exposing "an alarming gap in the screening process," national security experts told NPR. Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School, said it’s always possible a national security threat could get through, but it is less likely now than before 2001. For the procedures to work, he said, the United States needs adequate personnel. Our ruling In a speech in Ohio, Trump said, "We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year." By a broad measure of which countries are part of the Middle East, Trump is close to the number of new green card holders during fiscal 2014, though the average from 2005 to 2014 was 88,088. By stricter regional parameters, about 70,000 got green cards in fiscal year 2014.

pomt-14854	The United States is "the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/15/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-us-only-major-country-doesnt-g/	During the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Bernie Sanders returned to a health-care talking point that he has used often. In fact, he made it more than once in the debate. "I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege," Sanders said. This is virtually identical to a statement by Sanders that we checked in June 2015. We’ll recap our research here. When we looked at the claim before, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Sanders, said the senator was referring to nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We’re not sure Sanders made that entirely clear (for instance the OECD doesn’t include China or Russia, which many people would consider a major country), but we’ll put that aside for the moment. Briggs directed us to a 2014 OECD report that found only two member countries, the United States and Mexico, lacking universal health care coverage. "However, Mexico passed a law in 2004 with the goal of establishing universal coverage, and they're currently at 90 percent," Briggs said. "The ACA was never intended to establish universal coverage, and according to the January CBO estimate, 90 percent is about as good as it's going to get." We checked and Briggs is close on his numbers. In Mexico, as of 2013, public insurance reached about 86.7 percent of the people. That’s actually not much different from where America stood, if you combine public and private coverage. The figure in the United States was 84.9 percent. However, in 2015, the CBO estimated that 89 percent of American residents -- excluding undocumented immigrants -- have coverage. The number drops to 87 percent if you include undocumented residents. The median income in Mexico is so low -- about a third of that in the United States -- that some would not group it with the stronger OECD countries. But since Sanders’ spokesman included it, we thought it only fair to include it, too. Beyond the raw numbers, Sanders’ statement highlights the tricky questions that come up when you start talking about a right to health care. Is it defined as universal coverage, or a legal right to care? The two are not identical. The gold standard Europe covers both bases. Nearly every European nation has signed and ratified the European Social Charter. That treaty’s section on health care casts coverage as a right. "The system of health care must be accessible to the entire population. To that end, states should take as their main criterion for judging the success of health system reforms effective access to health care for all, without discrimination, as a basic human right." Countries follow different paths to make good on that promise. Great Britain has its national health service where the government runs the hospitals and pays the doctors and nurses. Germany and France have a more complicated mix of highly regulated public and private insurance companies, and, as in America, a law that makes insurance mandatory for everyone. Those European nations score 100 when it comes to universal coverage. But so does Australia, and Australia operates under no legal claim that health care is a right. The government’s Attorney General’s Department posted on its website "there is no Commonwealth legislation explicitly enshrining the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health." That doesn’t stop the Aussies from running an extensive system of public hospitals and a robust public health insurance program. Japan uses a different mix of tools to achieve the same results, and it too lacks a formal legal right to health care. There is a substantial body of Japanese health care law, but it has to do with creating various government programs and setting the rules of the game. A weak guarantee There are several international treaties and conventions that speak of the obligation of countries to provide for the health of their residents. The list includes the World Health Organization constitution and the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The United States signed and ratified the former, but it is literally one of a handful of countries that has not ratified the latter. For some, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a landmark document that comes very close to asserting health care as a right. The treaty’s language is ambitious. It speaks of "the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health." Countries that get behind it promise that they will aim to create the "conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness." But the convention’s legal heft is considerably less than its stated goals. It pushes no country to spend beyond its "available resources," a quantity that could be whatever the leaders say it is. Lawrence Gostin is the director of Georgetown University’s O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Gostin said the convention lacks teeth. "These international obligations are vague and unenforceable so really don’t translate into a ‘right’ in all states," Gostin said. For Gostin, the test of a nation’s commitment should be measured by the facts on the ground. "Does it provide even reasonably fair access to the entire population, and is there a way to enforce or implement the right?" Gostin said. "By those measures, the U.S. has many entitlements to health care, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and ACA subsidies. Yes there are many left out, but that is true in lots of countries, including China that provides a minuscule amount of health dollars to rural residents." Whether China is an industrialized country of the sort Sanders mentioned is a matter of debate, but China helps illustrate the difference between a right in law and a right in practice. China has ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. On top of that, its Constitution commits the state to provide health services and facilities "all for the protection of the people's health." But the record of the world’s most populous nation is checkered to say the least. David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a Boston-based health policy group, has written about the evolution of health care in China. In an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Blumenthal wrote that about 95 percent of the population has access to modest coverage. "The government has decided to provide all Chinese some protection against the cost of illness, not necessarily as a matter of right, but as a matter of fact," Blumenthal told PolitiFact. Ake Blomqvist, a health care economist at Carleton University in Canada, has a dimmer view of the connection between China’s legal promises and what it delivers. China might have signed that UN convention but that has had limited effect. "In reality the majority of people in China are at risk of not being able to receive even urgently needed health care if they are unlucky enough to require something that is expensive," Blomqvist said. A spokesman for Sanders, Warren Gunnels, told PolitiFact after the debate that Japan and Australia have created the right in practice even if it doesn't exist in law. He added that the Commonwealth Fund ranks the United States last in health care access among seven major nations. Our ruling Sanders said that the United States is the only major country that doesn’t guarantee health care to everyone as a right. Among the wealthy OECD nations, America -- with the possible exception of Mexico -- stands out as the only one that lacks universal coverage. The question of a guaranteed right to health care is murkier. Sanders spoke as though every advanced economy has it. In reality, some do and some don’t. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-12891	"In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/24/donald-trump/donald-trumps-numbers-homicide-increase-are-solid/	Now that Donald Trump moved into the White House, his staff has made over the White House website to its liking, including a new web page called "Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community." The page decries the country’s "dangerous anti-police atmosphere" and includes some new statistical claims about crime in the United States, including one about Washington, D.C., homicides that we rated Mostly False. Another claim on the web page addressing violence in major cities caught our eye. It read, "The Trump Administration is committed to reducing violent crime. In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years." Trump offered this same claim in July 2016, during his speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. As we noted in our original fact-check, Trump stuck close to the wording of a passage in a January 2016 article by the Wonkblog team at the Washington Post. "The number of homicides in the country's 50 largest cities rose nearly 17 percent last year, the greatest increase in lethal violence in a quarter century," the article began. Since the 2015 data used in the Wonkblog article was a projection based on preliminary figures, we decided to take a new crack at fact-checking the statement, this time using full-year FBI crime data for 2015 that had been released after the Wonkblog article appeared and after Trump made his speech at the convention. (Full-year data for 2016 is not yet available.) "In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities" First, we used Census Bureau data to determine the 50 largest cities. Then, we obtained the number of murders and non-negligent homicides for each of those cities in 2014 and 2015. We found that five of those cities -- Fort Worth, Texas; Raleigh, N.C.; Tucson, Ariz.; Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan. -- did not submit data for one of those years, so we excluded those cities from our calculations. That left 45 cities with data we could work with. When we added up the homicides in each of those 45 cities, we found that the total number increased by 16 percent between 2014 and 2015. That’s quite close to what Trump said. "That’s the largest increase in 25 years" To check whether the increase was the largest in a quarter-century, we recreated the Wonkblog methodology. They looked at the year-to-year rise or decline, in percentage points, of the homicide rate in the 50 largest U.S. cities. So we took the total number of homicides we’d assembled for those 45 cities and converted the raw numbers into the standard rate -- murders and non-negligent homicides per 100,000 population. In 2014, the homicide rate was 9.3 per 100,000 population. In 2015, the rate rose to 10.8 -- an increase of 1.5 percentage points. That was barely different from the 1.6 percentage-point increase that Wonkblog had found based on the preliminary data, and the chart makes clear that that was the biggest increase since 1990. So the White House website was correct that the jump in homicides between 2014 and 2015 was the largest increase in 25 years. This finding fits with our own research. The following graph we assembled from FBI data shows that in cities with a population of at least 250,000 -- shown in red -- the increase from 2014 to 2015 was the largest going back at least to 1995. (The top 50 cities all had populations of at least 388,000, so this is a somewhat broader group of cities.) Meanwhile, the overall national rate, in blue, also showed an uptick between 2014 and 2015. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, told PolitiFact that our methodology was sound. But he cautioned that the one-year uptick may not prove to be a lasting change in the trend line -- and that focusing on just one year’s numbers obscures the significant and consistent decline in homicides over the past-quarter century, as shown in the following chart: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "Violent crime rates are up compared with historic lows, and they are still very, very low compared with just five or 10 years ago," Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminologist, told PolitiFact last October. Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, agreed. "A small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20-year trend is downward," he said. "If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase." Our ruling The Trump White House website said, "In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years." By our calculations, the increase between 2014 and 2015 is very close to that -- 16 percent -- and this does appear to be the biggest one-year spike in 25 years. But we’ll reiterate a caveat we noted in past fact-checks: first, that even after the spike, homicide rates remain far lower now than they were 25 years ago, and second, that this one-year increase may, or may not, prove to be a significant turning point in the homicide trend line. We rate the statement Mostly True. Share the Facts Politifact 1 6 Politifact Rating: "In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities.

pomt-12006	The Graham-Cassidy health care bill does "include coverage of pre-existing conditions."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/21/donald-trump/trumps-misleading-claim-pre-existing-protections/	President Donald Trump said the latest Republican bill to get rid of Obamacare raises no concerns on coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. The question has become a sticking point in the repeal effort. Before the Affordable Care Act, insurers could deny coverage to people who had cancer, asthma or some other illness. The law banned that practice. "I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions," Trump tweeted. "It does! A great Bill. Repeal & Replace." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump is not entirely wrong, but his tweet papers over some pitfalls in what the bill offers. The key section lies in the bill’s rules for state waivers from many regulations in the Affordable Care Act (starting at page 8 in the bill.) If a state says it "intends to maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions," then it can allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones. Under the current rules, insurance companies can’t do that. They can’t factor in health, period. In addition, current Affordable Care Act rules limit the range for premiums and say companies can’t charge an older person more than three times what they charge a younger person. The waiver does away with those limits (starting at the bottom of page 12 in the bill). A state’s commitment boils down to maintaining "access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage." "That’s not nothing" in terms of protecting people with pre-existing conditions, said Indiana University health care law professor David Gamage. But beyond that, Gamage said the protection for pre-existing conditions gets murky. "The bill says states have to do something, but what that something is is unclear," Gamage said. "And it’s overwhelmingly likely that what some states do will won’t be as robust as what people have now." The health consulting firm Avalere found that 34 states plus the District of Columbia would see net funding cuts under the bill sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham. The Kaiser Family Foundation had a similar finding. One way or another, it costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it. On top of that, Gamage said, Affordable Care Act regulations spread some of the costs across the private sector. Those regulations would go away, too, meaning it would be up to the states to make up the difference. Cassidy spokesman Ty Bofferding disagreed. "We have guaranteed issue and expect states to use invisible risk-sharing (where states reimburse insurers for higher cost people) or other policies to cover pre-existing conditions or face misuse of funds penalties," Bofferding said. That might be a sincere hope, said law professor Wendy Netter Epstein at DePaul University, but the bill’s language doesn’t back it up. "The terms ‘adequate’ and ‘affordable’ are very much subject to interpretation," Epstein said. "What is adequate and affordable for one person may not be for another. And it almost certainly doesn’t mean that those with pre-existing conditions have to be charged the same as those without." If states fell short, Epstein said Washington regulators could try to hold their feet to the fire and press them to do better with their federal money, but "we can anticipate a whole lot of litigation." And even a win for Washington might not mean much in practice. "Folks who are sick and need health insurance coverage now don’t have the luxury of time to let these legal debates play out," Epstein said. Both Epstein and Gamage said in theory, states might find ways to squeeze much more health coverage out of each dollar. Or failing that, they might decide to put much more of their own money into health care and re-establish rules modeled on the Affordable Care Act. But they said neither outcome is likely. Epstein said there’s an underlying disagreement on what it means to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Under the Affordable Care Act, those people got the same kind of coverage at the same price as others. "But that’s not what President Trump and Sen. Cassidy mean when they say that the bill continues to require coverage for people with pre-existing conditions," Epstein said. "They mean that insurers will have to continue to cover people, but not at the same rates. And the policies don’t have to provide the same coverage." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said the Graham-Cassidy bill does include coverage of pre-existing conditions. The bill does address pre-existing conditions, and if states want billions of dollars in federal aid, they must show they intend to keep coverage accessible and affordable. But the other parts of the bill allow states to give insurance companies a free hand in charging those people higher premiums. Professors who study the U.S. health care system said the bill’s language protecting people with pre-existing conditions is vague and subject to broad interpretation. Plus, they said the bill’s reduction in funds going to two-thirds of the states will make it harder for them to protect people with past health problems. Under no circumstances do the protections in the bill equal the ones Americans have today under the Affordable Care Act. They are less. There’s an element of truth in Trump’s tweet but it obscures critical details. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05485	"Large phone companies and their trade association have hired 35 registered lobbyists to influence and pass SB 271 (deregulation legislation)."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/19/AARP/aarp-says-telephone-companies-hired-35-people-lobb/	While an abortion rights or gun control bill draws a crowd of regular citizens for a hearing, it’s the more staid changes to regulations for big businesses that can pack the house with dyed-in-the-Brooks-Brothers-suit lobbyists. It’s a certainty you won’t be able to swing a wingtip at the Statehouse without hitting a lobbyist when big industries with packs of full-time lobbying staffs on the payroll have a bill up in the legislature. Such is the case with Senate Bill 271, a bill that deregulates Ohio’s telecommunications industry. It already has passed the Senate and now is undergoing hearings in the Ohio House. Supported by the telecommunications industry, the bill is opposed by a coalition of consumer groups including AARP. In an AARP news release March 26 titled "Don’t Hang up On Ohio," the group laid out its case that access to basic telephone service for elderly and rural citizens may be curtailed by the bill. That’s because companies would be allowed to drop certain areas from coverage plans or force customers who want no-frills service to switch to services that cost more, the release stated. In the sixth paragraph, the advocates levied this claim: "Large phone companies and their trade association have hired 35 registered lobbyists to influence and pass SB 271." Is that true? PolitiFact Ohio started working the phones to find out. Our first call was to Kathy Keller, communications director for AARP Ohio, who said the news release was a collaborative effort among about a half-dozen organizations that banded together to fight the bill. She said the numbers on lobbyists came from Ellis Jacobs, an attorney who works with the Edgemont Neighborhood Coalition of Dayton, one of the organizations. Jacobs said he identified 35 lobbyists by going to the Ohio Legislative Activity Center, an on-line database kept by the Ohio Legislative Inspector General’s Office, and counting the registered lobbyists in telecommunications. He said he counted lobbyists from AT&T, Cincinnati Bell, Frontier Communications, the Ohio Telecom Association and Windstream to reach his number. However, Jacobs said he believes he may have inadvertently double counted a lobbyist or two when he did his initial check, and now believes there are 32 lobbyists. (Lobbyists are listed separately in the database depending on whether they are lobbying the executive, legislative or state retirement systems so there are some duplicative listings to wade through.) Not among those lobbyists being counted by Jacobs were four that lobby for CenturyLink, a communications company in 33 states including Ohio. "I wasn’t really familiar with CenturyLink so I didn’t include them," Jacobs said. Once they are included in the tally, the number of lobbyists working for large companies lobbying on this bill reaches 36 — about the number used by the coalition group led by AARP based on Jacobs' research. So while the number of phone company lobbyists is about right, what about the rest of AARP’s claim; that the lobbyists were hired "to influence and pass SB 271." That implies that the lobbyists were specifically hired to get SB 271 though the legislature. But a quick check of the same lobbying database shows that at the beginning of 2011 — long before SB 271 was on the scene — the same five companies plus the Ohio Telecom Association employed 33 lobbyists. It seems pretty clear that the 36 lobbyists represents the full roster of folks who are working to persuade the legislature on matters related to the telecommunications industry including SB 271. But they weren’t hired just to lobby on that bill. So where does that leave us as we call for the Truth-O-Meter? A coalition of consumers looking to stop legislation deregulating the phone industry in Ohio said "large phone companies and their trade association have hired 35 registered lobbyists to influence and pass" the legislation. Their count is in the right area code. They acknowledged they might have double counted a handful of lobbyists, but PolitiFact Ohio actually found some they missed and ended up tallying 36 who work for large telephone companies. These companies have staffs who lobby on their behalf all the time and these people weren’t hired just for this specific piece of legislation.

pomt-12279	"There is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/jun/30/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-wrong-conclude-senate-bill-wont-lead-m/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says reports that Floridians will be kicked off of Medicaid under the Senate health care bill are misleading. "As long as Florida keeps the same amount of funding or gets an increase, which is what we are working on, per patient being rewarded for having done the right thing -- there is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid. None," he said in a Facebook Live on June 28. "In fact, I asked the governor that point-blank, I asked the legislative leaders that point-blank. They have no plans, even if this bill passes, to kick anybody out of current services." Really -- no reason? We can’t know for certain what changes Florida will make to its Medicaid program down the road if the Senate bill becomes law. However, Rubio is making too strong of a vow here that there is no reason for anyone to lose Medicaid benefits. Here’s what we know: the Senate bill slows the rate of Medicaid dollars that the federal government gives to the states. This will force states to make tough choices, one potential being cutting enrollment. Some of the changes won’t happen for many years, delaying those choices for states. We contacted Rubio’s office but did not get a reply. (Rubio, who has long criticized Obamacare, hasn’t clearly stated if he will vote for the Senate health care bill. It was unclear as of June 30 when any potential new version would appear and when it would be brought up for a vote.) CBO and experts predict Medicaid enrollment declines Medicaid is the health care program for the poor funded by the federal government and the states. Under the Affordable Care Act, about 31 states agreed to financial incentives to expand eligibility for Medicaid. Florida rejected expansion. Currently about 4.4 million Floridians are on Medicaid or CHIP, a program for children. The Senate bill also provides additional money that might come to Florida. For states that didn't expand Medicaid, nationwide there would be up to $2 billion a year, and potentially other new funds aimed at hospitals with a high percentage of poor patients. But the Senate bill takes several steps to restrain future Medicaid spending. While the impact is greater on states that expanded Medicaid by making federal payments less generous, non-expansion states will also take a hit. The bill ends the open-ended promise for the federal government to cover a certain percentage of a state’s costs. Instead, the bill converts federal Medicaid funding to a per-person cap and limits growth in federal spending beginning in 2020. In 2025, it shifts to a different consumer price index, which has a lower inflation factor than is used today. That will without a doubt be a lower rate than underlying cost growth, and the gap will grow each year, said Matthew Buettgens, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. Medicaid spending goes up whether the current Affordable Care Act remains in place or if the House or Senate versions become law. However, the Republican health care bills slow the rate of spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that total Medicaid spending from the Senate bill would be about $770 billion less than under current law over the next decade, leading to an enrollment decline of 15 million. The Urban Institute estimated the decline in federal dollars and enrollment for the states. It found for Florida, that federal funding for Medicaid under ACA would be $16.8 billion in 2022. Under the Senate legislation, it would fall to about $14.6 billion, or a cut of about 13 percent (see table 6). The Urban Institute projects 353,000 fewer people on Medicaid or CHIP in Florida. The gap in funding is largely driven by enrollment numbers. Under the ACA, the federal government takes steps to actively recruit people to sign up for Medicaid, even in states that didn’t expand the program. The Republican Senate bill doesn’t have that same goal to spread the word about Medicaid eligibility. In fact, it aims to curtail sign ups. Here are a few ways it sets out to do that: Mandatory six-month eligibility checks that could reduce enrollment Takes away the right of hospitals to make presumptive-eligibility determinations Limits the effective date for retroactive coverage of Medicaid benefits to the month in which the applicant applied (currently it is a three-month window) There is no doubt that the Senate bill leads to cuts that will affect Florida, said experts on Medicaid spending, including Buettgens; Joan Alker, an expert at Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy; and Elizabeth Carpenter, senior vice president at Avalere Health, a consulting group. Alker said the cap will result in all states making substantial cuts to their Medicaid program. Those would likely be even bigger in the second years after the CBO window. The cuts will force states to fill the gap in some way that could include any combination of these options: cutting enrollment or benefits, reducing provider payments, cutting other areas of the budget or raising taxes. "While it is impossible to say exactly what states will do, they will only have bad choices — especially those like Florida that are starting with low per capita spending very much below the national average," Alker said. Florida would likely reduce monthly payments to health plans leading providers to reduce the number of Medicaid patients they serve or stop serving them all together, said Jeffrey Harman, a professor in the Department of Behavioral Sciences & Social Medicine at Florida State University. "Recent cuts in Medicaid payments to specialists in Texas has left many Texans that rely on Medicaid without access to specialty care, which can have life and death consequences," Harman said. "I believe similar effects would be seen in Florida." Rubio said that Scott and legislative leaders told him they won’t cut services, but those decisions will lie with a future governor and legislators years from now. Other experts pointed us to the Urban Institute’s analysis but we’ll note that a separate group, the liberal Center for American Progress, cited an even higher number by using a different methodology that factored in potential expansion. Rubio challenged the center’s prediction that 1 million Floridians will lose Medicaid by 2026. Our ruling Rubio said, "There is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid." Rubio is wrong to state that benefit cuts are off the table. There are reasons that Medicaid recipients could lose benefits if the Senate bill becomes law. The bill curbs the rate of spending by the federal government over the next decade and caps dollar amounts and ultimately reduces the inflation factor. Those changes will put pressure on states to make difficult choices including the possibility of cutting services. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-04090	In 2010, 2,694 young people were killed by gunfire. 1,773 were victims of homicide; 67 were elementary school-age children.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/18/college-presidents/college-presidents-weigh-gun-deaths-young-people/	Five days after shootings in Newtown, Conn., left 28 people dead -- including 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary -- leaders at two of Georgia’s higher education institutions weighed in on the gun safety debate. Leaders of Oglethorpe University and Agnes Scott College -- both are in DeKalb County -- released an open letter pushing for stricter gun safety legislation. It was initially co-signed by more than 160 other college and university presidents nationwide, including Atlanta’s Morehouse and Spelman colleges and Clark Atlanta University. Oglethorpe President Lawrence M. Schall said he was moved to draft the letter after watching a televised memorial service for Newtown victims. "For many years now, our nation’s leaders have engaged in fevered debates on higher education, yet lawmakers shy away from taking action on one issue that prevents thousands of young people from living lives of promise, let alone realizing their college dreams. That issue is gun safety," the letter reads. " … In 2010, 2,694 young people were killed by gunfire. 1,773 were victims of homicide; 67 were elementary school-age children. If those children and teens were alive today, they would fill 108 classrooms of 25 each." Since the Connecticut shooting, the gun safety debate has come front and center at all levels of government. The White House has rolled out a $500 million gun safety package. State lawmakers are pushing for armed officers in schools. Metro Atlanta school districts have conducted "active shooter" lockdown drills for staff and students. A multitude of statistics has been tossed about by advocates on both sides of the issue to make their points. We wondered if the data used by higher education leaders was accurate. And we were curious how it was compiled. By the time President Barack Obama unveiled his gun-violence reduction plan this week, the list of higher education co-signers of the gun safety letter had risen to more than 300. The letter has received national attention, with coverage on news outlets including CNN, The Huffington Post, NPR and The Wall Street Journal. A spokesman for Oglethorpe University said the gun death statistics used in the letter were taken directly from data also used by the Children’s Defense Fund, the Washington, D.C., child-advocacy organization led by Marian Wright Edelman. The data includes figures for children and youths through age 19. In one of her weekly "Child Watch" columns last month, Edelman used the same statistics to also implore action on gun violence. The figures cited by the Children’s Defense Fund are actually data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and available in its WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) online database research system. For its various data, the CDC WONDER system uses information collected from its agency affiliates. The mortality data used in the gun safety letter is compiled from death certificates issued in each state and recorded by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. That information is then included in the WONDER database. Of note are the types of gun deaths included in the numbers cited. The list of 2,694 young people reportedly killed by gunfire includes those who died of suicide, as well as accidental discharge of a firearm and discharge of a firearm with an undetermined intent. The CDC’s homicide figure varies slightly from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports for 2010. The FBI crime statistics are produced from data provided by 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States. For children and youths through age 19, 1,402 were victims of homicide (it does not include suicide) by gunfire in 2010, according to the FBI crime report. That is similar to the CDC’s figure of 1,773 homicide victims of the same age during the same year. The FBI and CDC data sets are the two main sources of these types of statistics, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University in Boston. The CDC numbers can be slightly higher because the FBI figures do not include data from every police department in the country (about 92 percent of the departments submit information to the FBI). But the FBI data, which is published annually, is more up to date, Fox said. The lag time for reporting CDC data is about a year longer. So, are the numbers of child gun deaths cited in the letter from the college and university presidents accurate? It depends on who collects, compiles and publishes the data, as well as what is included in the numbers. In the case of the CDC data, it is virtually impossible to track down each death certificate from 2010 to verify the cause of death. Based on an examination of the WONDER data, the numbers appear accurate. It is important to note that the figure for the number of children and youths killed by guns three years ago includes causes such as suicides and unintentional discharges.

pomt-01490	Says President Barack Obama attacked potential terrorist targets in Syria in the middle of the night "to minimize terrorist casualties."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/25/ralph-peters/fox-analyst-airstrikes-syria-conducted-night-minim/	U.S. fighter pilots and drones launched their assault on terrorist-linked spots in Syria early Sept. 23, 2014, under the cover of darkness. Retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, who appears frequently on Fox News as the network’s "strategic analyst," said that was done by design. But not for the reason you might think. "You think the time of day for these strikes is significant. Why?" Fox News’ Bill Hemmer asked Peters on America’s Newsroom on Sept. 24. "Well, it really, really mattered," Peters said. "And I think the media were so enraptured with dramatic footage of the cruise missile launches and the before and after photos that they missed the fundamental point: that Obama had restrictions on this air operation to minimize not just civilian (casualties), but to minimize terrorist casualties. "He didn't want bloodshed, so we attacked in the middle of the night. Now the only reason you’d attack in the middle of the night is if there is a forbidding air defense complex and you’re worried about it -- there were no air defenses in the areas we attacked. The Syrians certainly weren't going to turn on anything they had. ISIS doesn't have them. You could have gone in there safely in a hang glider. But instead we went in the middle of the night. Why? Because the buildings were empty." Did America really target terrorist strongholds at night only as a way to avoid killing terrorists? We found that there are plenty of other possible explanations for a night-time attack. Peters, in an interview with PunditFact, stood by his comments. "In the past we attacked at night to reduce the capability of the enemy's air-defense systems to target our aircraft," he said. "In this case, there was no air-defense threat in the areas held by Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL)." A spokesman for U.S. Central Command was reluctant to discuss operations in Syria, pointing out the goal of taking out the terrorists’ infrastructure -- access to oil refineries, financial centers, radio dishes, transportation corridors, training sites, etc. -- that has made Syria a "safe haven" for terrorism, as Obama has said. The strikes against Islamic State and Khorasan were along the northern Turkish border and IS’ Raqqa headquarters. CentCom released videos of attacks near al Tabqah, a refinery, and ISIS vehicle storage location. Night attacks are standard procedure, and Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom all started in a similar manner, said retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula, the principal attack planner for the Operation Desert Storm air campaign and commander of the combined air operation center for Operation Enduring Freedom. "The bottom line is, if you go back and look historically, we generally do strike first at night because there is a surprise factor, and folks aren’t expecting it," said Deptula, also dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, a Washington-based research group founded by the Air Force Association. Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-director of the institution’s Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, agreed with Deptula’s point, saying a night attack would cloak the otherwise visual giveaway and prevent terrorists from using cell phones to spread word of a looming aerial threat. "I think that's a more credible theory than Ralph's in this case," O’Hanlon said. While there is little doubt that the Defense Department is trying to minimize civilian casualties, "I disagree on the point about desiring to minimize terrorist casualties," said retired Air Force Col. Mark Gunzinger, who works at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "I actually find that a rather strange comment." Another reason for a night attack, experts told us, is American aircraft enjoy their biggest advantage when they fly at night, as U.S. pilots are trained to wear night vision goggles and perform low-visibility military assignments. Peters, for the most part, did describe the air defense capabilities of Syria and the Islamic State correctly, experts said. Given Syria’s mutual problem with the Islamic State, it’s unlikely the Syrian Integrated Air Defense System would threaten U.S. warplanes en route to ISIS targets, said Christopher Harmer, an Institute for the Study of War senior naval analyst with the Middle East Security Project. ISIS’ air defense is basic and includes some large caliber anti-aircraft cannons, he said. "These rudimentary air defense systems are completely ineffective at night," Harmer said. "Although they are not much of a threat, flying at night minimizes that risk as well." Our ruling Peters said that the United States launched airstrikes against terrorist targets at night "to minimize terrorist casualties." He said the only reason for a night-time attack would be to hit empty buildings. One of the principles of PunditFact is that people who make factual claims are accountable for their words and should be able to provide evidence to back them up. In this case, Peters’ evidence appears to be speculation based on his knowledge of past airstrikes. However, several experts detailed other reasons why the United States would strike at night. The ultimate motives are unknown, but lack of information casts a big shadow over Peters’ claim. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-02352	"Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times. Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- just once."	true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/20/jim-moore/sen-ted-cruz-has-been-iowa-four-times-his-tenure-r/	Texan James Moore, a self-described progressive pundit and communications consultant, took note of a Texas U.S. senator's latest stop in Iowa by posting a comparative tweet on March 20, 2014. "Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times. Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- just once," Moore wrote. Cruz, a Republican lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, has been flitting in and out of Iowa, home to the quadrennial party caucuses kicking off each presidential election year. We were curious whether Moore's contrast holds up, especially per the infrequency of Cruz's forays to the valley, the region closest to the state’s southeastern border with Mexico. 'Anybody will tell you' Moore, who was in McAllen when we talked to him, told us by phone that his claim -- meant to refer to Cruz’s time as a senator, he said -- was based on what Moore had heard while in the valley. "Everybody and anybody in the valley will tell you," Moore said, adding that Cruz had spoken at a club and then at a border park. After emailing Cruz's office about the accuracy of Moore’s statement, we searched the Nexis database of news stories for accounts on Cruz trips to the valley and Iowa. Let’s start with the Texas mention, then count Cruz trips to Iowa. Several valley stops on Sept. 3, 2013 In Cruz’s nearly 15 months as senator, he spent a weekday in the valley, according to regional news stories. That day was Sept. 3, 2013, when Cruz spoke at a sold-out luncheon in Mission and a stop at the Anzalduas International Bridge in Mission, according to news stories posted that day by the McAllen Monitor and San Antonio Express-News. Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Cruz did three events that day in the valley--going to McAllen for a Department of Public Safety border tour and roundtable with landowners to discuss border/immigration policy and to Mission for a "Rio Grande Partnership" lunch. Cruz, Frazier said, looks forward to more events in the valley, "one specific region in the state." "Since being sworn in," she said, "he has traveled to 38 Texas cities for 118 events." Cruz also stumped in the valley before his election. According to a Monitor news story posted online Oct. 13, 2012, Cruz was featured at a weekend event hosted at a Mission club by the McAllen Tea Party Association. Nearly 250 people paid $25 each to attend, according to the article. Cruz said then: "We are campaigning all across the state of Texas. From the day we started this campaign nearly two years ago, we’ve gone 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, crisscrossing the state." Moore told us the fact that his tweet didn’t say he was speaking to Cruz’s time as senator wasn’t significant, partly because Twitter posts are limited to 140 characters. A Moore commentary published by the Huffington Post a few hours after he wrote his tweet was direct about focusing on Cruz's Senate time. Cruz, Moore wrote, "has been to Iowa four times in the... months he has been in office but has made one appearance here in the subtropical region along the border." Four Iowa trips Now let's look north, where news stories indicate Cruz has been to the Hawkeye State four times since joining the Senate. On Feb. 11, 2014, a Dallas Morning News news blog post datelined Washington, D.C., opened by saying Cruz "returns to Iowa next month -- his fourth trip in eight months, ensuring ongoing speculation about his 2016 ambitions." The newspaper made the same fourth-time-in-eight-months reference in its March 18, 2014, news story on Cruz’s appearance before the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators. And before? Cruz made his initial senatorial trip to Iowa in July 2013, according to a July 19, 2013, Associated Press news story, giving a private speech to the conservative American Renewal Project and headlining a GOP fundraiser. A commentary by Wayne Slater of the Morning News, posted online that day, said that when reporters in Iowa inquired into Cruz’s presidential ambitions, he demurred. "I've been in office all of seven months," Cruz said. "Prior to that, the last elective office I held was student council. It's been quite a whirlwind." The senator’s second Iowa stop occurred Aug. 10, 2013 when he spoke to hundreds of evangelical Christians and social conservatives at a summit in Ames, Iowa, according to a news story posted online that day by the Ames Tribune. Another Iowa stop, Politico reported, entailed Cruz stirring Iowa Republicans at an annual fundraising dinner Oct. 25, 2013 before heading to a pheasant hunt in the state. In an Oct. 26, 2013, news story, the Omaha World-Herald summed up: "This was Cruz's third visit to Iowa this year..." The 'fair comparison' On Cruz's behalf, Frazier said by email the "fair comparison to make is that the senator has been to Iowa 4 times and travels back to Texas almost every weekend." Our ruling Moore tweeted: "Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times. Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- just once." This is correct if limited to Cruz’s year-plus as the state’s junior senator, which is what Moore made clear in his subsequent blog post. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-14931	In 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama "missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes." In 2004, John Kerry missed "close to 60 to 70 percent" and Bob Graham missed "over 30 percent of his votes."	true	/florida/statements/2015/oct/28/marco-rubio/when-attacked-missed-votes-marco-rubio-calls-out-b/	A major Florida newspaper’s editorial board called for U.S. Sen Marco Rubio to resign because of his record of missed votes in the Senate. The next day, Rubio was asked about it at the CNBC Republican debate in Boulder, Colo. CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla asked Rubio about the editorial and if he hated his job. Rubio countered that the Sun Sentinel had showed "bias" in its endorsements, because a few other senators who ran for president had missed a huge chunk of votes, too. "Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I don't recall them calling for his resignation. … Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. In fact, the Sun Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement." What was the voting record of Sens. Obama, Kerry and Graham when they ran for president? We decided to check the roll call, as well as the endorsement record. Playing hooky In 2008, Obama missed 137 out of 213 votes, or 64.3 percent of votes. (His career absentee rate is 24.2 percent.) In 2004, Kerry missed 89.8 percent of votes. (His career rate is 7.7 percent.) That's somewhat higher than what Rubio said. From January to October 2003, which includes the span of his campaign, Graham was absent 37 percent of the time. (His career rate is 3.2 percent.) Graham also underwent heart surgery on Jan. 31 that year, which caused him to miss votes before his official campaign launch. For his part, Rubio has missed 99 out of 291 votes (about 34 percent) from the start of the year to Oct. 22, more than any other candidate in the race, according to Govtrack.us. Rubio recently took the "most truant career" sash from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Here’s how Rubio stacks up against the other senator-candidates right now: Senator 2015 votes missed (Jan. 1 to Oct. 28) 2015 absentee rate Career absentee rate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 99 34.0 percent 12.3 percent (176 out of 1,434) Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) 79 27.1 percent 5.8 percent 237 out of 4,107) Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 70 24.1 percent 12.0 percent (114 out of 948) Rand Paul (R-Ky.) 14 4.8 percent 3.7 percent (53 out of 1,434) Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 10 3.4 percent 3.0 percent (84 out of 2,787) Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y., 2001-2009) NA NA 9.5 percent (249 out of 2,616) Rick Santorum (R-Penn., 1995-2006 ) NA NA 1.9 percent (79 out of 4,156) The newspaper endorsements The Sun Sentinel is based in Broward County, the county with the highest number of registered Democratic voters in Florida, according to state records through September. The Sun Sentinel endorsed Obama in 2008 but endorsed Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. "When President came into office in 2009, the economy was in freefall and though untested, he inspired us with his promise of hope and change," the Sun Sentinel wrote in October 2012. "Now, four years later, we have little reason to believe he can turn things around." Graham ran for the Democratic nomination in the 2004 race but was only a candidate for a few months. He filed his papers to form a president campaign committee Feb. 27, 2003, launched his campaign May 6 and dropped out Oct. 6, 2003. We couldn’t find the Sun Sentinel criticizing his voting record. In October 2004, the Sun Sentinel endorsed Kerry: "The Massachusetts senator possesses a prodigious intellect capable of grasping the complexities of the serious issues facing the nation and the world," the Sentinel wrote. The Sentinel’s editorial page editor Rosemary O’Hara, who joined board in 2012, told PolitiFact that as far as Rubio’s endorsement "We believed him when he said he wanted to work for Floridians in the Senate." While Clinton and Obama were criticized when they ran for president for missing votes, "I don't recall either of them complaining about the job," O’Hara told PolitiFact. "By contrast, Sen. Rubio has made it clear he doesn't like the job, which is why he wants another. Also, Sen. Obama and Clinton were not the senators from Florida. Marco Rubio is our guy. We have a personal relationship with him. We have only two people representing us in the U.S. Senate, and he said he wanted to do the job." Our ruling Rubio said that Obama "missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes," that Kerry missed "close to 60 to 70 percent" and that Graham missed "over 30 percent of his votes" when they were running for president. Those numbers check out, though Obama’s and Kerry’s numbers were over the course of an election year. Rubio is also correct that the newspaper didn’t call for their resignations. Overall, we rate Rubio’s statement True. Correction: This report has been updated to correct minor math errors in the calculations of voting percentages. Rubio's numbers remain on track, and our rating remains the same.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-10-28T22:27:58	2015-10-28	['Bob_Graham', 'John_Kerry', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-09491	"I vetoed more than $3 billion in spending. Lawmakers and I cut taxes for 40,000 small businesses. Now Texas is No. 1 in job creation. The nation’s five best housing markets are right here in Texas. We balanced five state budgets and we cut state spending."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/24/rick-perry/gov-perry-says-he-made-tough-decisions-including-3/	UPDATE, Aug. 10, 2010: The article below corrects an error in the original on the percentage increase in non-dedicated state spending on Perry's watch. The increase amounts to 45 percent. This correction doesn't affect our rating of Perry's overall statement. Republican Gov. Rick Perry, seeking his party’s nod for a third full term, says he’s made tough decisions making Texas the best state for business. In a TV ad that debuted Feb. 8, Perry lists seven reasons voters should support him in the March 2 primary: "I vetoed more than $3 billion in spending. Lawmakers and I cut taxes for 40,000 small businesses. Now Texas is No. 1 in job creation. The nation’s five best housing markets are right here in Texas. We balanced five state budgets and we cut state spending. Today we have billions in surplus." Phew. Is all of that so? We previously gauged Perry’s reference to the state having billions in surplus, a statement we rated as Barely True here. As for Perry’s veto claim, his campaign told us it was based on adding up all spending that Perry vetoed after each of five regular legislative sessions. That sounds straightforward. But it’s been debunked by the Dallas Morning News, which found that much of the vetoed spending never would have happened regardless. That’s because separate legislation authorizing the expenditures failed to pass into law. The newspaper said that nearly $2.5 billion of the more than $3 billion touted by Perry already was doomed because the required authorizing measures failed to pass. The News said the funds at issue reflected "agencies that were discontinued, federal money that had to be repaid anyway and spending that was shortly thereafter restored, with Perry’s general approval." The newspaper's analysis continued: "The governor has even acknowledged that the vetoes were merely procedural. In supporting materials for the ad, his campaign points to the veto proclamations Perry issued at the time, and in those, he explains that the underlying bills failed to pass the Legislature." Perry’s reference to cutting taxes for small businesses harkens to a proposal he signed last year raising the annual income threshold for businesses subject to the state’s retooled business franchise tax from $300,000 to $1 million. Thanks to the action, more than 130,000 businesses were exempted from the tax, including almost 40,000 that had to pay the tax in 2008 and 2009, according to the state comptroller’s office. Perry's ad doesn't mention that on his watch, more than 940,000 businesses were subject to the revamped tax as of 2008, up from more than 692,000 businesses subject to the old version in 2007, according to the state comptroller's office. Perry traces his statement that Texas is now No. 1 in job creation to a press release issued recently by Tom Pauken, who chairs the Texas Workforce Commission. Pauken compares the number of private-sector jobs in each of the most populous states in December 2009 to the number of jobs in December 1999. Texas saw a private-sector jobs increase of 9.3 percent over the period with Florida proving the only other big state with net job gains. That's impressive history, though it doesn't confirm Texas is currently No. 1 in job creation, as Perry says in the ad. The commission provided a national breakdown showing that between December 2008 and December 2009, only the District of Columbia enjoyed net job gains. Texas saw a 2.6 percent drop in employment over the year, faring better than 33 states though worse than 16. More recently, Texas has fared better. In the last quarter of 2009, Texas enjoyed a net jobs gain of 49,100 to 10,355,000 jobs. Among the 10 most populous states, only Michigan enjoyed any gains, of 9,700 jobs. All in all, Texas's net job gains exceeded the total of 47,200 job gains combined reported by nine other states and the District of Columbia, the only other places in the United States that recorded net job gains in the quarter. Perry ties his celebration of the Texas housing market to a February 2009 article in Builder 2009, a publication of Hanley Wood Market Intelligence, which rated Houston, Austin, Fort Worth, San Antonio and Dallas as the nation's best housing markets based on population and job growth changes, which its article calls "perennial drivers of housing demand." The publication states it also looked at what’s happened with home prices and new building permits. All the indicators were combined to score each community; the 15 cities with the best scores were featured. An October update of the rankings shows each of the Texas cities still among the country's top 10 markets. As Perry says, Texas has balanced five state budgets on his watch. But he doesn't let on that it has to. It's constitutionally impermissible for the budget not to be balanced. The governor makes a shakier claim when he says: "And we cut state spending." That's not true if one compares how much state spending was budgeted before he became governor to the current budget. Spending of non-dedicated state general revenue has gone up about $25 billion since the 2000-01 budget -- an increase of 45 percent in Perry's time as governor. Perry’s campaign notes correctly that twice in Perry's time as governor, lawmakers budgeted less spending from general revenue funds than had been spent in the previous two-year budget. The 2009 Legislature approved a budget that spent nearly $80.7 billion in non-dedicated state funds in 2010-11, down nearly 2 percent from the 2008-09 budget, thanks in part to federal stimulus aid. And in 2004-5, non-dedicated state spending dropped 1.6 percent as lawmakers adjusted to a projected $10 billion revenue shortfall. All told, Perry talks a good game in his ad. Much of what he says has some truth to it. Texas is a jobs Mecca. Several of the state's housing markets were national standouts last year. And Perry is correct too that about 40,000 businesses were exempted from paying the franchise tax though he fails to note that more businesses are subject to the revamped tax than before. Not so good: Perry misrepresents the significance of balancing the state budget, a must-do for every legislature and governor. He distorts the size and substance of his budget vetoes. As previously reported, his claim that Texas has a surplus in the billions is Barely True since the state is expected to confront a revenue shortfall in 2012-13. Finally, Perry's claim to cutting state spending could lead viewers to think spending has decreased on his watch, which isn't so. Perry’s ad drifts from evidence-strong facts to full-bore misrepresentations. We rate his statement altogether as Half True.

pomt-07656	Says four-year terms for City Council members are "the norm in most cities of our size."	true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/13/lee-leffingwell/austin-mayor-lee-leffingwell-says-four-year-city-c/	Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell, advocating changes in the city’s governing charter, says it doesn’t make sense for City Council members to have three-year terms. In his Feb. 25 State of the City address, Leffingwell said that four-year terms are "the norm in most cities of our size." News to us. Leffingwell, who hopes to seek voter approval of term changes in 2012, later told us the change would result in one council election every four years, sparing voters from facing two council elections every three years as they do now. Also, he said, "if you ask politicians who are serving two-year terms, they find themselves in constant campaign mode. Campaigns are very exhausting and very costly." To back up the mayor’s claim, his office provided a spreadsheet listing 34 cities plus Austin and the length of each city’s council terms. Spokesman Matt Curtis said consultant Mark Littlefield looked at the nation’s 30 most populous cities drawing on city websites and U.S. Census 2007 population estimates. According to the sheet, 29 of the cities have four-year council terms, five cities have two-year terms--and only Austin has three-year terms. Four-year terms prevail in some of the country’s largest cities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia; they’re also in place in San Diego, Denver, Oklahoma City and, in Texas, El Paso. Four Texas cities--Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth--join Charlotte, N.C. in having two-year council terms, the mayor’s research says. Wondering if the other listed cities are comparable to Austin, we compared their 2009 estimated populations as gauged by the U.S. Census Bureau. Austin’s estimated population that year was 786,386; the average population for the other cities was 30 percent greater, 1,019,849. The 10 cities with populations closest to Austin’s size ranged from Boston, at 645,169, to Detroit, at 910,921. Among them, Boston, Charlotte and Fort Worth have two-year terms, and the other seven cities have four-year terms, according to our checks of city websites and interviews of respective city officials. Twist: Leffingwell’s fact sheet shows Boston’s council members with four-year terms, but Ann Braga, the Boston council’s staff director, told us that’s true only for the mayor. So, 70 percent of cities close in population to Austin are represented by council members elected to four-year terms. We rate the statement True.

pomt-00349	Says Barack Obama "referred to the carnage that took place in Benghazi as a conspiracy theory."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/14/blog-posting/conspiracy-website-objects-barack-obama-calling-ou/	Shocker! A conspiracy-minded website is appalled that former President Barack Obama dismissed a conspiracy theory. The day after Obama spoke in Anaheim, Calif., to gin up support for Democrats in the midterm elections, the website American Viral Patriot posted an article headlined "Obama Disrespects Heroes Of Benghazi, Calls It ‘Wild Conspiracy Theory,’ Survivor Cleans His Clock." The Sept. 9 item said that in that speech, Obama "referred to the carnage that took place in Benghazi as a conspiracy theory." No, he didn’t. (And by the way, Obama gave the speech in question a day earlier, in Illinois. He made no mention of Benghazi or conspiracies in Anaheim.) Obama was decrying what he saw had happened to the Republican Party, how, as he put it, the GOP had become home to "the politics of division, of resentment and paranoia." Obama gave his list of measures a Republican Congress had championed. "Handed out tax cuts without regard to deficits," he said. "Slashed the safety net wherever it could. Cast dozens of votes to take away health insurance from ordinary Americans. Embraced wild conspiracy theories, like those surrounding Benghazi, or my birth certificate." Note, he spoke of conspiracy theories surrounding Benghazi, not that the deaths that took place were themselves a conspiracy theory. After eight congressional investigations and a report by a review board, the broad finding was that the State Department failed to adequately address security concerns in Libya or could have done more to prevent the attack. But if they found bad bureaucratic decisions, none found bad intent. That didn’t give American Viral Patriot any pause. After misquoting Obama it went on to say, "There’s solid reason to believe that Hillary was aware of an impending attack but never pulled her team out of there or made efforts to further secure the embassy and/or compound." The website then, without evidence, claimed that "Obama has consistently hid behind the fact that compromised Republicans never dared impeach him for his criminal use of the IRS, the EPA, the CFPB, the CIA, the FBI, the DOJ, and the Department of State." Bold words, and like, the claim, untethered to facts. Obama did not call Benghazi a conspiracy theory. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03008	Says U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz "voted to cut off Florida’s veterans and their benefits."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/16/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-says-wasserman-schultz-voted-cut-veterans-bene/	The House of Representatives might not have been able to hold a speedy vote to end the shutdown but that doesn’t mean it didn’t hold lots of votes. And where there are votes, there are opportunities to use those votes against your opponents. Veterans benefits are always fertile ground for this tactic and this week, the Republican National Committee launched a robocall campaign aimed at a handful of Democrats, nominally for their failure to support veterans. On the target list are Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D- Nev., Sens. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Mary Landrieu, D-La., and Kay Hagan, D-N.C., and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. Wasserman Schultz is also chair of the Democratic National Committee. Here’s part of the GOP script slated for Wasserman Schultz’s district: "Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz thinks this shutdown is a game. She voted to cut off Florida’s veterans and their benefits while the government is shutdown. In a bipartisan vote the House of Representatives wanted to make sure our veterans got the benefits they earned fighting for our freedoms. These men and women served our country with honor but Debbie Wasserman Schultz would rather put partisan politics ahead of honoring our commitment to the people who defended this country." The claim we’ll check is whether the congresswoman "voted to cut off Florida’s veterans and their benefits" during the shutdown. When we asked the Republican National Committee which vote they had in mind, they pointed to H.J. Res 72, one of the mini-funding resolutions favored by House Republicans to reopen slices of the government. The bill was aimed at preventing the worst results of the shutdown rather than ending it entirely. About 95 percent of Veterans Affairs workers are exempt from the worker furloughs that have happened because of the stalemate in Washington. Accordingly, most benefits and health care services have continued. But new claims for disability benefits have been stuck at the rear of an already large backlog of claims. Plus, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki warned Congress that if the shutdown extended into November, his department would not have enough money to send out more than 5 million checks worth about $6 billion. The House measure would have provided funding to avoid that. The bill won the support of every Republican and 35 Democrats and easily passed the House, but the Democratic-controlled Senate would have nothing to do with it. As a party, Democrats took the approach that the best thing to do would be to end the shutdown across the board. With the Senate in Democratic hands, every House mini-funding bill was doomed. Wasserman Schultz was one of 157 House Democrats who voted against the bill. So did the vote actually "cut off veterans and their benefits"? The phrasing in the robocall glosses over why benefits might be at risk. Regardless of which party was more responsible for the shutdown, and people of different political beliefs will disagree over that, Republicans have some responsibility for creating a situation where veterans benefits might be interrupted. It was House Republicans who pressed to defund President Barack Obama’s signature health care law that ended up leading to the shutdown. Wasserman Schultz might have failed to back this particular approach to ensure benefits would continue under a worst-case scenario, but they were flowing at the time of the vote, and she did not vote to cut them off. The context is considerably more complex. Veterans groups divided While the Republicans present her vote as contrary to veterans' interests, the groups that lobby on veterans behalf offered a different view. Several large groups, including Disabled American Veterans, AMVETS, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars, decided not to endorse the Republican bill. "We didn’t take a position on this resolution," said Raymond Kelley, director of National Legislative Service for Veterans of Foreign Wars. "Our response when asked was that Congress cannot effectively provide all of the benefits and services through a piecemeal approach and that we wanted Congress to pass a fully funded VA budget." Veterans groups noted that the full House had passed an appropriations bill for Veterans Affairs in June. (Wasserman Schultz voted for it; the vote was 421-4.) That provided about $6.2 billion more than the stopgap measure. Veterans groups urged lawmakers of both parties in both houses of Congress to move forward with that. One organization, the American Legion, did get behind the temporary House bill. "We are here to support veterans, not get in the middle of a political fray," explained Louis Celli, legislative affairs director for the American Legion. "Of course, the whole government being open supports vets in a more holistic way, but we will never pass up an opportunity to help vets." For example, housing and job training assistance programs exclusively for veterans are run by other departments that were untouched by the House bill. Celli said his organization does not hold a "no" vote against any lawmaker. He said he understands many are strong supporters of veterans, and they wanted a bigger plan to fund all programs at once. "We won’t come out and condemn any lawmaker who voted a different way," Celli said. Many Democratic efforts to fund the entire government, including Veterans Affairs, were unsuccessful in the House. Wasserman Schultz’s office said she voted 17 times on measures that would have ended the shutdown. Our ruling The Republican National Committee said in a robocall that Wasserman Schultz voted to cut off benefits for veterans. The claim is suspect on several fronts. It focuses on one bill out of many that would have preserved ongoing funds for veterans programs. Wasserman Schultz could accurately claim she voted many more times to support such funding. Some of the largest veterans organizations did not endorse the Republican measure, given the overall context of a government shutdown. And the wording in the robocall makes a muddle of the entire sequence of events, beginning with why veterans benefits might be at risk, and the reality that in the short run, most benefits have been flowing. We rate the claim False.	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2013-10-16T11:25:37	2013-10-14	['United_States', 'Debbie_Wasserman_Schultz']
pomt-10507	Obama says America is great, but let's "try to change it."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/24/blog-posting/a-made-up-quote-goes-global/	They have online names like fiberguy, dittoheadAZ and Hank the Tank. And they're among scores who have made blog postings and sent e-mails passing on a quote they attribute to Sen. Barack Obama: "My friends, we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world. I hope you'll join with me as we try to change it." The quote is almost always accompanied by a barb that asks why the candidate would want to change something that is so great. It appears, however, that Obama never made the remark. It originated in a Jan. 28, 2008, blog post on The Corner, a blog at National Review Online. The poster was Mark Steyn, the Canadian columnist, author and conservative commentator, who was passing along a made-up, tongue-in-cheek stump speech crafted by a "correspondent of mine." Steyn, whose work appears in many newspapers and is a frequent guest on conservative radio and TV, has his own Web site. Said Victoria Ayrsmith, an assistant editor at SteynOnline.com: "The alleged quote is, in fact, a letter from one of Mark's readers, who devised a parodic all-purpose stump speech written in the aftermath of Iowa and New Hampshire when Senators McCain and Clinton were claiming to be 'agents of change.' There is no mention of Barack Obama anywhere in the item at all." If fact, it was attributed to no one, not even its intended targets, McCain and Clinton. Ayrsmith continued: "The letter was submitted to the Mailbox page at our Web site, but Mark thought it a funny enough joke to merit a stand-alone post at National Review. It is the inspired creation of one of his readers north of the border — John Gross, who lives in the Province of Quebec. Mr. Gross certainly deserves credit, if only because, with all the attention it's getting, it seems likely to be in the next edition of Bartlett's." Some of the confusion may have come from the headline Steyn placed on his original post, "Barracking Barack." We contacted Obama's campaign. But on a week when his staff was consumed with fallout from Obama's ties to Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., they seemed unconcerned about the inquiry. A staffer who asked not to be named said, "I don't think he said this but I'm not 100 percent sure." We conducted a thorough electronic search of all print stories as well as transcripts of television and radio programs, news conferences and press briefings. There is no record that Obama or any other candidate publicly uttered the words in question. More evidence: A Google search of the quote finds no mention of it before Steyn's Jan. 28 post. Our fact-checking cousins at Snopes.com also looked into the quote and the claims that Obama said it. They found them false. We'll second that. In fact, it's so false it's Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-11822	"Hispanic entrepreneurs, those who have immigrated from Spanish-speaking countries, often start three times as many businesses as white males."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/nov/14/chris-king/do-hispanic-entrepreneurs-often-start-three-times-/	Chris King, a self-proclaimed "progressive entrepreneur," tied Florida’s economic well-being to the prosperity of immigrants at a recent forum with fellow Democratic candidates for governor. King offered an eye-popping statistic comparing Hispanic immigrants to working white men to prove his point. "Well, Hispanic entrepreneurs, those who have immigrated from Spanish-speaking countries, often start three times as many businesses as white males," King said at a forum hosted by the Florida Democratic Party on Oct. 28. "So, we have a need that they fulfill, and this is a governor who is going to communicate that constantly." We wondered about his statistic. A spokesperson for King’s campaign clarified that he was referring to the rate of growth in the number of businesses started by these demographics, not the raw number of total businesses started. After some digging, we found a lot of data that speaks to the fact that Hispanics entrepreneurs are opening businesses at a faster rate than the non-Hispanic white population nationwide. Hispanic ownership of businesses is growing fast King campaign manager Zach Learner sent PolitiFact Florida a few pieces of evidence to support this claim, but most of the data is almost a decade old or does not speak to King’s exact wording. Remember: He was comparing the growth of businesses started by Hispanic entrepreneurs, which includes men and women, to white men. We asked the King campaign to clarify whether the candidate was referring to Hispanic immigrants, that is Hispanics who were not born citizens of the United States, or Hispanic entrepreneurs, which could include immigrants and nonimmigrants. We did not hear back. But we found that the talking point holds up with either reading. First, we turned to the Census Bureau’s 2015 American Survey of Entrepreneurs, the most up-to-data from the Bureau. This survey, which started in 2014, attempts to produce yearly estimates on businesses and business ownership by various demographic groups, and is meant to supplement the Survey of Business Owners, which is only conducted every five years. The Bureau defines Hispanic-owned businesses as those operating in the United States as 51 percent or more of their ownership to be by individuals of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or other Hispanic or Latino origin. Based on the most recent information from the bureau, the number of Hispanic-owned businesses with paid employees (owned by men and women) increased by 4.6 percent from 2014 to 2015, or by about 299,000 to 313,000 businesses. In contrast, the number of businesses owned by white men grew by about 1 percent between the same time, from 2.91 million to 2.94 million. So, based on this data, Hispanic-owned businesses grew at a rate about three times faster than white men. But there are some problems with this comparison. First off, comparing the growth of businesses started by Hispanic entrepreneurs, which includes men and women, to white men, is not an apples-to-apples comparison. More important to know is that the Census Bureau hasn’t tabulated a male, non-Hispanic white category. In other words, there’s no way to separate white men and Hispanics who identify as white. "Since Hispanic is defined as an ethnicity and white as a race, there can be double counting within the Hispanic category as the category includes ‘Hispanic white’," said Virginia Hyer, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Census Bureau. So the rate could actually be higher than what King said. Hyer recommended comparing the "non-Hispanic white" category to the Hispanic category. Based on data from those categories, the number of non-Hispanic white-owned businesses grew less than 1 percent, from about 4.1 million to 4.2 million. And the number of Hispanic-owned businesses with paid employees increased by 4.7 percent. That means the Hispanic growth rate for businesses from 2014 to 2015 was more than three times the growth rate for non-Hispanic white businesses opened by men and women. We also looked at older data that covers a larger timeframe from the Census Bureau that support that overall notion that that Hispanic immigrants are opening businesses at a faster rate than white men. According to the 2012 Survey for Business Owners, the number of Hispanic entrepreneurs not born a citizen of the United States increased 28 percent between 2007 to 2012, from 645,000 entrepreneurs to 827,000. In the same time, the number of white entrepreneurs who are men only increased 6.5 percent, from 11.7 million to 12.5 million. (Unlike the American Survey for Entrepreneurs, the data is not tabulated by non-Hispanic whites, so the total count of white men could include Hispanics who identify as white.) The growth of Hispanic-owned businesses mirrors the country’s rising Hispanic population. Hispanics are the second-fastest growing racial or ethnic group, according to the Pew Research Center. Between 2000 and 2016, the Hispanic population grew from 35.7 million to 56.5 million, a jump of more than 50 percent. In a previous fact-check on a similar claim, Javier Palomarez, CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the Hispanic population is aware of and responds well to Hispanic-led businesses, which might explain some of the growth. Our ruling King said, "Hispanic entrepreneurs, those who have immigrated from Spanish speaking countries, often start three times as many businesses as white males." King’s campaign was referring to the rate of growth in the number of businesses started by these demographics. Whether looking at just Hispanic immigrants or Hispanic entrepreneurs, King has a point. The overall trend — that Hispanic-owned businesses are popping up faster than white non-Hispanic demographics — is correct. The growth rate from 2014 to 2015 for Hispanic-owned businesses was more than three times as much as the growth rate for non-Hispanic whites. Comparing the number the number of all Hispanic entrepreneurs to white men entrepreneurs is somewhat imperfect, as the tally of businesses owned by white men could be inflated by the businesses started by Hispanics who identify as white.

pomt-05610	"The state [food stamp call center] program is administered from foreign shores."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/28/nan-orrock/stats-hurt-georgia-lawmakers-claim/	OK, who enjoys calling customer service? Occasionally, the voice on the other end of the phone, if you’re able to talk to a live person, is halfway around the world, and the conversation is often difficult to understand because of accents and poor telephone reception. That usually happens when you’re calling about your laptop that’s not working properly, but how about calls to Georgia’s food stamp call center program? "Did you know that JPMorgan Chase right now has a contract to administer the food stamps program, and if you call the number you are instructed to on the website you will be speaking to someone for whom English is a second language and they live in another country," said state Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat. "And if you ask them where they live, they will say it’s a security issue and I cannot reveal that." Orrock was talking about Senate Bill 492, which is aimed at improving the state’s purchasing process on construction projects. She wanted an amendment to the bill that would require the call center program be administered in the U.S.A. "We contract with a private corporation, and they promptly ship the jobs overseas to administer the program, the state program, in this case for food stamps, the state program is administered from foreign shores," Orrock said. So, is this state program administered from foreign shores? Georgia’s food stamp program, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is managed by the state’s Department of Human Resources. The website has links to information in 11 languages. DHR spokeswoman Ravae Graham told PolitiFact Georgia that only 3 percent of the calls are handled overseas. Graham also sent us the most recent monthly call data. In February, 1.3 percent of the approximately 2.85 million calls were handled in India and Mexico. All the others were handled in this country. The senator initially questioned the numbers in a telephone interview and asked for a few days to provide us information. A few days later, she sent us a report done in November by Channel 2 Action News that investigated the use of food stamp call centers outside the U.S. The report noted that 3 percent of those calls were handled overseas. Orrock was interviewed in that report. She talked about her concerns that some of these calls were handled outside the U.S. "rather than creating those jobs here, because we will be employing people who will then put their paycheck back into our economy." Orrock told us in a statement that she could have spoken more precisely. She said "administered" was a poor choice of words. "I am aware that the entire program is not delivered by people working overseas, and throughout my speech made reference to the call centers being delivered overseas," Orrock said in a statement. "In speaking without prepared text perhaps I made a poor choice of words in saying administer, but my meaning was clear and I repeated several times that I was referring to the offshoring of call center jobs for the food stamp program, and not the administration of the entire food stamp program. "Some of those call center services are delivered here, and my amendment was not aimed at those services," Orrock continued. "The sole purpose of my amendment was to address the jobs offshored with Georgia taxpayer dollars." Orrock’s amendment narrowly passed the Senate, but it was removed from the legislation when it came to the House of Representatives. As for our call on her claim, only a small percentage of those food stamp calls are handled outside the U.S. Her statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical factors, such as the 97 percent of calls handled here, that would give a different impression of someone unfamiliar with the program. Under our rating system, Orrock gets a Mostly False.	None	Nan Orrock	None	None	None	2012-03-28T06:00:00	2012-03-07	['None']
pomt-07140	The Medicare drug program "resulted in the program coming in 40 percent under budget. ... And the reason it was, is because the design was right."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/15/rick-santorum/did-medicare-part-d-come-40-percent-under-budget-b/	For some fiscal conservatives, the Medicare prescription drug benefit remains a symbol of when Republicans lost their way. So it wasn't surprising that it came up when Republican candidates for president debated on May 5, 2011, in South Carolina. Rick Santorum was a U.S. senator when the plan was passed in 2003. Then, he voted in favor of the plan, a vote he has since called a mistake. Santorum got this question at the debate: "You voted for it. It's cost hundreds of billions of dollars. You've said you regretted that vote now. As president, would you work to repeal that and leave the 25 million-plus seniors, who now enjoy that benefit, without it?" "No," Santorum said. "What I would do is work to reform the entire Medicare system, which is what's being proposed by Paul Ryan and what I've been proposing for a very long time. One of the reasons I actually voted for the Medicare prescription drug plan was because it was a private sector operated plan. It was not, as the current Medicare system is, and what Obamacare is, a government-run, top-down type of approach. And in fact, the way we designed that program resulted in the program coming in 40 percent under budget. ... And the reason it was, is because the design was right." The Medicare prescription drug plan, also known as Medicare Part D, helps pay for prescription drugs for people eligible for Medicare. Private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that's best for them. Most beneficiaries get to choose from an average of 33 different plans. The average monthly premium is about $40, but costs and coverage varies with each plan. In addition to premiums, beneficiaries typically pay a deductible, and they pay a portion of the prescription costs. Beneficiaries can change plans every year if they wish. Even by fact-checking standards, Medicare Part D is a pretty complex plan, and we're leaving out an excruciating level of detail here. Fortunately, there's a government website where they can type in their prescriptions and dosages, and the website spits out information to help with the decision. We decided to check Santorum's numbers on whether the plan came in under budget. We also wanted to understand why it came in under budget. Was it really because of the plan's design? First, the numbers. Did it come in 40 percent under budget? We asked Santorum's campaign for their source but didn't hear back. There are two official estimates for Medicare Part D costs, one put out by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and another put out by the board of trustees for the Medicare trust funds. These reports calculated potential costs differently, so there are different sets of numbers to work with. The board of trustees projected costs higher than the Congressional Budget Office, so if you use the trustees' numbers, the savings are greater and come closer to 40 percent. If you use the Congressional Budget Office numbers, the savings are somewhat lower. In addition, two analysts we spoke with said you have to subtract the premiums that patients pay, as well as contributions from the states. If you account for those sources of revenue, the program comes in about 28 percent below budget, said Edwin Park, an analyst with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He walked us through his analysis, and it seemed like a reasonable, though different, way to calculate costs. Whether it's 40 percent or 28 percent, though, we found wide consensus that the program is coming in under budget. Next, why is it under budget? Santorum says it was because of the program's design, because it was a private-sector operated plan. One reason it came in under budget is fairly straightforward: Not as many people signed up for the benefit as the government expected. The government projected that about 93 percent of people who use Medicare would also sign up for the prescription drug benefit. But actual enrollment is only at about 77 percent of those eligible, a significant difference. It's not clear why fewer people signed up -- whether they didn't know about the program, didn't need it or for some other reason. But it's hard to say for sure, and we couldn't find any studies on the matter. The other reason costs came in under budget is that drug spending did not increase in the 2000s as fast as it increased in the 1990s. So initial cost projections likely overestimated how fast drug spending would grow during the first 10 years of the program. Part of the reason for that is that there were more generic drugs coming onto the market and fewer new blockbuster drugs during the 2000s, said Dr. Jack Hoadley, a health policy analyst at Georgetown University. Still, said Dr. Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush, it would be wrong to discount the impact of the program's design, particularly the role it played in encouraging the use of generic drugs. Under the plan, beneficiaries take an active role in shopping for a plan and comparing costs. By selecting a less expensive plan, they save themselves and the government money, she said. "I don't want to say it's 100 percent, but I think it's just foolish to say that wasn't an important contribution," she said. Insurance companies, meanwhile, have access to aggregated data on what kinds of drugs are most popular and at what dosages, said Richard Kaplan, an expert on retiree health care at the University of Illinois. The companies rework their plans every year in hopes of persuading more seniors to leave their competitors and join their plans. Beneficiaries can look every year to get a better deal, and the insurance companies can make sure they’re not losing too much money, he added. Kaplan also said the dreaded doughnut hole may play a part in bringing down the costs of Medicare Part D. The doughnut hole is a coverage gap during which participants pay 100 percent of drug costs. If their costs continue beyond the doughnut hole, the government provides more subsidies. Beneficiaries have an incentive to keep their drug purchases below the doughnut hole level (and yes, we know that sounds bizarre). "The curiosity may be that the bizarre doughnut hole forced people to really pay attention to cost and substitute generic drugs so that they could avoid the doughnut hole," Kaplan said. President Barack Obama's health care law seeks to phase out the doughnut hole, but it will still be important for another five to six years, he said. Getting back to our ruling statement, Santorum said that the Medicare drug program "resulted in the program coming in 40 percent under budget. ... And the reason it was, is because the design was right." We found that Santorum is right that the program came in under budget, but he picked the high end of the estimate for how much the savings were. We also found that there is a good bit of disagreement on why the program came in under budget. Some credit the design, but design is just one of several factors that may have kept the program under budget, and there's not much clarity on how much weight each factor should get. Overall, we rate Santorum's statement Half True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2011-06-15T16:01:26	2011-05-05	['None']
pomt-09334	"Florida Statutes require (Attorney General Bill) McCollum to consult with members of Florida's Congressional delegation" before filing a lawsuit against the health care reform law.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/12/alex-sink/sink-mccollum-delegation-health-care-lawsuit/	Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate for governor, issued a news release on March 25, 2010, that accused her Republican rival, state attorney general Bill McCollum, of breaking the law when he filed a lawsuit against the health care reform bill recently signed by President Barack Obama. In the release, the Sink campaign wrote that McCollum "was so eager to file a partisan lawsuit designed to deny Floridians the benefits of the new health care reform bill (that) he may have neglected his duty under Florida law. Florida Statutes require McCollum to consult with members of Florida's Congressional delegation before filing his politically motivated lawsuit against health care reform." Specifically, the Sink release continued, "Florida Statutes state that if an Attorney General is undertaking action opposing federal legislation, they must 'furnish to each of the several representatives in the Congress from this state, a written statement giving the reasons for any action being considered, or about to be taken ... and if possible, shall procure the assistance of such representatives.' However, multiple members of Florida's Congressional Delegation received no such statement from Bill McCollum." We were intrigued by the claim that a state law might require such a consultation, so we decided to look into it. First, some background on the lawsuit. McCollum is one of 18 state attorneys general -- all but one are Republicans -- challenging the new health care law. In a March 22 news conference, McCollum argued that the "individual mandate" -- the requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance or face a tax penalty -- is an infringement on individual liberty. "This is a tax or a penalty on just living. And that's unconstitutional," McCollum said. "There is no provision in the Constitution of the United States giving Congress the power to do that. So it's the absence of authority that is unconstitutional." Democrats attacked the lawsuit as politically motivated, a charge McCollum has dismissed. The question of whether the attorney general went through proper legal channels before pursuing the lawsuit emerged when U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from South Florida, responded "state law requires a study and to consult with the congressional delegation." Sink's campaign picked up the issue from there, citing Florida statute section 16.52, "Participation in preserving constitutional integrity of state." You can read the full text on the Legislature's Web site, but it essentially says that in order to allow the state to take part in legal efforts with other states about federal laws, that Florida's Department of Legal Affairs needs to first study the impact of the new federal law to see if it includes "objectionable or harmful encroachments upon the constitutional integrity of state governments. . . . " The law specifies that the Department of Legal Affairs give a report to members of Florida's congressional delegation that explains the reasons that legal action is being considered and says that "if possible," the department "shall procure the assistance of such representatives therein and therefor." Sink is right that the law is on the books, even if it's a bit dusty. The statute dates from 1943, as is made clear by its mention of "due regard to this state's full contribution to the national war effort." And the statute hasn't always been adhered to, said Peter Antonacci, a Democrat who served as Florida's deputy attorney general. Antonacci, now in private practice with the firm Gray Robinson, noted that in a case filed during the 1990s, when Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles was in office, state and local Florida officials sued the federal government, alleging it had failed to enforce immigration policies, leaving the state with heavy expenses in educating and providing public services to undocumented immigrants. Like McCollum's lawsuit, the immigration case dealt with the impact of federal government actions on the state. Yet, Antonacci told PolitiFact Florida that, "we didn’t seek anyone's opinion from either party" before filing the suit. "We didn't regard the statute as anything that was even guiding, much less binding on the attorney general. This is a statute that might as well have been written in the Civil War for all its relevance today." McCollum's office agrees with Antonacci's interpretation, citing common-law powers -- those created by previous court decisions -- that empower the attorney general to challenge the constitutionality of a statute. McCollum's office points to a 1999 memo from the opinions division to then-Attorney General Bob Butterworth -- a Democrat -- that says just that. "The courts of this state have recognized that that Attorney General possesses broad common law powers in addition to those prescribed by statute," the memo to Butterworth says. "Among these powers is the authority to prosecute all actions necessary for the protection and the defense of the property and revenue of the state. ... This authority includes the initiation of lawsuits in both state and federal court to protect the public interest. ... The authority of the Attorney General to challenge the constitutionality of a statute has also been recognized as a common law power." Finally, McCollum's office noted that he did provide an analysis that could fulfill the law's requirement. On Jan. 19, 2010, the attorney general's office released a five-page document signed by McCollum personally that was titled, "Constitutional Analysis of the Individual Mandate in the Federal Health Care Legislation." In the cover letter, McCollum wrote, "I call your attention to these legal concerns so that constitutional issues may be remedied before a final bill is negotiated. I will continue to work with my Attorney General colleagues in order to pursue appropriate legal action should these provisions be in a bill that becomes law." The letter was addressed to the four Congressional leaders -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. It was posted on the attorney general's Web site, along with a news release. In our judgment, this document seems to fit the requirements of the Florida statute -- namely, "a study of federal legislation -- existing and proposed -- to determine whether such legislation has resulted, or may result, in objectionable or harmful encroachments upon the constitutional integrity of state governments." The trickier question is whether the document adheres to the statute's requirement that the attorney general "shall furnish to each of the several representatives in the Congress from this state, a written statement giving the reasons for any action being considered, or about to be taken hereunder at the time." Sandi Copes, communications director for the Florida attorney general's office, said that "we sent the memo to Rep. Pelosi, Sen. Reid, Rep. Boehner and Sen. McConnell, as well as Sen. George LeMieux. We also sent it out to our full distribution list, including over 1,000 press contacts, and posted it on our public Web site." Antonacci said what McCollum's office did went "beyond the call of duty based on my experience" as deputy attorney general. Not good enough, said Wasserman Schultz spokesman Jonathan Beeton. "I don't think (the letter) meets a minimum (requirement), even for a zoning board meeting, which requires more notice than that. I'm pretty sure that when they wrote the statute the intent was that they'd interact with the members of Congress, not simply hope they visited a Web site." When PolitiFact raised this question, the Sink campaign had Jennifer S. Blohm, an attorney with the Tallahassee law firm Meyer, Brooks, Demma and Blohm, write a legal analysis. In the memo, Blohm argued that "the statute's language is unambiguous. Providing a memorandum to Congressional leadership from outside the state of Florida and posting the memorandum on the Attorney General's Web site does not comply with the plain language of the statute. ... The statute does not place the onus on Florida's Congressional delegation to seek out what actions the Attorney General may be contemplating. It is the Attorney General's duty to inform Florida's Congressional delegation of his or her proposed actions with regards to federal legislation and seek the delegation's input and, hopefully, assistance in any planned actions." (In an earlier legal memo, Blohm also argued that state law trumps common law. So to recap: Sink is correct that the law is still on the books. But it's been ignored and a former deputy attorney general says he doesn't find it binding. It's important to note here that we are not rendering a legal verdict on McCollum's actions but merely saying whether Sink is correct that "Florida Statutes require McCollum to consult with members of Florida's Congressional delegation" before filing the suit. They do, although there's definitely debate about how much the law still applies. So we'll take this one down a notch to Mostly True.

pomt-11653	"A ‘gerrymander’ is by definition and common understanding, a strange looking ‘monster’ drawing. This map is clearly not that."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/jan/10/robin-hayes/nc-gop-gerrymander-strange-looking-monster-drawing/	A panel of judges on Tuesday struck down North Carolina’s election districts for U.S. Congress, and the state’s Republican leaders aren’t happy. The panel was unanimous in ruling that North Carolina lawmakers under Republican leadership violated the U.S. Constitution’s equal-protection clause when they drew maps explicitly to favor their party. It was the first time federal judges have struck down congressional districts as partisan gerrymanders. North Carolina has been at the center of election map battles since 2011, when some sued the state for what they called unfair congressional and legislative maps. The decision drew swift rebukes from Republican lawmakers and organizational leaders. Some said they’ll appeal and some questioned a judge’s impartiality. Robin Hayes, chairman of the N.C. GOP, issued a statement suggesting that the judges’ understanding of gerrymandering is warped. Hayes focused on geographic shapes, noting that the ill-fated maps kept 87 of North Carolina's 100 counties whole and divided only 12 precincts. "A ‘gerrymander’ is by definition and common understanding, a strange looking ‘monster’ drawing. This map is clearly not that," Hayes said in a Jan. 10 statement. "Judge Wynn is not being a judge, he is acting as a pundit by trying to impose his liberal beliefs instead of making a judicial ruling." The origin of the term The term "gerrymandering" comes from the 1800s, when a critic of newly-drawn election maps compared one of the districts to a salamander. And Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the N.C. GOP, referenced the term’s origins when he emailed PolitiFact to explain Hayes’ claim. "It is important to note that this definition accompanied an ‘eye’ test," Woodhouse said. "In other words the meaning of the word came WITH a illustration that showed a bizarre looking districts, something many people would object to just based on how they look." Hayes and Woodhouse share the view of state Senate leader Phil Berger, who falsely claimed last year that North Carolina has the "strictest anti-gerrymandering standards in the country." Berger’s argument, like the N.C. GOP’s, was based on the idea that compact districts that keep counties intact are therefore fair. While initial claims of gerrymandering focused on district shapes, and experts say district shapes can be an indicator of gerrymandering, they aren’t the lone test of whether something is gerrymandered. "The history of using gerrymandering to partisan advantage goes all the way back to the original use of the term for tilting state senate districts in Massachusetts," said Moon Duchin, associate professor of mathematics and Senior Fellow at Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University. "These days, with incredibly rich data available to the line-drawers, very skewed districts no longer have to look like exotic reptiles with fangs and claws," Duchin said in an email. "The current map in North Carolina is a great example – it is an extreme outlier, more favorable to Republicans than 99.5% of maps produced by a neutral process." Types of gerrymandering There are three main types of gerrymandering, as explained by Vox: There’s partisan gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts to favor one party. (On Tuesday, judges ruled that North Carolina’s congressional maps are unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders meant to favor Republicans.) There’s racial gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts that dilute the influence of a particular race or community. There’s even bipartisan gerrymandering, when mapmakers draw districts that protect incumbents in both parties. "The North Carolina court adopted the same definition of partisan gerrymandering as the Supreme Court: a district plan that aims to benefit a particular party and in fact does so severely, durably, and unjustifiably," said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor from the University of Chicago. "That North Carolina's districts are not as ugly as in previous years is neither here nor there. You can obviously have nicer-looking districts that still intentionally and dramatically favor one side over the other," Stephanopoulos said. Check out this explanation by the Washington Post, which includes a helpful graphic, for a visual representation of Stephanopoulos’ argument. Stephanopoulos and Eric McGhee, a public policy fellow at University of California-Berkeley, created a new measure known as the "efficiency gap" -- the difference between the two parties' wasted votes, divided by the total votes cast -- which is a focal point in the partisan gerrymandering case from Wisconsin that was argued at the U.S. Supreme Court in October. (Wasted votes are when voters are shifted into districts where their votes won’t matter, either because their party’s candidate can’t win or is already sure to win.) McGhee said the courts haven’t cemented district shapes as a requirement of gerrymandering. "I’m not a lawyer, so I can’t give a legal opinion," McGhee said in an email. "But the question of whether a gerrymander requires funny-shaped ("non-compact") districts is not a matter of settled law or definition." He said defenders of the Wisconsin assembly and NC congressional maps have argued that non-compactness is required. "But the lower courts have not been sympathetic so far. [It] remains to be seen what SCOTUS will say," McGhee said, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court. Duchin noted that there are three high-profile cases where courts plan to explore methods for measuring partisan gerrymandering. "None of them emphasizes district shapes," he said. As for the shapes of NC’s congressional districts and whether they resemble monsters, some Washington Post reporters say they see not only ghastly images – but also at least one squirrel, dog and Sherlock Holmes, among other things. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Hayes said a gerrymander is "by definition and common understanding, a strange looking ‘monster’ drawing," insinuating that North Carolina’s Republican-drawn maps can’t be gerrymanders if the districts have smooth edges and look nice. While he’s right that weird shapes can be indicators of gerrymanders, shapes are not the lone determining factor. And there’s more than just one definition of gerrymandering.

pomt-09733	If President Obama signs the Copenhagen climate change treaty, he "will sign your freedom, your democracy, and your prosperity away forever — and neither you nor any subsequent government you may elect would have any power whatsoever to take it back again."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/20/christopher-monckton/british-climate-skeptic-says-copenhagen-treaty-thr/	Christopher Monckton — a British hereditary peer and high-profile skeptic of both global warming and international agreements — caused a stir on Oct. 14, 2009, with a forceful denunciation of the upcoming international talks on climate change in Copenhagen, Denmark, scheduled for Dec. 7-18, 2009. In a speech in St. Paul, Minn., Monckton called the pending agreement a "dreadful treaty" and said, among other things, that the parties "are about to impose a communist world government on the world. You have a president who has very strong sympathies with that point of view. He's going to sign. He'll sign anything." Monckton continued, "So, thank you, America. You were the beacon of freedom to the world. It is a privilege merely to stand on this soil of freedom while it is still free. But in the next few weeks, unless you stop it, your president will sign your freedom, your democracy, and your prosperity away forever — and neither you nor any subsequent government you may elect would have any power whatsoever to take it back again. That is how serious it is." For this item, we'll put aside the debate on whether it is wise to institute policies, such as emissions cuts, to curb climate change — the "prosperity" portion of Monckton's comment. Instead, we'll stick to analyzing Monckton's claim that an agreement coming out of the Copenhagen talks would, one, sign away American sovereignty and, two, be irreversible. Let's start with some background. The Copenhagen meeting, which President Barack Obama is expected to attend, is part of an ongoing process sponsored by a United Nations body called the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Its goal is to secure international cooperation to curb the emission of gases that scientists blame for raising global temperatures, a development that could harm the environment. The first — and crucially important — point to make is that there is no "treaty" yet. The most recent iteration is a 180-page document, posted publicly in September, called the "reordering and consolidation of text in the revised negotiating text." If you think that title sounds clunky, just check out the document itself: Rendered in impenetrable diplo-speak, the document offers an almost stream-of-consciousness array of alternate options, blanks to be filled in and bracketed phrases. Supporters and critics alike agree that the final text, if one emerges, will be radically shorter and clearer. In other words, it's impossible to draw conclusions about what international leaders will be asked to sign based on the current draft. A second point worth noting is that, due to wide differences of opinion among the 192 participating nations, the Copenhagen conference looks increasingly unlikely to produce anything ready to sign. “There isn’t sufficient time to get the whole thing done,” Yvo De Boer, the Dutch diplomat who oversees the negotiations, said in mid October, according to the New York Times . “But I hope it will go well beyond simply a declaration of principles. The form I would like it to take is the groundwork for a ratifiable agreement next year.” What we learn from these two points is that the substance of the agreement remains distinctly up in the air, and that Obama is unlikely to be asked to sign anything at the conference beyond a nonbinding statement of interim steps or a promise to meet again — if that. Now we'll look at Monckton's argument that the Copenhagen talks could eventually produce something that eats away at American sovereignty. Experts in international law acknowledge that, with the final draft unresolved, anything is possible. But they added that numerous safeguards would help prevent U.S. sovereignty from being yielded. — Signing a treaty doesn't mean that its provisions become binding . Instead, it simply means that you intend to become a party to the treaty by seeking domestic approval, using whatever procedures are in effect in your country. In the United States, that means taking the treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent on ratification. For instance, the United States signed the Kyoto Protocol on climate change — the predecessor to the agreement being negotiated in Copenhagen — but never ratified it due to opposition in the Senate. As a result, the United States was never subject to any of the protocol's rules. — The Senate would have to approve any binding agreement with a 67-vote supermajority . This means that a treaty only becomes binding after a supermajority of democratically elected senators, plus the president, consent. So if the United States decides to give up some of its sovereignty in the matter of carbon emissions, it will only do so after a significant amount of political consent is given. As a practical matter, the high Senate threshold for ratifying a treaty, set by the Constitution, effectively requires broad support from lawmakers in both parties, something the Kyoto Protocol did not have. (Even after ratification, the treaty may not become binding until a certain number of nations have ratified it, depending how the treaty language is written; this could further delay or even derail the process.) — The Obama administration has publicly pledged that it will not sign an agreement unacceptable to Congress . According to the New York Times , the chief American climate negotiator, Todd Stern, and his deputy, Jonathan Pershing, have both affirmed this position. “We are not going to be part of an agreement we cannot meet,” Pershing said at a recent negotiators’ meeting in Bangkok. — The negotiators are aware of sovereignty concerns and are weighing options that would limit intrusiveness . Nigel Purvis, a former State Department negotiator under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said that the Copenhagen negotiations "are premised on the idea that each nation would create its own low- carbon economic growth strategy," adding that the degree of international enforcement is very much in play. Most experts, he said, "agree that punitive noncompliance measures are highly unlikely. Thus, the approach is really quite decentralized and respectful of national sovereignty — the opposite of being subject to a command-and-control U.N. agency." — Even if the United States does eventually cede some sovereignty on climate change, "freedom" and "democracy" are not at stake . John H. Knox, a law professor at Wake Forest University, calls Monckton's notion "silly." "Any treaty limits the freedom of the parties, of course, just as any contract limits the freedom of its parties," Knox said. "But none of the proposals on the table, and none that could conceivably be suggested, would deny the United States freedom to keep a democratic system of government, and no such agreement could imaginably be signed or ratified by the United States. And no treaty can override the provisions of the U.S. Constitution in any event." Now, for Monckton's second claim, that "neither you nor any subsequent government you may elect would have any power whatsoever to take it back again." Our experts say it's nonsense. Either a country can exit a treaty using a procedure described in the treaty itself — usually involving formal notice, a delay and the forefeit of rights to have a further say in implementing or shaping the treaty in question — or it can simply walk away. Doing either would likely entail consequences for the departing country, but they would most likely be "soft" penalties such as loss of international esteem. "There's nothing in any of the documents for Copenhagen that talk about any greater penalties than those," said Jake Schmidt, the international climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Of course, other countries could react to a withdrawal by pursuing bilateral or multilateral action, such as a trade embargo or a cutoff of diplomatic contacts. But they could take such actions today, even without a climate change agreement. "Even if a new climate treaty were ratified and the United States thus became a party to it, the United States could later choose to withdraw from it," Knox said. "Withdrawing from a treaty is perfectly acceptable under international law unless the treaty itself precludes it. Even in that case, the United States could always choose not to comply with the treaty, just as a person can choose to violate a domestic law, with the important difference that the international community does not have a police force standing by to arrest wrongdoing nations. The United States would not suddenly lose its discretion to decide whether to comply with the treaty, in other words." Steven Groves, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, acknowledges that Monckton's claims are "perhaps overstated a bit." But he argues that being vigilant on the sovereignty consequences of a Copenhagen agreement is still important. Groves suggests that it's possible to devise an agreement that protects national sovereignty, perhaps by eliminating an international enforcement mechanism and relying instead on self-regulation by member countries. But doing so would mean instituting an agreement without much teeth, because it would require trusting countries with little transparency and a lot of self-interest to evade the rules. On the other hand, implementing a more forceful international oversight regime would likely run into more problems on the sovereignty front. "For a treaty to be effective in ratcheting down emissions, you would need some sort of enforcement mechanism with real teeth, and that raises legitimate sovereignty concerns," said Ben Lieberman, another Heritage fellow. Even so, we find Monckton's claims to not only be unsupported but preposterous. First, it's impossible to know what agreement will come out of Copenhagen, and when. Second, the U.S. procedure for ratifying treaties requires consent by a supermajority of the Senate — a steep hurdle. Third, it's hard to envision anything coming out of Copenhagen that would change the United States' bedrock principles of freedom and democracy. And fourth, contrary to what Monckton says, the United States can leave an international agreement. So while it pays to be vigilant about threats to U.S. sovereignty, this one is not the threat that Monckton's rhetoric suggests. So Lord Monckton earns a special ruling — Britches on Fire!

pomt-01564	In Tripoli, "jihadists today swim in our embassy pool."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/11/rand-paul/does-video-show-islamic-jihadists-jumping-us-embas/	In a recent op-ed for Time, Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul pushed back against hawks in Washington who write off his foreign-policy strategy as "isolationist" at a time of mounting international crises. "Some pundits are surprised that I support destroying the Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) militarily. They shouldn’t be," Paul wrote. "I’ve said since I began public life that I am not an isolationist, nor am I an interventionist. I look at the world, and consider war, realistically and constitutionally." Paul goes on to describe the state of world affairs during President Barack Obama’s term, including in Libya after the fall of ruler Muammar Gaddafi. "Libya is a sanctuary and safe haven for training and arms for terrorists from Northern Africa to Syria," Paul said. "Our deserted Embassy in Tripoli is controlled by militants. Jihadists today swim in our embassy pool." Paul doubled down on that assertion Sept. 10 after Obama announced his strategy for dealing with the terrorist organization Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. We wondered: Are there really jihadists swimming in our embassy pool in Tripoli? So we decided to take a look. Are militants occupying and damaging the embassy? Since Gaddafi was ousted three years ago by rebel groups aided by French and American airstrikes, Libya has been in chaos, with a weak central government and warring secular and Islamic factions fighting for control of the state. Renewed violence in the Libyan capital Tripoli forced the United States and several allies, including France and Spain, to pull their embassy staffs out of the city in July, leaving behind unoccupied diplomatic posts. Paul’s statement refers to an amateur video posted on YouTube that surfaced in mid August. In it, a large group of Libyans are circled around a pool, while men jump from a second story balcony into the water. According to the New York Times, one man is heard saying, "This used to be the American embassy. God is great!" Since the video’s release — and prior to the publication of Paul’s op-ed — many more details have been reported about what exactly happened. For starters, the man in the video wrongly identified the compound as the "American embassy." On Twitter, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Deborah Jones wrote that the video "appears to be a residential annex of the U.S. mission but cannot say definitively since not there." The Associated Press and New York Times verified as much on Aug. 31. Jones added in another Twitter post: "To my knowledge and per recent photos the U.S. Embassy Tripoli chancery and compound is now being safeguarded and has not been ransacked." The U.S. embassy in Tripoli is about a half mile to a mile from the spot filmed. Are the men jihadists? More questionable is Paul’s assertion that those occupying the residential compound were "jihadists." Since the fall of Gaddafi, local militia groups, including some responsible for leading the revolution, have maintained law enforcement and government functions throughout the country. However, more recently, fighting between the various militias has escalated. In July, one militia group, the Dawn of Libya, captured the capital city and the Tripoli airport after weeks of fighting a rival militia from the city of Zintan. The Dawn of Libya also pushed Zintan forces out of the U.S. compound. It was after these fights that the video at the pool was taken. After the video was released, leaders for the Dawn of Libya sought to clear the air and assure the rest of the world that their efforts were intended to secure the embassy compounds, rather than to loot and destroy American property. They even invited embassy workers to return. (That’s not likely to happen.) Dawn of Libya leaders allowed Associated Press reporters to view the facilities. They reported little damage to the residences and that "it didn’t appear that the villas in the compound had been ransacked." A commander for the Dawn of Libya told them, "This place is secure and under protection" and their forces were guarding the embassy from other militia groups." The State Department told the AP that the embassy in Tripoli was "secure." Experts we spoke with about Dawn of Libya cautioned that a lot of information and intelligence coming out of Libya is hazy. While "jihadist" is a vague term, it often suggests Islamic extremism that involves violence, terrorism and/or suicide attacks in the name of establishing a pure Islamic state. Under that definition, it would be a stretch to characterize Dawn of Libya as "jihadists," experts said. "That is a simplification that is absolutely ridiculous," said Karim Mezran, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. Mezran said using the term for Dawn of Libya lumps together groups fighting for political reasons with dangerous, terrorist organizations. The Dawn of Libya is an umbrella group that includes several local Islamic militias, but the bulk of its forces are made up of rebel fighters from the city of Misrata. They undertook some of the fiercest fighting against Gaddafi's forces during the Libyan revolution. While they support the Islamist party in government, they are not considered extremists. In fact, the group has turned down requests to join an alliance with Ansar al-Sharia, the terrorist organization responsible for the attacks two years ago on the Benghazi compound that resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens. Ansar al-Sharia is on the State Department terrorist watch list. Dawn of Libya is not. Ansar al-Sharia has called for the Dawn of Libya to unite under a "common banner," said Wayne White, a former deputy director of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research's Office of Analysis for the Near East and South Asia. "They rebuffed it harshly, saying, ‘We oppose terrorism, we oppose extremism,’" said White, now with the Middle East Institute. "It has shunned what could have been a valuable alliance of combination with the east to prove it’s not a terrorist or extreme militia." White added that it’s possible that within any organization there could be individuals or small groups of people who are extremists, and intelligence on the groups that have since joined the umbrella organization is incomplete. Still, history has shown the core group "has not been known for wild, murderous" attacks but rather as a "very proud military force that took the brunt of Gaddafi's forces" during the revolution, White said. Our ruling Paul said that in Tripoli, "jihadists today swim in our embassy pool." The claim stems from a video that shows members of the Dawn of Libya militia group diving into a pool. However, it has emerged that the pool wasn’t at the U.S. embassy, but rather at a residential annex a half-mile away. More critically, labeling the people in the video as "jihadists" is, at best, an exaggeration. The group in charge is a militia organization that is fighting a political and regional war, but it has rebuffed alliances with terrorist organizations. Reports from Tripoli suggest that the group has left the property largely intact, and U.S. officials have said the compound "remains secure."

pomt-03710	"Rick Scott has paid down our debt by about $2 billion. Charlie Crist’s debt went up about $5 billion."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/apr/17/lenny-curry/rpof-chair-lenny-curry-says-rick-scott-cut-state-d/	Gov. Rick Scott and his allies are eager to point out the "stark contrast" in Scott’s record with that of his predecessor and possible 2014 competitor, Charlie Crist. Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry compared the state debt under each governor in an April 15 interview with our Orlando TV partner, Central Florida News 13. Host Ybeth Bruzual asked Curry how Scott looks against Crist, who polls show would have a sizeable lead over Scott if he enters the governor’s race. "Look, they both have a record," Curry said. "Rick Scott has a record right now of close to 300,000 jobs created on his watch. Rick Scott has paid down our debt in Florida by about $2 billion. Our unemployment rate is now in a three/four year low. Under Charlie Crist, we lost over 800,000 jobs. Unemployment went from about 3 percent to over 11 percent. Charlie Crist's debt went up about $5 billion. The records couldn't be clearer." Those are Scott’s recent talking points almost verbatim. PolitiFact Florida looked at state debt under both governors and examined what role governors have over it in a January fact-check. Like Scott, Curry makes a decent point about the debt’s rise and fall in recent years. But he’s not telling the whole story. Let’s review. Counting the debt There are different ways to count the debt, and there are different ways to assign responsibility for it. We determined the amount of debt Florida accumulated during the Crist years from the archives of the Division of Bond Finance, which publishes an annual report on the debt picture. We used the most recent Debt Affordability Report to show the total outstanding debt over recent fiscal years. 2006: $23 billion 2007: $24.1 billion 2008: $24.3 billion 2009: $26.4 billion 2010: $28.2 billion 2011: $27.7 billion 2012: $26.2 billion Curry’s math works if you compare the fiscal year ending in 2006 with the one ending in 2010 (+$5.2 billion), and then 2010 with the 2012 fiscal year (-$2 billion). But some experts we consulted said the better way to compare debt between governors is by examining the budgets over which the governor actually had control to veto spending. Crist was elected in 2006 and took office in January 2007. That means the first budget he signed -- which included projects in need of bond financing -- covered the 2008 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2008. The last budget Crist signed was for the 2011 fiscal year, which ended six months into Scott’s tenure. So it’s more accurate to assess the growth of the debt under Crist from FY 2008 to FY 2011. This method produces an increase of $3.4 billion in debt, which is still large but not as big as the $5 billion Curry claimed. Now let’s look at Scott’s tenure. He took office in January 2011, so the first budget he signed covered the budget year running July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012. Under this measure, Scott reduced the debt only $1.5 billion. Still, no one denies the total debt fell sharply with Scott, who is famously debt-averse. It’s short of his $2 billion talking point now, but it probably won’t be when we get an analysis of debt from the 2012-13 budget, said Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of tax research, in January. "He’s only had one year that’s been reflected, but certainly I think we’ll find that last year was a relatively low bonding year as well," Wenner said. What was going on? Even during the worst of Florida’s recession, Florida borrowed money for capital projects while maintaining its credit ratings with various agencies. "We’ve been very well managed financially even during the downturn," said Ben Watkins, executive director of the state’s Division of Bond Finance, in January. "We’re very conservative." The sharp decline in debt is due to the state’s discontinued borrowing for acquiring conservation land and the decline of the state’s largest borrowing program, called Public Education Capital Outlay, or PECO, for public school, college and university construction projects. The decades-old program is paid for by a tax on electric, gas and telecommunications services, a source that has shriveled over recent years as Floridians conserve energy and ditch landline phones. In 2012, there was no PECO borrowing because of a serious drop-off in collections from the tax. Higher ed advocates said the PECO shortfall signaled a "crisis in infrastructure funding" that would limit the state’s ability to educate college students. At the University of South Florida, for example, a new learning center has gone unfinished as it awaits more PECO money. In his first year, Scott vetoed $474 million in bonds, including dozens of improvement and construction projects at state colleges and universities. Scott lowered debt issuance to $416 million, its lowest level since 1990 and significantly less than the $2 billion yearly average for the previous decade. Conversely, the rapid increase in debt after 2002 was driven mostly by the 2002 class-size amendment added to the Constitution by Florida voters that year. It required the Legislature to reduce class sizes by adding more classrooms. It cost the state $2.5 billion to build more class space, which included $1.9 billion in lottery revenue bonds, said David Jacobson, a spokesman for Moody’s Investors Service. That program is essentially over, he said, which contributes to the debt falling. As education commissioner, Crist said he supported the goal of reducing class size but was concerned with costs. Our ruling Curry is broadly correct: State debt increased under Crist and has decreased under Scott. But the numbers he uses are not accurate if you consider the budget years over which Crist could have exerted any control. Moreover, some bonds Florida issued were to pay for programs in the works before Crist took over, and the Legislature shares at least some of the blame for putting it in the budget. Finally, there was a spike in the debt after 2002 that was driven by a constitutional amendment to limit class sizes. Voters approved that measure, and the state government was required to put it into action. Consistent with our previous rating, we rate Curry’s claim Half True.

pomt-07341	"Gwinnett Medical Center is operating in the negative," in part, because of illegal immigrants.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/may/11/renee-unterman/illegal-immigrants-hurt-hospitals-bottom-line-geor/	A Georgia state senator recently shared some distressing news about one of metro Atlanta’s largest hospital systems. "Gwinnett Medical Center is operating in the negative," Renee Unterman, who represents a portion of Gwinnett County, said in a speech on the Senate floor. "And one of the reasons they are is because people are not paying their bills, and that includes illegal immigrants," she said. Unterman, a Republican, was making a speech in support of House Bill 87, legislation aimed at reducing illegal immigration in Georgia. The Senate, largely along party lines, voted in favor of the bill, which Gov. Nathan Deal has said he will sign into law. The former nurse said some people in her district complained to her that they couldn’t get inside the hospital’s emergency room because it is often filled with illegal immigrants. We wondered whether Unterman was correct about her claim. Gwinnett Medical Center spokeswoman Beth Okun confirmed that it had a negative operating margin so far this fiscal year, which ends June 30, by nearly $7 million. That’s about 2 percent of the system’s annual budget. Gwinnett Medical Center, Unterman said, had been in the black for several years beforehand. So why is Gwinnett Medical Center, which has medical facilities in Lawrenceville and Duluth, in financial trouble this fiscal year? Are illegal immigrants partially to blame for the red ink? Indigent care costs at Gwinnett Medical Center, which includes Medicare and Medicaid, have nearly quadrupled since 2000, according to our review of the center’s annual reports. Gwinnett Medical Center has a $20 million funding gap for Medicare reimbursements, Okun said to explain some of the shortfall. The center is receiving 80 cents in Medicare reimbursements for every dollar it spends on care for Medicare recipients, Okun said. Georgia Hospital Association spokesman Kevin Bloye said more Georgians are losing their health insurance, and hospitals are treating a larger percentage of uninsured patients, which likely includes illegal immigrants. Okun noted other financial problems. Gwinnett Medical Center is also short $1.1 million due to the provider fee, also known as the "bed tax," passed by state lawmakers in 2010. Gwinnett Medical Center has balanced its books, Okun said, by cutting some expenses and seeing an increase in its investment income. The hospital system cut 160 positions in November. Officials have stressed Gwinnett Medical Center is not in long-term financial danger. So is Unterman right about this funding shortage being the result, in part, of illegal immigrants without health insurance flooding the ER? There’s no clear way to answer that question, Okun and others said. Okun said the hospital system does not ask patients their immigration status. "The problem is we can’t quantify it," Bloye said. "Hospitals don’t ask patients whether they are legal or illegal." Georgia has an estimated 425,000 illegal immigrants, according to a February study by the Pew Hispanic Center, whose figures on such topics are widely accepted by political leaders and some government officials. That estimate accounts for about 4.4 percent of Georgia’s 9.7 million residents. The study does not estimate how much Georgia spends on health care for illegal immigrants. Research on the topic is scant. A 2006 report on immigrant health care costs in Los Angeles County by the RAND Corp., a nonprofit research organization, found per capita spending in a one-year period on illegal immigrant men and women was 39 percent and 54 percent, respectively, of native-born residents. The study also found illegal immigrants there made fewer visits to the doctor because they considered themselves in better health and had less access to health care. The Federation for American Immigration Reform, whose data is frequently used by some Georgia lawmakers, released a report in July and revised it in February that found Georgia spends more than $317 million a year on medical care for illegal immigrants. Those costs include Medicaid, the state’s children's health insurance program, PeachCare, and emergency childbirth. Georgia spends about $1.4 billion a year on Medicaid and PeachCare, state officials say. If both numbers are correct, illegal immigrants account for 22 percent of such costs. FAIR included U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, but the Constitution guarantees citizenship to any child born in this country. Some organizations have accused FAIR of xenophobia. The Washington, D.C.-based organization has been critical of the federal government’s efforts to halt illegal immigrants from working inside the U.S. Unterman noted in her speech to lawmakers that the federal Hill-Burton Act, which requires some health care facilities to provide free or reduced care if a patient can’t afford it, does not require U.S. citizenship for eligibility. It does, however, maintain that a recipient must have lived in the United States for at least three months. The senator said Philip Wolfe, the chief executive officer of the Gwinnett Medical Center, explained some of its financial problems before this year’s legislative session began. Unterman told us she did not have scientific research about the financial impact of illegal immigrants on Gwinnett Medical Center, but she said she believes there is a significant impact by some of the calls she has received from people in her district. "I think it’s pretty serious when you get calls from your constituents," Unterman told us. We found that Unterman was correct about Gwinnett Medical Center’s troubled finances for the current budget year. The senator could also be right about illegal immigrants being part of the reason why the center is "in the negative." But there are no concrete numbers on how much illegal immigrants are costing the center. They could be a major burden to its finances or a minor blip on the spreadsheet. Under current reporting requirements, the numbers just aren’t verifiable. Without that additional information, we rate Unterman’s claim as Half True.

pomt-08013	Says he "had to impose tougher cost controls on state employees than" any previous Wisconsin governor.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/11/jim-doyle/former-wisconsin-gov-jim-doyle-says-he-imposed-tou/	Reflecting on his tenure as Wisconsin’s second-longest-serving governor, Democrat Jim Doyle was asked about a "dust-up" between Wisconsin Republicans and state employee unions. Republicans, in the days leading up to the Dec. 19, 2010 interview, had talked of restricting the unions’ power and making Wisconsin a "right-to-work" state. "Well, that’s serious," Doyle said on WISN-TV’s "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a Milwaukee public affairs program. Then he added: "I’ve made deeper cuts than any governor’s ever made and I’ve had to impose tougher cost controls on state employees than anybody’s made." The second claim made us wonder: Was Doyle, who served eight years, tougher than every previous Wisconsin governor when it comes to "cost controls" on state employees? After all, it’s been more than 162 years since 35-year-old Nelson Dewey was elected the state’s first governor in 1848. It isn’t possible, of course, to closely examine the administrations of all 43 of Doyle’s predecessors, and the size and scope of state government has changed so much that cross-generational comparisons may not be valid. But statistics and interviews with experts provided a solid picture of the past 40 years. There are two things to keep in mind about that period: First, with the Great Recession, Doyle’s tenure coincided with worst economic period of those 40 years, which prompted many of the actions he took. Second, the period does not include the Great Depression, when the state also took some very stark actions to curtail costs. We started with Doyle, asking his aides to provide support for the claim that he took stronger steps than any other governor. Just before turning the office over to Republican Scott Walker on Jan. 3, aides cited five areas in which Doyle cut or curtailed expenditures for state employees. They made no effort to compare him to previous administrations. The areas: Wages Doyle spokesman Adam Collins said Doyle kept pay raises low throughout his two terms and, in the 2007-2009 state budget, saved $62 million by rescinding 2 percent raises for non-union employees. We asked the Office of State Employment Relations for figures as far back as it could go. Under Doyle, raises averaged 1.21 percent per year -- less than under the previous four elected governors dating back to 1971. The raises under those governors: Republican Tommy Thompson, the longest-serving governor (1987-2001), 1.79 percent; Democrat Anthony Earl (1983-1987), 3.96 percent; Republican Lee Dreyfus (1979-1983), 8.5 percent; and Democrat Patrick Lucey (1971-1977), 6.91 percent. Health insurance Collins said changes made in 2005 raised premiums for employees who were already paying them and required premium payments from employees who weren’t paying any. We sought details from the Department of Employee Trust Funds, which said the portion of premiums paid by employees more than doubled under Doyle, from 2.5 percent in 2003 to 5.6 percent in 2011. Pensions Collins said the vast majority of state employees paid nothing toward their pensions until January 2011, when they were required to contribute 0.2 percent -- two-tenths of 1 percent -- of their pay. Bob Conlin, deputy secretary of the Department of Employee Trust Funds, told us the change applies to about 90 percent of employees and is estimated to save the state more than $6.6 million per year in pension contributions. Furloughs Collins pointed out that Doyle required employees to take eight unpaid furlough days in both the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 budget years, saving an estimated $208 million over the two-year period. The furloughs amounted to a 3 percent pay cut. Unfilled jobs Collins said that over 10 percent of the 33,000 positions authorized by the Legislature (not including the University of Wisconsin System) were vacant when Doyle left office. So that is the case made by Doyle. He took office facing an estimated $3.2 billion deficit, pledging to trim 10,000 state jobs -- a promise he did not deliver on. He left office with the state, and his successor, facing a comparable deficit. For perspective, we turned to five experts to see how Doyle compares. We also asked them if measures other than those cited by Doyle should be taken into consideration in terms of employee cost controls. Three experts said Doyle controlled employee costs more than any previous governor for at least the past 40 years: Edward Miller, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point political science professor. He said Dreyfus rescinded raises, Earl provided no raises during his first in year office and various governors imposed hiring freezes, but overall Doyle did more employee cost controls than any governor since at least 1970. Mordecai Lee, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professor of governmental affairs. He said no governor has imposed more significant employee cost controls than Doyle since at least 1970. Lee is a former Democratic state lawmaker. Dennis Dresang, University of Wisconsin-Madison public affairs and political science professor emeritus: While Doyle didn’t resort to layoffs, as Wisconsin governors during the Great Depression and other periods did, he "certainly is someone who saw (employee) costs as a place for getting savings in the budget." Dresang and others did not have a trove of information about the Great Depression. The state Historical Society pointed us to the state Bureau of Personnel’s biennial report for 1932-1934, early in the Great Depression. It showed state employees suffered pay cuts as high as 25 percent. The other two other experts we consulted were George Lightbourn, president of the conservative Wisconsin Policy Research Institute and secretary of the Department of Administration under Thompson and McCallum; and University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh public affairs professor Craig Maher, an expert in state government finance. Neither cited another Wisconsin governor who did tougher employee cost controls than Doyle. But they said Doyle’s actions should be compared not to prior Wisconsin governors, but to U.S. governors who served when he did, given that they were confronted by the worst economy since the Depression. Maher noted a June 2010 study by the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers. It found that, unlike Doyle, 26 governors ordered layoffs and nine cut employee benefits in the 2009-2010 budget year. Let’s size things up. Doyle said he did more than any previous Wisconsin governor in controlling state employee costs. Doyle did limit pay raises, make some pay cuts and make employees pay more for benefits. It’s difficult to do a valid governor-by-governor comparison across the generations, so based on available statistics and consulting with experts, we went back 40 years. For that time frame, experts agreed Doyle’s claim was correct for that period -- but noted his actions were largely a product of the time during which he served. We rate Doyle’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-04890	"Without Westside MAX, we’d need to add 2.9 lanes to the Sunset Highway."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/aug/06/trimet/would-we-need-add-29-lanes-sunset-highway-if-not-w/	TriMet recently ran ads in some editions of The Oregonian claiming that "without Westside MAX, we’d need to add 2.9 lanes to the Sunset Highway." For those drivers lucky enough not to experience the hell that is a Sunset Highway commute, know that TriMet is talking about the portion of U.S. 26 that carries vehicles between downtown Portland and Washington County. The lanes are jammed during commute hours, and we’re pretty sure some drivers would love to add an extra 2.9 lanes anyway to relieve congestion. Light-rail trains parallel some of the highway, but not all of it. Our question was simple: We wanted to know how TriMet, the metro area’s public transit agency, calculated the need to add 2.9 lanes of highway if not for westside MAX. TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch got back to us with a calculation prepared by staff; the explanation clarified that the figure should be 2.7 lanes. (This is not the first time a query by PolitiFact Oregon has prompted a revised figure. There’s just something about us that makes people correct themselves.) Here’s the calculation: Basically, TriMet checked how many times a light-rail train went through the Washington Park station (westbound) and through the Sunset Transit Center station (eastbound) between 4:30 and 5:30 in the evening in Spring 2011. The total was 20 trips, or trains. Each two-car train can carry a maximum, or full load of, 266 people, according to TriMet. If you multiply 266 by 20 trains, that’s a maximum 5,320 people on light-rail that pass through those points in that one-hour period. Compare that to the 2,052 people estimated in one highway lane over the hour. (That’s using a standard 1,800 vehicles per hour multiplied by an occupancy rate of 1.14 people per auto during a commute. ) So the maximum number of people on MAX over that hour is equivalent to the number of people on 2.6 lanes. Hence 2.6 added lanes. Again, that was in spring 2011. TriMet added another train this spring, bringing the total number of trains to 21, which translates into the revised figure of 2.7 added lanes and a maximum capacity of 5,586 riders. Next, we turned to John Charles of the Cascade Policy Institute, who is the libertarian think tank’s leading critic of light-rail transit. He contested TriMet’s claim on several fronts, including the theory that the analysis doesn’t account for people who could have been carried by bus if TriMet hadn’t reduced bus service for light-rail. But the most interesting suggestion he made was that maximum capacity doesn’t matter; actual ridership matters. We asked Fetsch for the number of riders on those trains. Weekday ridership for the 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. peak hour in spring 2012 averaged 1,673 westbound and 938 eastbound for a total of 2,611 riders. That’s not close to the maximum capacity of 5,586 riders and, using TriMet’s own calculations, comes to 1.3 added lanes. Fetsch said TriMet’s intent was not to suggest that they would need to build 2.7 lanes to the highway corridor, which probably isn’t possible anyway unless you demolish some hills. "Our intent was to describe the mobility capacity of MAX in terms that people could relate to who travel within that corridor," she wrote in an email. But that’s not what the ad says. It clearly states we would "need to add" lanes. That indicates that without westside MAX, we’d need that many more lanes to maintain the traffic flow we have now. TriMet may have the capacity to carry the equivalent of 2.7 lanes, but that’s not what the ad said. There’s an element of truth in the statement. TriMet can show a method by which it translates carrying capacity into highway lanes. TriMet may have the capacity to carry the equivalent of 2.7 lanes, but its trains weren’t carrying anywhere near that many people at the time of the estimate. And with that, we wish commuters good luck and rate the statement Mostly False.	None	TriMet	None	None	None	2012-08-06T17:10:11	2012-07-07	['U.S._Route_26_in_Oregon', 'MAX_Blue_Line']
pomt-01688	Says the former president of the Czech Republic said the American people were a "confederacy of fools" for electing Barack Obama.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/14/chain-email/chain-email-says-former-czech-president-called-ame/	We recently came across a chain email that seems to have been floating around the Internet since President Barack Obama’s first months in office and is still making the rounds, five years later. Without providing any context, the email quotes Vaclav Klaus, former president of the Czech Republic, as saying the American people must be a "confederacy of fools" to have elected Obama. "The danger to America is not Barack Obama, but a citizenry capable of entrusting a man like him with the presidency. It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America. Blaming the prince of the fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince. The republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools, such as those who made him their president." Those are pretty harsh words to come from a head-of-state, particularly one with whom Obama seems to have a decent relationship. But after scouring the Internet, we found zero evidence that Klaus ever said this. Some context: Klaus was president of the Czech Republic from 2003 to 2013, when he was impeached on treason charges. The charges were later dropped, but he did not resume his post. He is now a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. Some others, including Snopes.com, have tried to debunk the attribution years ago. The quote has been floating around on blogs, email chains and comment boards since at least early 2009 and has had many attributions. We’ll go through a few. The earliest sighting we found was from April 30, 2009 -- just under five months after Obama took office -- on a personal, right-wing blog. That post said the quote came from "Prager Zeitungon, a Czech newspaper." This appears to be a misspelling of the weekly Prager Zeitung. However, there is no online record of this quote ever having been published in the newspaper, and as of today the search engine only pulls up 13 articles with the word "Obama" in them -- all written since 2012. A similar but unattributed quote (with some additions) was posted in December 2009, on another personal blog that no longer exists. We also found the quote unattributed in a 2010 self-published e-book called We the People: A Christian Nation (page 47) by Richard McKenzie. It even appeared in print, as a May 2010 letter-to-the-editor in The Salisbury Post, a newspaper in North Carolina. Funnily enough, this quote has gone global. People in several other countries have swapped out "Obama" and "America" for their own leaders and countries. Possibly the most often-occurring version after the American one is from South Africa. It replaces Obama’s name with Jacob Zuma, their president, elected in 2009. Many people posting that version have attributed it to a Czech economics professor named Ken Peters. We can’t find an economics professor by that name -- Czech or otherwise -- associated with anything other than that quote. The quote has also been adapted for politicians in other countries. It's appeared in posts and comments in New Zealand, Australia, the Northern Mariana Islands, Nigeria, Lesotho and Zambia. Our ruling A chain email said the former president of the Czech Republic said the American people were a "confederacy of fools" for electing Obama. This quote has had various attributions since it first appeared on the Internet more than five years ago. The quote’s true origins may be forever buried far down in the depths of the Internet, but we’re sure it didn’t come from Klaus. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-04820	"Austin is the largest city in the U.S. or Texas with no geographic representation" on its city council.	true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/17/austinites-geographic-representation/austin-group-says-austin-biggest-us-city-lacking-c/	A handout making the case for electing Austin City Council members from small-scale districts rather than continuing to elect each one citywide says: "Geographic representation brings government and people together." We don’t know how to check that. But our attention was drawn to the next bullet point on the leaflet paid for by Austinites for Geographic Representation: "Austin is the largest city in the U.S. or Texas with no geographic representation." Once we sorted out what that means, we wondered if it was so. Austin’s council consists of the mayor and six members, each one elected citywide. But Austin voters on Nov. 6, 2012, will be offered two plans that would change how council members are elected. One, put on the ballot by the council, would lead to eight members elected from districts with the mayor and two members elected citywide, according to an Aug. 7, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, The other proposal, which made the ballot after Austinites for Geographic Representation collected more than 20,000 petition signatures, would result in 10 district-elected representatives with the mayor chosen by citywide vote. According to the story, a district plan must get more than half the vote to pass. If both plans clear that hurdle, the one with the most votes would take effect. We asked the group for backup on the leaflet claim, and volunteer Art Olbert told us that he earlier checked how city councils are elected in the bigger cities by looking up each city government online. At our request, Olbert replicated his work by starting from a U.S. Census breakdown of the nation’s most populous cities showing that as of July 2011, Austin ranked 13th, with 820,611 residents. Olbert shortly sent us his chart indicating that in the cities bigger than Austin, including three Texas cities, at least some council members are elected from geographic districts. We confirmed that analysis by visiting his cited sites or similar ones. Upshot: The larger-than-Austin U.S. cities of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose, Jacksonville and Indianapolis all elect all or some council members from districts. (In Texas, too, Fort Worth and El Paso elect council members from single-member districts.) Eight of the other cities elect council members solely from districts, while the other cities -- Houston, Philadelphia, Jacksonville and Indianapolis -- elect most members from districts, choosing a few at large. Our detailed counts are posted here. Our ruling Each of the dozen U.S. cities bigger than Austin has a city council with members elected from geographic districts -- and eight solely elect members from districts. This claim rates True.

Romney accuses President Barack Obama of mismanagement when GM and Chrysler were on the verge of collapse in late 2008 and early 2009. He says the car manufacturers should have been allowed to go bankrupt and that Obama practiced "crony capitalism" in negotiating with union bosses. And in a CNN debate on Feb. 22, 2012, Romney said, "the president gave the companies to the UAW." Here, we’ll take a look at that last claim. The bailouts In late 2008, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors were mired in crisis. The companies needed immediate cash, or they faced collapse. President George W. Bush authorized initial loans to Chrysler and GM (Ford declined) before leaving office. Then the problem ended up in the new president’s lap. The Obama administration extended billions more in loans and led a restructuring of the two companies in which the government took an equity share in GM and Chrysler. Critics, including Romney, said the auto makers should have gone through the normal bankruptcy process. "A managed bankruptcy may be the only path to the fundamental restructuring the industry needs. It would permit the companies to shed excess labor, pension and real estate costs," he wrote in a November 2008 op-ed in the New York Times. But others pointed out that, with the credit markets frozen and the wider economy in dire straits, the car companies wouldn’t get private financing and would go out of business. During the process, the United Auto Workers, the union representing car company employees and retirees, made concessions to help the companies stop bleeding. We consulted several sources for an explanation on what each side gave. In sum, the union eased demands on wages, overtime pay, job security and, most significantly, health benefits. In 2007, the union and car companies had agreed to hand over management of retiree health benefits to a trust fund. The companies agreed to put money in the fund, and the union assumed the uncertainties of rising health care costs and investment fluctuations. But in 2009, the car companies were on the brink and had no cash to put in the fund. The alternative contribution: company stock. That’s how an independent health care trust for UAW beneficiaries ended up owning Chrysler and GM stock. As of February 2012, the trust holds a 41.5 percent stake in Chrysler and a 10.3 percent stake in General Motors. A bit about the politics Obama was accused of structuring a deal that gave more to the union -- a heavy backer of Democrats in both votes and campaign money -- than a bankruptcy judge would have done. "Unquestionably, the Obama administration gave its political allies in the United Auto Workers a better deal than the union would have gotten from a private-equity firm or a Republican president," Charles Lane wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post. "UAW workers accepted layoffs and lower wages for future hires -- but no current wage reduction, like those accepted by workers in many other distressed industries." On the other hand, UAW President Bob King estimated that each union member has sacrificed $7,000 to $30,000 in annual compensation, either in pay or benefits, since 2005, according to a story in the New York Times. To Romney, who also wrote an op-ed piece on this subject, the deal amounted to "crony capitalism on a grand scale." His campaign did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Analyzing the statement Here’s one important point: The stock is owned by an independent health care trust called the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust, not the UAW itself. (The trust is also often referred to by the acronym VEBA.) A 2011 letter to its 840,000 beneficiaries said the trust is "a separate entity, independent of the auto companies and the UAW. The trust has its own assets. The assets in the trust are not the property of the auto companies or the UAW. Instead, those assets are held in the trust on behalf of the covered retirees. Those assets can only be used to provide medical benefits to UAW retirees and their families. Neither the UAW nor the auto companies can use those assets for any other purpose." The letter further explains that the UAW appoints five of the 11 members -- a minority -- to the trust’s board. Next, we talked to a couple of industry analysts for their take on Romney’s statement, again, that Obama "gave the (auto) companies to the union." "Giveaway is not the right word because the unions gave up cash payments. They took on some risk," said Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman of edmunds.com, a consumer-oriented automotive website. "For the union there was no guarantee." Steve Rattner, who served as Obama’s "car czar" told us in an email, "the ownership wasn't ‘given’ to the VEBA; the VEBA received it in return for giving up very large claims it held against the company." Kristin Dziczek with the Center for Automotive Research, added that the union members were also creditors in this situation because the car companies were contractually obligated to pay for their health benefits. "The retiree health care trust was owed billions of dollars," she said. And since the car companies didn’t have the billions on hand, they chipped in equity instead. In the case of GM, the stock could be sold at any time, Dziczek said. But since Chrysler is not a publicly traded company, the UAW health trust is stuck with it for now. Rattner added that the stocks didn’t come with voting rights. So did Obama give the car companies to the union? Said Dziczek: "The majority stakeholder in Chrysler is Fiat. (The health care trust) is not the majority stakeholder in GM. They don’t have a voting seat as a result of this. They don’t have a vote on the board. They’re not managing the company." "Who is running these companies? Not the UAW." Our ruling Romney, in the debate, said "the president gave the (auto) companies to the UAW." The reality is Obama was in charge of a bailout deal that resulted in the union’s health care trust owning stock in Chrysler and GM. But the trust was owed money to pay for health care under the terms of labor contracts the car companies signed. And the union "gave" plenty too -- in the form of wages, vacation and job security. In that light, the arrangement was a tradeoff, not a giveaway. What tips Romney’s claim even further from reality is the fact that the union itself does not own any GM or Chrysler stock. The trust that manages health benefits for retirees is the stockholder, and it is independent from the UAW. It is not a majority shareholder in either company, nor does it have a vote on the board. All the experts we talked to agreed that Romney’s statement is just flat wrong. Our ruling: False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-02-27T14:21:50	2012-02-22	['None']
pomt-07790	Says some in Congress are trying "to create a separate government for those with a drop of Native Hawaiian blood."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/20/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-some-congress-are-trying-create-se/	In his book Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington, Gov. Rick Perry envisions a time when "race-based thinking is relegated to the bigot in the corner and not embraced by our nation's laws." Among the examples of "race-based thinking," he writes, is "the mind-boggling effort of some in Congress to create a separate government for those with a drop of Native Hawaiian blood (just Google it — it's unbelievable)." Alrighty. We typed "Native Hawaiian government" and "drop of blood" into Google. That led us to websites and opinion articles critical of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, known as the Akaka Bill after Democratic U.S. Sen. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, who has been proposing the legislation in Congress since 2000. Among the critiques was a Feb. 17, 2009, letter from retired college professor Kenneth Conklin to President Barack Obama urging him to oppose the legislation. Conklin, who maintains a website opposing the legislation and has written a book, Hawaiian Apartheid — Racial Separatism and Ethnic Nationalism in the Aloha State, says in the letter: "The whole purpose of the Akaka Bill is to divide the lands and people of Hawaii along racial lines, to declare that the descendants of natives should be a hereditary elite with a racially exclusionary government walling out all who lack a drop of the magic blood." That's not what Akaka says on a Web page promoting his proposal. The page, titled "Native Hawaiian Federal Recognition," says his legislation outlines "a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian governing entity for the purpose of establishing a federally recognized government-to-government relationship with the United States, consistent with U.S. policy towards its indigenous peoples." The site also says "the federal policy of self-governance and self-determination has not yet been formally extended to Native Hawaiians" and that his proposal is intended to achieve parity among indigenous American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians. A Dec. 22 Associated Press news article says: "Native Hawaiians are the last remaining indigenous people in the United States that haven't been allowed to establish their own government, a right already extended to Alaska Natives and Native American tribes." There have been many versions of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act over the years, though Akaka spokesman Jesse Broder Van Dyke told us its main goal — federal recognition and self-governance for Native Hawaiians — hasn't changed. We looked at the legislation that was in the congressional pipeline when Perry was writing his book last year. After passing the House in February 2010, it stalled in the Senate. Would anyone with "a drop of Native Hawaiian blood" be subject to the proposed new government, as Perry claims? Turns out, the bill doesn't set a minimum percentage of native blood for those who would qualify to be a member — the equivalent of a citizen — of the new entity. Such details will be decided during the drafting of the entity's governing documents, which would be subject to federal certification. However, the legislation does set an ancestry requirement for those who want to join the "roll" of Native Hawaiians who will help set up the entity, including by taking part in the writing of the governing documents; they would have to be "direct lineal descendants" of Hawaii's indigenous people. According to Black's Law Dictionary, a lineal descendant is a blood relative in the direct line of descent — children, grandchildren, and so on. Out of 317 federally recognized tribes, 98 have no blood requirement and instead determine membership by lineal descent, according to "Changing Numbers, Changing Needs: American Indian Demography and Public Health," a research volume published in 1996. According to a provision that Van Dyke says was added to the legislation in late 2009, members of the roll must also demonstrate that they have "a significant cultural, social, or civic connection to the Native Hawaiian community." Finally, we looked at whether the Native Hawaiian governing entity would operate as a "separate government," as Perry says. Akaka says on his Web page that members of the entity would be subject to the jurisdiction of state and federal courts, as well as state regulation, taxation and legislative authority. The legislation doesn't create a reservation in Hawaii or authorize private lands to be taken, the page says. The entity could enter into negotiations with the federal government and State of Hawaii over land transfers, but resulting agreements would need federal and state authorization to become effective, according to the page. The entity could not create its own military nor secede from the United States. Testifying before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on Aug. 6, 2009, Sam Hirsch, deputy associate attorney general in the U.S. Justice Department, said that "in recognizing a Native Hawaiian sovereign entity, Congress would in effect determine that Native Hawaiians constitute a distinct community as it has done with Indian tribes." According to an October 2005 Congressional Research Service analysis of the proposal: "That tribes are governments having rights over their land and populace is a foundational element in the federal government’s relationship with Indians." But some question whether Congress has the authority to equate Native Hawaiians with American Indians. Most tribes have long lived together under tribal governments, said Stuart Benjamin, a professor at Duke University School of Law, in his testimony before the Senate committee. But Native Hawaiians are a more diverse, loosely connected — and dispersed — people, he said, quoting U.S. Census Bureau data indicating that more than 40 percent of the population lives outside the state. "No tribe has ever had the paucity of connections that exist among Native Hawaiians," Benjamin said. In a Dec. 7 letter to Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. senators, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights reiterated its 2006 opposition to the Akaka measure or any legislation that would "discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege." So how does Perry's Google-it statement shake out? The proposal would authorize a separate government for Native Hawaiians, one that proponents say would give the group the same right to self-governance extended to other indigenous people. However, the legislation doesn't specify ancestry requirements — drops of blood or otherwise — for those who would ultimately be represented by the proposed government.

pomt-13074	"The @nytimes states today that DJT believes ‘more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.’ How dishonest are they. I never said this!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-tweets-he-never-said-more-cou/	Two days after telling CBS that he planned to be "very restrained" on social media going forward, President-elect Donald Trump lashed out at the New York Times on Twitter. "Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the ‘Trump phenomena,’" Trump tweeted Nov. 13. The New York Times communications team responded to say the news organization actually had a surge in digital and print subscriptions after the election. He also tweeted, wrongly, "The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?" He’s referring to a Nov. 13 letter from the news organization’s editor and publisher, in which they thank readers for their loyalty and admit that they underestimated support for Trump. The letter does not include an apology. Lastly, Trump wrote, "The @nytimes states today that DJT believes ‘more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.’ How dishonest are they. I never said this!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com New York Times reporter Max Fisher did, in fact, write about Trump's nuclear views on Nov. 11 as part of a larger story about Trump's foreign policy. The line in question contained a touch more nuance than Trump's tweet: "Trump has suggested that more countries should acquire nuclear weapons, to protect themselves without Washington’s help." Fisher has it right. Trump has said it might not be such a bad thing if South Korea and Japan were to develop their own nuclear weapons in self-defense — including in interviews with, you guessed it, the New York Times. While Trump’s stated positions on nuclear proliferation are often contradictory, it is highly misleading for him to say that he "never said" more countries should acquire nuclear weapons. "Mr. Trump has indicated that countries need to defend themselves and that nuclear weapons are an option that they have, but not that he supports them having those weapons," Trump spokesman Steven Cheung told PolitiFact for a prior article on this subject. Here are some of Trump’s key comments about whether more countries should have nuclear weapons. March 27, 2016 The New York Times asked Trump if he’d object to Japan or South Korea having nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. Trump responded, "At some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world. And unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has them. You have, probably, North Korea has them. ... And, would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also? You may very well be better off if that’s the case. In other words, where Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem." He added later in the same interview: "If Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us." March 29, 2016 CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Trump, "If you're concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn't that proliferation?" As part of a meandering response, Trump said that he both opposes nuclear proliferation ("No, no, not proliferation. I hate nuclear more than any," and "I don't want more nuclear weapons") and supports some countries obtaining nuclear weapons for the first time. "Wouldn't you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?" he asked Cooper. Cooper also asked Trump: "Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?" Trump: "Saudi Arabia, absolutely." Cooper: "You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?" Trump: "No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves, or they have to pay us." April 3, 2016 Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace asked Trump, "You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?" Trump said, "In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes." Trump later added of Japan and South Korea, "Maybe they would be better off — including with nukes, yes, including with nukes." May 4, 2016 CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump, "You're ready to let Japan and South Korea become nuclear powers?" Trump responded, "I am prepared to, if they're not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and police for the world." Our ruling Trump tweeted, "The @nytimes states today that DJT believes ‘more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.’ How dishonest are they. I never said this!" Trump accused the New York Times of mispresenting his belief, but the newspaper did not. The reporter portrayed his comments on arming other countries with nuclear weapons as something Trump "has suggested" to further U.S. security interests. Trump has said he is opposed to nuclear proliferation while also repeatedly saying some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, might be "better off" if they were to develop nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. He even made such comments to the New York Times.

pomt-12523	"They voted for (a border wall) in 2006. Then-Senator Obama voted for it. Sen. Schumer voted for it. Sen. Clinton voted for it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/23/mick-mulvaney/fact-check-did-top-democrats-vote-border-wall-2006/	White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said he doesn’t understand Democratic opposition to funding the border wall because top Democrats voted for it just over 10 years ago. During an April 23 segment on Fox News Sunday, Mulvaney talked down concerns about a government shutdown, but scolded Democrats for obstructing action on Trump’s border wall. Mulvaney pointed to the voting record of top Democrats in 2006 to explain his confusion. "We want our priorities funded and one of the biggest priorities during the campaign was border security, keeping Americans safe, and part of that was a border wall," he said. "We still don’t understand why the Democrats are so wholeheartedly against it. They voted for it in 2006. Then-Sen. Obama voted for it. Sen. Schumer voted for it. Sen. Clinton voted for it. So we don’t understand why Democrats are now playing politics just because Donald Trump is in office." Mulvaney is referencing their votes on an act that authorized a fence, but as we’ve noted several times in the past, the 2006 fence was less ambitious than the wall Trump is proposing. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico. The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. At the time the act was being considered, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer were all members of the Senate. (Schumer of New York is now the Senate minority leader.) Obama, Clinton, Schumer and 23 other Democratic senators voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19. Originally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. Currently, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. So how does that compare to Trump’s wall? Trump plans for the wall are vague, but here’s what we know. He said the wall doesn’t need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher. Experts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence are not too significant because both block people. Still, there are obvious differences between the fence and Trump’s wall proposal. A 2016 Associated Press report from the border described "rust-colored thick bars" that form "teeth-like slats" 18 feet high. "There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself," the report said. Trump criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign. "Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad," Trump said. (Actually, the project didn’t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.) It’s also worth noting that the political context surrounding the 2006 vote was different, too. Democrats normally in favor of looser immigration laws saw the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils, according to a Boston Globe report that detailed the legislative process. Around that same time, the House passed legislation that would make any undocumented immigrant a felon. "It didn’t have anywhere near the gravity of harm," Angela Kelley, who in 2006 was the legislative director for the National Immigration Forum, told the Boston Globe. "It was hard to vote against it because who is going to vote against a secure fence? And it was benign compared with what was out there." Democrats have described Trump’s wall proposal as overkill and too expensive. Recently, Democrats penned a letter to Senate GOP saying border funding should not be included in the latest budget agreement to keep the government open. Our ruling Mulvaney said that Obama, Schumer and Clinton voted for a border wall in 2006. They did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. Still, the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a "nothing wall." Mulvaney’s statement is partially accurate, but ignores important context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04737	"When President Obama took office, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month. Now we've had job growth, I think, for 24 consecutive months."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/30/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-united-states-has-been/	In the contest for the hearts and minds of voters, Democrats have been claiming that the economy is really improving and the Republicans have been saying they can make the anemic recovery even more robust. During the online-only portion of the Aug. 28 Providence Journal-WPRI debate among Democrats David Cicilline and Anthony Gemma, both running in the 1st Congressional District, incumbent Cicilline was asked how he would tackle the massive national debt. Cicilline said that in addition to cutting spending and closing loopholes in the tax system, the pace of job creation needs to increase. "When President Obama took office, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month. Now we've had job growth, I think, for 24 consecutive months," he said. We've heard a lot of chatter about the job numbers and whether they really indicate a recovery, so we decided to look further. First, a look at what the employment situation was like when Obama took office. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that in January 2009, when the president was sworn in, the country lost 818,000 jobs. (The numbers do not include farm workers and are adjusted for seasonal shifts in employment, but that's the standard way of calculating employment and unemployment rates.) That's 17 percent more than the 700,000 jobs Cicilline cited. (To put the numbers in perspective, the losses for the first three full months that Obama was in office averaged 738,000 per month. The average job loss for the last three full months of the Bush administration was 651,000.) When it comes to the number of months in which the United States has had job growth, Cicilline's timeframe was also somewhat off. BLS data show that the last time the United States lost jobs was in September 2010, when 27,000 jobs were lost. That's 22 months ago, not 24. How significant have the increases been? Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution told PolitiFact National in May that the economy needs to create 90,000 to 100,000 jobs each month just to keep pace with the number of people coming into the work force. During 7 of those 22 months, including as recently as April, May and June of this year, job growth was below 100,000. In 8 of the 22 months, it was over 200,000. When we asked his campaign for the source of Cicilline's statement, spokeswoman Nicole Kayner sent us a White House blog item from Aug. 3 reporting: "The economy has now added private sector jobs for 29 straight months." We confirmed that with the BLS database, but this is for non-government jobs, and Cicilline didn't make that distinction in his debate comment. Our ruling In the debate, U.S. Rep. David Cicilline said: "When President Obama took office, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month. Now we've had job growth, I think, for 24 consecutive months." We want to note, as we repeatedly have, that even though there's been improvement in the job numbers during the Obama administration, a president's ability to influence the economy is severely limited. As for Cicilline’s comment, he understated the job losses occurring when President Obama took office and, by the most commonly used measure, he overstated by two months the timespan of continued job growth. But his main point -- that there has been growth for nearly two years -- is sound. Because the statement is "accurate but needs clarification or additional information," we rule it Mostly True.

pomt-11431	"Democrats announce they will abolish ICE if they win 2020 election."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/15/blog-posting/website-claims-democrats-plan-abolish-ice-if-they-/	Have Democrats announced plans to abolish one of the nation’s immigration enforcement agencies if they win the 2020 presidential election? That’s the headline of a March 11 story on yournewswire.com, but the text of the story did not support that claim, offering only calls from editorial writers and no presidential politicians as evidence. Some left-leaning media outlets, immigrant rights advocates and a former spokesman for the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign have suggested ending U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but that’s different from claiming it will be part of a candidate’s platform. Here’s more to the story and it’s misleading headline. "Senior Democrats have announced plans to completely abolish ICE if a Democratic candidate wins the presidential election in 2020," said the March 11 post. "According to sources within the DNC, the abolition of the nation’s immigration enforcement agency looks likely to become a primary campaign issue in the Democrats’ 2020 presidential primary." No sources were named. We reached out to the Democratic National Committee for comment but did not get a response. The story includes a few sentences contradicting its overarching claim. It said that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was asked on MSNBC if ICE should exist, and that her answer — "certainly" — "sparked a backlash among some liberals." (In the interview, Harris said undocumented immigrants should be deported if they commit serious and violent offenses. "ICE has a purpose. ICE has a role. ICE should exist.") Political pundits have speculated that Harris might run for president in 2020. But her stance of keeping ICE goes against yournewswire.com’s claim that Democrats announced they will abolish ICE if they win the 2020 election. The story does include legitimate examples of others calling for an end to ICE, including statements from Brian Fallon, former Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman, and posts published by some media organizations. Fallon on Jan. 21, 2018 tweeted that Democratic candidates in 2020 "should campaign on ending the agency in its current form." Jack Mirkinson, a news editor for the website Splinter, took it further in a story responding to Harris’ MSNBC interview, writing, "ICE must be abolished. Anything less is not good enough." The Nation published a piece on March 9 from researcher and writer Sean McElwee headlined, "It’s Time to Abolish ICE." Yournewswire.com notes that The Nation’s piece quotes Angel Padilla, policy director of the Indivisible Project, which describes itself as working to "to defeat the Trump agenda, elect progressive leaders, and realize bold progressive policies." Yournewswire.com included a tweet by MSNBC host Chris Hayes that linked to McElwee’s article and wrote, "This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it." The Nation’s story mentions several Democrats running for Congress and for state offices who support defunding ICE. But it does not cite Democrats with plans to run for president in 2020 calling for ICE’s abolition. While there are calls from some Democrats running for state offices and Congress to defund ICE, yournewswire.com’s post offers no evidence of presidential hopefuls making such claims. It actually cites one possible presidential contender, Harris from California, as saying ICE should exist. We rate yournewswire.com’s post False.

pomt-11527	"The president is cutting the CDC budget by 80%.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/feb/16/bobbie-richardson/nc-democrat-says-trumps-cutting-cdc-budget-80-perc/	In his first year as president, Donald Trump made it clear that he wants to cut some government programs. He signed an executive order instructing budget writers to root out waste in the federal government. And his proposed budget included cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as education programs. Trump’s moves have sparked outcry among Democrats, who have argued that the cuts will make government less effective and endanger the environment. In North Carolina, state Rep. Bobbie Richardson recently took to Twitter to raise alarm about Trump’s latest budget proposal and how it affects the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Richardson, a three-term representative from Louisburg, is the Democratic whip in the state House. "The president is cutting the CDC budget by 80%. Is this recklessness or deliberate action against preventive healthcare?" Richardson tweeted on Feb. 3. She has about 1,000 followers. PolitiFact found this tweet questionable. The CDC is the nation’s primary source for developing and applying disease prevention methods and health education activities. Cutting the CDC budget by 80 percent would have a drastic impact on its ability to study America’s ability to help prevent illness across the country. What the CDC said Finding the truth seemed as simple as asking CDC officials about their budget. So we reached out to them. Bernadette Burden, a senior press officer for the CDC, responded Wednesday. She said the CDC’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019, which starts in July, is $5.66 billion. That’s a decrease of approximately $1.4 billion – or 20 percent – compared to the spending level, Burden said in an email. A breakdown of spending in the current fiscal year is available on the CDC website. The CDC provided a fact sheet of Trump’s budget, which outlines where he aims to cut. Among other changes, Trump’s budget would cut $138 million from the program dedicated to chronic disease prevention and health promotion, cut $59.9 million from programs studying "emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases," and $46 million from a program called "Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health." A zoonotic disease is a disease that can be transmitted from animals to people. Burden noted that the CDC adapted its budget request to includes program reductions and eliminations that Trump proposed last year. Misreading headlines? PolitiFact couldn’t find any news articles that verified Richardson’s claim. It’s possible that Richardson misquoted the headline from this Washington Post story: "CDC to cut by 80 percent efforts to prevent global disease outbreak." The story says the CDC is downsizing one of its specific efforts – its epidemic prevention activities – because money is running out. The epidemic prevention programs "train front-line workers in outbreak detection and work to strengthen laboratory and emergency response systems in countries where disease risks are greatest," the Post reported. The CDC is cutting its efforts in 39 out of 49 countries. It’s unclear if Richardson misread the Washington Post headline. Nonetheless, PolitiFact believes this opportunity is as good as any to remind folks to read stories before making judgements about news based on headlines. As for Richardson, her assistant, Anna Meadows, confirmed that neither she nor Richardson could find the original source for the tweet. "She deleted the post after your inquiry, since she couldn’t find the source," Meadows said in an email. Our ruling Richardson tweeted that President Trump is "cutting the CDC budget by 80 percent." The proposal is a 20 percent cut – which is not remotely close to Richardson’s claim. She deleted the tweet. So we rate this claim False.

pomt-04036	Says the New Year’s Day "fiscal cliff" deal "reduces the deficit."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/31/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-deal-avert-fiscal-cliff-red/	Remember how Congress made its fiscal-cliff deal with votes on New Year’s Day? Democrats wanted to raise income taxes on high-earners but not cut future Medicare or Social Security benefits. Republicans didn’t want to raise income tax rates, but wanted to cut federal spending and tackle looming entitlement shortfalls. So on New Year’s Day, Congress voted on a compromise, raising taxes on people with incomes above $400,000, or $450,000 for couples. It also delayed more than $100 billion in scheduled spending cuts for two months. Logically, you’d think that without cutting spending or raising a whole lot more money through taxes, the nettlesome federal deficit would have only one direction to go: Up. That’s why Sen. Sherrod Brown’s statement on the day of the vote intrigued PolitiFact Ohio. Brown said: "While this deal isn’t perfect, it represents an important down payment in reducing the deficit and getting America’s fiscal house in order. It also prevents dangerous cuts to Social Security and reduces the deficit by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share." How could it cut the deficit? To understand, we turned to federal budgeting documents and outside group analyses. What we found could serve as a lesson in Washington’s unique logic, though it has its reasons. It’s like a riddle: Did the fiscal-cliff deal really reduce the deficit? That depends. This answer, maddeningly equivocal though it may be, is the one the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office gives in its analysis of the deal, officially called the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The CBO director’s blog said this on Jan. 4: "Does the Legislation Increase or Decrease Federal Budget Deficits? That depends on what you compare the legislation with." Explaining this requires on-the-one-hand and on-the-other, so let’s start with the first hand. Under laws sought and signed by President George W. Bush, Americans across a range of incomes saw their income taxes reduced, starting in 2001 and with more cuts in 2003. President Barack Obama extended the cuts in 2009. Those tax cuts had expiration dates written into law, however, namely, Dec, 31, 2012. If you believed the expiration date was inflexible, you’d think that everyone’s tax rates were going up on New Year’s Day. Yet if you paid attention to the talk in Washington, you knew better. You knew that Congress would probably pass bills so that middle-class families could keep their Bush-era tax rates, as Obama wanted, too. You knew that the alternative-minimum tax, using a formula that was about to sock many more families, would be fixed, either temporarily or permanently. Congress on Jan. 1, 2013, chose the latter. And you knew that neither Democrats nor Republicans wanted big cuts at the Pentagon, even though they previously passed the law that said such cuts would kick in. Sure, lawmakers in 2011 agreed to these eventual cuts when they couldn’t find a better compromise on that year’s budget crisis du jour. But they always vowed to try to find an alternative. Thus, the one hand -- and the other. Budgeters deal in numbers and must have a baseline from which to start. The law is a good place, providing a firm benchmark. So to return to Brown’s claim: If the law had remained in effect and most Americans experienced income tax hikes, the government would be due to collect a lot more tax revenue. And if the scheduled spending cuts, or sequestration, had begun as scheduled, slicing federal outlays by about $110 billion in 2013, the government would be saving a lot more money. But neither of these things happened because Congress on New Year’s Day changed the law with its American Taxpayer Relief Act. And what happens when you cut the amount of projected government revenue (by keeping many of the lower tax rates) and you spend more, not less? Based on current-law projections, your deficit is bound to rise. The CBO on Jan. 1 projected, in fact, a rise in the deficit by nearly $4 trillion over the next 10 years, a figure that many in the news media highlighted. The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, whose members include former Ohio U.S. Sen. George Voinovich, put the deficit rise at $4.6 trillion when adding some of the non-tax items such as the cost of extending unemployment benefits. So Brown was wrong, right? Not necessarily. Here is where reality kicks in, and the CBO recognizes reality. Besides projecting what would happen based on then-current law, the CBO also ran projections based on "current policy." Then-current policy was always to extend many of the tax cuts beyond their scheduled expiration. The only question was which tax cuts would be preserved. Democrats pushed for months to raise rates for families earning more than $250,000 a year, for example. For purposes of projections, the CBO assumed under an "alternative fiscal scenario" last August that all the Bush-era tax cuts would be extended. The fiscal-cliff deal turned out to be less generous than that, at least for families earning more than $450,000. Furthermore, the estate tax rate will rise from 35 to 40 percent (but will keep the $5.25 million exemption) under the New Year’s deal. Taxes on capital gains and dividends for families earning more than $450,000 will rise from 15 percent to 20 percent. There are additional changes, but you get the idea. All told, this group of tax hikes should bring in enough money -- if you compare it with what was expected to happen politically -- to actually cut deficit projections by $650 billion, says the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The CBO, in the director’s blog, said the deficit will be $700 billion to $800 billion less than projected under a continuation of anticipated policies. This is not the end of the budget debate, because the sequestration is now scheduled to start on March 1, although it is still deeply unpopular and Congress could change its date or size. How then, how does Brown’s claim rate for accuracy? Based on the CBO’s analysis, he was wrong -- if you use the baseline built on the old law and an assumption that every single tax cut would end and the sequester would kick in as scheduled. But Brown was right if you use the CBO’s alternative analysis. If you were gambling, you’d probably bet somewhere in the middle, which in a way is what Congress did. On the Truth-O-Meter, Brown’s claim rates Half True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2013-01-31T06:00:00	2013-01-01	['None']
pomt-01387	My office sends federal "money back every year."	true	/texas/statements/2014/oct/14/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-his-office-sends-back-budgeted-mo/	On the Sept. 7, 2014, edition of "Inside Texas Politics," a Dallas news program, WFAA-TV reporter Jason Whitely said to Sen. John Cornyn: "A recent survey caught our attention that showed you have one of the most expensive offices in the Senate -- in the top five, behind Feinstein, Boxer, Ted Cruz, I believe, and you’re in there, spending $3.7 million last year; the average is about $2.5 million. "Why is your office so expensive to run?" "Texas is a big state," Cornyn replied with a grin. "You’ll notice that... the ones with the largest budgets are the biggest states. And representing 26 million people... it costs money. So we try to conserve the money that we spend -- we send money back every year, try to live within those conservative means -- but the fact of the matter is, I’ve got a job to do and I’m going to do it the best I can and--" Whitely: "--you send money back every year?" Cornyn: "Yeah, we do." An Aug. 5, 2014, news story in The Washington Post, drawing on research by the Sunlight Foundation, said that between April 2013 and March 2014, the offices of U.S. senators from California, Texas, Florida and New York spent more than offices of other senators. The story said Cornyn’ s office, spending $3.7 million, ranked fifth behind California’s Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida; and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Cornyn's backup We were curious about Cornyn’s claim he doesn’t spend all the money budgeted for his office. To our inquiries, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie provided figures and pointed out a 2014 report by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service noting senators receive funding allowances covering official office expenses including staff, mail, travel to and from their state and Washington, D.C., equipment and other goods and services. And, according to the report, each senator gets some office funding based on their state’s population and distance from the capital. Each senator’s resulting expenditures are specified in a report issued every six months as well, which initially made us think it would be easy to gauge whether Cornyn has returned office funding every year since he joined the Senate in 2003. Commence gnashing. By email, Brandewie sent a chart showing what he described as the average amount of money unspent by Cornyn’s office each year: $308,488. He followed up with a chart showing what he described as the office’s unspent balances for each fiscal year, ranging from $19,824 as of the end of September 2005 up to $656,577 at the end of September 2010. Brandewie also pointed out his cited figures on pages of twice-a-year reports on Senate office spending. Source: Drew Brandewie, press secretary, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (received by email Oct. 9, 2014) Senate expenditure reports We initially failed to match the provided figures with entries in the six-month reports published by the Government Printing Office (which we paged through at the Texas State Library) partly, it turned out, because the reports list how much money an office didn’t spend in a line-item with a mysterious label. By email, Brandewie counseled that in all but one of the year-ending expense reports, summary line-items titled "Resc/Withdrawals" reflect authorized funds the senator’s office didn’t spend. ("Resc/Withdrawals," we suspect, is short for Rescissions/Withdrawals; a rescission, according to a Senate web page, is the cancellation of a budget authority previously provided by Congress. Got that? It will be on the final.) The report covering fiscal 2003, folding in about nine months of Cornyn’s first year in the Senate, shows a zero for his office’s entry. But, Brandewie said, that doesn’t mean Cornyn tapped out his office budget. Instead, in that year’s reports, unspent money was entered on a different line, labeled "Transfers," Brandewie said. Senate financial clerk Generally, Brandewie said, he based his answers about the expense reports on information provided by Chris Doby, the Senate’s financial clerk, who earlier told us by phone he couldn’t discuss Cornyn’s particular office expenditures. Doby also said it’s not uncommon for a Senate office to end a year with money unspent. Doby also said that if a Senate office doesn't spend all its authorized funds, the leftover money isn't immediately transferred to the U.S. Treasury; it's available for two years longer. Later, we asked Brandewie if the two-year lag basically enables a senator to both return funds and continue tapping those dollars. Brandewie, citing Doby, said leftover funds may only be spent on expenses from the year they were initially budgeted. So, he said, "a member cannot use funds from one year to pay for expenses from another. The funds are fixed, finite and do not roll over from year to year," the Cornyn aide emailed. Our ruling Cornyn said his office sends budgeted money back every year. We rate this claim True based on figures provided by Cornyn’s office that also appeared in public office expenditure reports, albeit connected to hard-to-decipher labels.

pomt-11481	Says Texas ranks among the nation’s top five states for its high school graduation rate.	true	/texas/statements/2018/mar/02/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-texas-ranks-among-5-top-states-it/	Gov. Greg Abbott told voters in advance of the March 2018 party primaries that Texas ranks very high nationally in its share of students graduating from high school. In a conference call with campaign supporters, Abbott said Feb. 19, 2018: "This is one of those facts that you are able to disarm liberals about. Listen, Texas has one of the top five states in the nation for high school graduation rate. More kids are graduating from high school, more kids are graduating from college than ever before." It shouldn’t surprise that in fast-growing Texas, more students graduate from high school and college than in years past. We focused on whether Texas still ranks among states with the highest high school graduation rates. By phone, Abbott spokesman John Wittman told us Abbott relied on a federal chart showing state-by-state high school graduation rates in 2015-16. According to the chart, posted by the National Center for Education Statistics, Iowa led the nation that year with a 91.3 percent high school graduation rate. The chart says New Jersey ran second, with a 90.1 percent rate, followed by West Virginia (89.8 percent) and Nebraska (89.3 percent). Texas landed fifth, the chart says, with a rate of 89.1 percent, just ahead of Missouri (89 percent). The nation’s high school graduation rate was 84.1 percent, the chart says. That fifth-place standing means Texas didn’t rank as highly as some other years. We asked the Texas Education Agency about the apparent slippage. By email, Lauren Callahan replied: "Yes, the rankings merely reflect relative performance and are accurate to the extent that the rates used for the rankings are accurate. However, we would like to also note that our graduation rate has consistently increased year over year for each graduating class." The statewide graduation rate in 2014-15 was 89 percent, the agency says, compared with 88.3 percent in 2013-14, 88 percent in 2012-13 and 84.3 percent in 2009-10. Another metric From past fact checks, we recognized another method is often used to gauge progress through high school — by comparing a year’s count of graduates to the number of ninth-graders three years earlier, with the difference indicating student attrition. Julian Vasquez Heilig, a professor at California State University Sacramento, has urged us to put stock in the attrition indicator because, he said, it shows the substantial drop-offs in student enrollment between ninth grade and the end of 12th grade. After Abbott spoke, we looked for a recent state-by-state breakdowns--getting a reminder that there are two ways to make this alternate comparison. In 2014-15, according to the NCES, 89 percent of Texas high-school students graduated three years after finishing ninth grade. According to the agency, Texas tied Alabama and Nebraska for third place nationally by this metric with Iowa (91 percent) and New Jersey (90 percent) leading the nation. Texas lags more states by a cruder yet popular measure based on tallying high school graduates each year and comparing that count to the number of students who completed ninth grade three years before. In 2012-13, the latest year analyzed by the NCES, Texas tied with California with an "averaged freshman graduation rate" of 83.6 percent. Twenty states had higher rates, a center chart says, with Nebraska No. 1 (93.3 percent rate) followed by Wisconsin (93 percent), North Dakota (91.4 percent), Minnesota (91 percent) and Iowa (89.4 percent). For this fact-check, Heilig guided us to David Hinojosa of the San Antonio-based Intercultural Development Research Association, which has tracked high school completion rates for decades. By email, Hinojosa pointed out the group’s October 2017 report stating that through the 2016-17 school year, the state’s attrition rate, not counting charter schools, hovered around 24 percent to 25 percent for five years--down from 33 percent in the mid-1980s. "Texas public schools are failing to graduate one out of every four" high school "students," the report says. To our inquiry, state education officials didn’t have a comparable attrition rate for 2016-17. DeEtta Culbertson, a TEA spokeswoman, emailed us agency information indicating that for 2015-16, the state calculated an attrition rate of 19.6 percent. Culbertson had no comment on the IDRA analysis. Our ruling Abbott said Texas ranks among "the top five states in the nation for" its "high school graduation rate." Texas ranked No. 5 nationally for its 2015-16 graduation rate. Abbott was not talking about an alternate metric by which Texas in 2012-13 trailed 20 states for its share of students graduating compared to the number of ninth-grade students three years before.

pomt-14214	"We spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/19/bernie-sanders/sanders-oversimplifies-us-share-NATO/	In most respects, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are light years apart, but on some policy points, they seem to be on the same page. One area of common ground is U.S. funding for NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Trump has raised the specter of America pulling out of the military alliance if the Europeans don’t pick up a bigger share. At the Democratic debate in Brooklyn, N.Y. on April 14, 2016, Sanders didn’t go quite that far, but he certainly talked about the problem in similar terms. A panelist quoted Sanders’ own words on NATO from 1997. Back then he said, "It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe." Asked if he still felt that way during the debate, Sanders said, "We spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO. Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense." Does the United States pay as large a share of NATO military spending as Sanders said? When we originally heard this item, we thought Sanders had it right. We originally published this fact-check moments after the April 14 debate as True. But very quickly, we discovered that Sanders didn’t describe the 75 percent statistic entirely accurately. We removed that fact-check from our database and are taking a fresh look here. Warren Gunnels, policy director for the Sanders campaign, referred us to a Wall Street Journal article about how few NATO members meet the alliance’s defense spending targets. On paper, members say they will put at least 2 percent of their GDP into their militaries. In practice, only five do: the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece, Estonia and Poland. "Sen. Sanders made the point that our NATO allies should pick up more of the burden for their defense, citing the fact that the United States spends about 75 percent of NATO's total military expenditures," Gunnels said. We went to the latest NATO budget report. By NATO’s count, total defense spending of all NATO members stood at about $900 billion in 2015 in current dollars. The United States’ share was about $650 billion. Do the math, and the percentage comes to about 72 percent. Here are the top four top countries on NATO’s list: Country Spending (millions) Percent of total United States $649,931 72.2% United Kingdom $59,699 6.6% France $43,864 4.9% Germany $39,743 4.4% NATO total $900,473 But we need to understand what these numbers show. They don’t represent dollars or euros spent on behalf of NATO, or as Sanders said, "the military aspect of NATO." These figures are the total defense budgets of the NATO members -- including spending on projects far from NATO’s purview. Gordon Adams, professor emeritus at American University’s School of International Service, told us this is the standard approach to the question of which country brings the most to the NATO party. "The comparison folks look at is overall defense spending, and by the NATO definition, the United States covers more than 70 percent of the total for all NATO members," Adams said. Adams argues that the United States pays for a global operation, part of which includes Europe. The European members mainly pay for European-based forces for use in Europe. America’s equipment and personnel, Adams notes, can be used anywhere. "Were there a war in Europe, U.S. defense capabilities elsewhere in the world would be swung to Europe," he said. So even if America has sent ships to the South China Sea to discourage China’s activities there, and is bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria, all that and more weighs in the balance of NATO’s resources. That is one view. Laicie Heeley, a military budget expert at the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank, sees things otherwise. "Sanders' claim is a commonly quoted misperception, or misleading quote, however you choose to see it," Heeley said. "The stat says nothing about the U.S. relationship to NATO. It simply states that the United States is the world's greatest military spender." Lisa Samp, a fellow with the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, also describes Sanders’ words as a "common misunderstanding." "There is a difference between what nations contribute to NATO and what they spend on their own defense," Samp said. "More accurate would be to say the United States contributes 22 percent of NATO’s common funding." NATO’s common expenses NATO does have things it calls its own. There is a civilian staff and headquarters, and military equipment such as surveillance aircraft. There are bases, command headquarters and a program to beef up military capabilities in certain countries above and beyond what they would need for their own defense. For 2016, NATO’s total military budget is about $2 billion. (Since Sanders specified the military aspect, we’ll ignore the civilian costs, which are about $200 million.) Each member contributes an agreed upon percentage of the shared budget. The United States leads the pack, paying 22 percent, as Samp said. This year, that comes to about $460 million. (Germany comes in second, paying about 15 percent.) That is a far cry from 75 percent of NATO’s military expense. But while the common expenses allow us to be more precise about the money American taxpayers put into NATO, these numbers don’t capture either the full picture of the U.S. presence in Europe, or NATO’s true military capacity. "You could not fight a war with the $2 billion," Adams said. "I have to say defining (the NATO budget) that way is, to me, both irrelevant and meaningless." Interwoven goals, interwoven dollars The one point that experts seem to agree on is that there is no easy way to separate America’s military spending in Europe from its global military strategy. The United States has responded to Russia’s military moves in Ukraine with a program to boost the U.S. presence in central and eastern Europe. With a 2016 price tag just shy of $800 million, the Pentagon has put more boots on the ground, prepositioned equipment and supplies and in many other ways laid the groundwork to respond faster to any new moves Russia might make. Samp told us while this clearly helps defend Europe, it has greater implications. "It’s not just for Europe but to forward deploy and have global reach," she said. "We can’t say everything we’re doing in Europe is just for Europe. It’s for our benefit and our overall strategy as well." In the same way that American forces around the world could be called in to help Europe, so too are American forces in Europe available to support U.S. operations elsewhere, for example in fighting ISIS in the Middle East. "There is no easy way to sort out what the United States spends by region because both equipment and personnel are usable in every region of the world," Adams said. Our ruling Sanders said that the United States spends "about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO." The problem with that statement is that NATO’s military resources defy easy description. There are two ways to quantify them and both are incomplete. The alliance sums up the total defense budgets of its members and counts that as its resources. By that measure, the United States represents about 72 percent of NATO. But that hardly captures America’s role because its defense budget is shaped by factors outside of Europe. On the other hand, NATO has common military expenses on the order of $2 billion a year. The U.S. share of that is about 22 percent. But those dollars exclude the vast spending it takes to sustain American forces, equipment and bases across Europe. And in a final twist, even those expenditures aren’t solely for the benefit of Europe.

pomt-11112	"One legislative Republican’s district gets almost all the school supply funding."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/jun/07/roy-cooper/school-supply-funding-cooper-leaves-out-important-/	Gov. Roy Cooper has repeatedly said the state isn’t doing enough to provide teachers with the supplies they need. Classroom equipment and supply funding has fallen by tens of millions of dollars over the past decade and, in response, Cooper has pushed legislative leaders for more funding and even held his own school supply drive. Republicans hold a supermajority in the North Carolina legislature and recently passed their budget plan mostly without the help of Democrats. Since then, Democrats have criticized Republicans for what they see as "pork" in the budget. Cooper made one such attack on May 30, when he tweeted a graphic that reads: "One legislative Republican’s district gets almost all the school supply funding." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Base vs. new funding Sadie Weiner, Cooper’s communications director, highlighted in an email a key distinction that’s not included in the tweet: It’s referring to new, additional funding — not the base budget for all school districts in the state. "That tweet is talking about new school supply funding in the 2018-19 budget. Republicans will argue that their budget has $47 million for school supplies and instructional equipment. That is routine funding in the base budget, it is not new funding, and the Governor’s recommended budget includes the same $47 million," she wrote. "The Governor included $15 million in new funding that would go directly to teachers in the form of a school supply stipend," Weiner continued. "That money would go to all state-funded teachers, not just those in a single district as the Republican budget has done." She referred to Senate District 41, represented by Cornelius Republican Jeff Tarte, who faces a competitive re-election race in November. The budget includes $200,000 for DonorsChoose.org, a New York-based nonprofit. The bill instructed the group to use the money on supplies for teachers in certain schools within Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools — all within Tarte’s district. Donors Choose declined the money, saying the grant didn’t provide "equitable" funding across the state. The Charlotte Observer posted a story about the group’s decision less than an hour after Cooper posted the tweet. While Cooper's tweet doesn't differentiate between base and new school supply funding, Weiner noted that Cooper was more specific in his press conference on Wednesday. The budget, he said, "falls short on textbooks and digital learning, offers new schools supply money only to a few in-tech schools." Other supply funding Jonathan Sink, an aide to House Speaker Tim Moore, said in an email that the budget provides five new grants for classroom supplies, materials and equipment. In addition to DonorsChoose, the following groups get money: · Franklin County Education Foundation: $60,000 to support grants for supplies to teachers in Franklin County Schools · Town of Holly Springs: $50,000 to support four programs, one of which is the Teacher Classroom Supply Program · Cary Chamber of Commerce: $25,000 to support a Cary Teacher Classroom Supply Program · Robeson County Career Center: $7,500 for purchase of classroom equipment at the Robeson County Career Center in the Public Schools of Robeson County. Our ruling Cooper tweeted: "One legislative Republican’s district gets almost all the school supply funding." Cooper has a point that budget writers designated a large portion of new school supply funding to schools in one Republican legislator’s district. But his tweet lacks important context, giving the impression that school districts might go without new school supplies this year — which isn’t true. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05830	"Fewer than 10 percent of those in the House are what anyone would classify as wealthy."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/feb/17/john-duncan/congressman-duncan-says-fewer-10-percent-us-house-/	The wealth of Congress members has long been a sore point with many voters, who rightly or wrongly, often equate power with monetary riches. The question of who is wealthy – and who isn’t – again became part of the collective discourse with the rise of the Occupy Wall Street movement and its rallying cries against the wealthiest "1 percent." U.S. Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Knoxville, challenged the notion that Congress is filled with rich fat cats in a Washington Report newsletter to constituents in December 2011. The six-page report, which included the congressman’s update on various legislative matters, was prepared, published and mailed at taxpayer expense. "It may be hard for some to believe," Duncan wrote, "but fewer than 10 percent of those in the House are what anyone would classify as wealthy." Mark Harmon, a University of Tennessee journalism professor and a former member of the Knox County Commission, challenged the congressman’s claim as erroneous and "out of touch" in a guest column published in the Knoxville News Sentinel on Jan. 15, 2012. The claim sounded suspicious to us, too, so we contacted the congressman’s office and asked how he had reached that conclusion. Duncan’s press spokesman, Patrick Newton, provided us with a statement that the congressman himself had written in response to Harmon’s column. Duncan, who represents the 2nd Congressional District in East Tennessee, wrote that his comments were based "in part on personal conversations with many members (of Congress), but primarily on an annual report of the 50 wealthiest members of Congress by Roll Call, a very non-partisan Capitol Hill newspaper." "Although there are some members of Congress who are multi-millionaires, money mostly made before they came to Congress, the great, great majority are not, including me," said Duncan, who has been in the House for 24 years and served as a state trial judge before he was elected to Congress. Getting a true reading of a Congress member’s wealth can be difficult, but there are organizations that attempt to ascertain the net worth of elected leaders. Members of the U.S. House and Senate are paid $174,000 annually; lawmakers who hold leadership positions are paid slightly more. But many members of Congress were wealthy before they arrived in Washington and have substantial net worth. Members are required to file annual financial statements, but they are allowed to report the value of their assets in broad ranges. For example, if someone owns $1,100 worth of stock in a company, the exact value of that stock is not reported. Instead, its value is listed in the range of $1,001 to $15,000. Lawmakers are not required to list the value of their primary residence. The purpose of such a reporting system is to provide lawmakers with some financial privacy, while allowing some level of public scrutiny of their income. But Duncan and other lawmakers argue the broad reporting ranges often make lawmakers look much wealthier than they actually are. Roll Call, a nonpartisan newspaper that focuses on Capitol Hill, analyzes the data and compiles an annual list of the 50 wealthiest members of Congress. The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks money’s influence on politics, also uses the data to estimate the wealth of all 435 House members and 100 senators. Even though the two organizations analyze the same data, each uses a different methodology that sometimes causes them to reach different conclusions. Roll Call calculates a Congress member’s minimum net worth by adding the minimum value of all their assets and subtracting the total minimum value of all their liabilities. The Center for Responsive Politics calculates a member’s net wealth by adding together his or her range of assets and then subtracting his or her range of liabilities. The center then calculates the midpoint of the resulting range and lists that figure as the lawmaker’s net wealth. We’ll look first at Roll Call’s list of the 50 wealthiest members of Congress, since Duncan said that is the primary basis for his claim that fewer than 10 percent of House members are wealthy. In its most recent rankings, published Aug. 18, 2011, Roll Call concluded that the net worth of the 50 wealthiest Congress members ranged from a high of $294.21 million (Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas) to a low of $6.21 million (Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas). Twenty-nine of the lawmakers on the 50 wealthiest list were House members and 21 were senators. If one uses this list as a benchmark for deciding which lawmakers are wealthy, as Duncan apparently did, then just 6 percent of the 435 House members would be considered wealthy. But is that really a fair measure of wealth? Is $6.21 million – the estimated net worth of the least affluent member on the 50 wealthiest list – really the cut-off point at which most Americans would consider someone to be wealthy? Given that the median net wealth for the country at large was $96,000 in 2009, according to the Federal Reserve, we wondered how an economist would define wealthy. We put that question to Scott Winship, a fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, and Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Both institutes are left-leaning think tanks in Washington. Winship pointed out that Federal Reserve data shows the top 10 percent of wealthiest Americans in 2007 had a net worth of at least $971,000. That equates to roughly $1 million in 2010 dollars, "so if you want to look at the entry point to the top 10 percent of wealth as your definition of ‘wealthy,’ you can use $1 million as an easy cut-off," Winship said. Bivens, however, suggested a better measure might be the top 5 percent of wealthiest Americans, who had a net wealth of at least $1.8 million in 2007. When we apply the $1 million benchmark suggested by Winship, it's clear that members are Congress are much wealthier than average Americans. The Center for Responsive Politics says its analysis of financial disclosure statements, released on Nov. 15, 2011, shows that 250 current members of the House and Senate are millionaires. In the House, 183 members -- or 42 percent -- had an average net worth in excess of $1 million in 2010. Applying the $1.8 million benchmark suggested by Bivens, the numbers drop, but not by much -- 137 House members, or 31 percent, had an average net worth of at least $1.8 million. For the record, Duncan says the Center for Responsive Politics’ latest rankings came out after he had finished his newsletter. But he reiterated his belief that using both minimum and maximum figures makes Congress members appear far wealthier than they really are. We concede that the center’s use of an average range could skew numbers, but 435 is a large enough sample size to conclude that aberrations would balance out -- where one member’s net worth could be exaggerated, another’s could be understated. Duncan’s net worth, by the way, ranged from $169,022 at the low end, $660,000 on the high end and the mid-range estimate hitting $414,511. And, again, the numbers do not include the value of a member’s primary residence. Our ruling While it is difficult to get an exact measure of congressional riches, House and Senate members are clearly much better off financially than the average American. Roughly one-third of House members, or 31 percent, have an average net worth not including their primary residence of at least $1.8 million, putting them among the 5 percent of wealthiest Americans. Even more, 42 percent, have a net worth in excess of $1 million. Under either measure, Duncan’s claim that fewer than 10 percent of House members are wealthy is way off base. We rate this claim False.	None	John Duncan	None	None	None	2012-02-17T11:14:53	2011-12-01	['None']
pomt-09694	"President Obama campaigned on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/10/planned-parenthood/planned-parenthood-says-obama-promised-put-reprodu/	With abortion now a key issue in the debate over health care reform, abortion rights supporters are highlighting President Barack Obama's promise about the issue during the presidential campaign. In an alert to members on Nov. 9, 2009, Planned Parenthood Action Fund said, "President Obama campaigned on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan." We'll address that claim here. We'll also be adding it to our Obameter database of campaign promises. The group's claim is virtually identical to one made in September by House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, who said in a statement that, "during his quest for the presidency, now-President Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president." We researched Boehner's claim and concluded he was right about Obama's promise. We rated the statement True . To explore Obama's promise on abortion coverage in his health care plan, you need to go back to a July 17, 2007, speech he gave to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. In that speech, he discussed his commitment to how "reproductive care" -- a term a campaign aide said included abortion coverage -- would fit into his health care reform plan. Obama said, "In my mind, reproductive care is essential care. It is basic care, so it is at the center and at the heart of the plan that I propose. Essentially what we're doing is, we’re going to set up a public plan that all persons and all women can access if they don’t have health insurance. It will be a plan that will provide all essential services, including reproductive services, as well as mental health services and disease management services, because part of our interest is to make sure that we’re putting more money into preventive care." The words Obama used in that speech mirror those in the Planned Parenthood Action Fund's recent alert even more closely than they did Boehner's formulation. So it's certainly correct, as the group says, that Obama "campaigned on a promise to put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan." It's worth nothing that since he spoke to that group -- an important constituency for someone seeking the Democratic nomination -- he has chosen his words carefully. Of all the words Obama has spoken and written about health care reform since 2007 -- a voluminous amount, to be sure -- the terms "abortion" and "reproductive health" haven't popped up very often. Indeed, on several of the rare occasions in which Obama or his staff have broached the subject, it's been to assure Americans that his health care proposal would not promote abortions. For instance, in his prime-time address to Congress on Sept. 9, 2009, Obama's only mention of abortion -- which came immediately after he was interrupted by the heckling Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C. -- was that "one more misunderstanding I want to clear up: Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place." That's a reflection of the sensitivity surrounding the issue. Obama's promise to the abortion rights group during the primary campaign could now be a liability before a broader audience that includes many people opposed to abortion rights. Still, Planned Parenthood is correct that Obama campaigned on a promise that he would put reproductive health care at the center of his reform plan." After all, he was speaking to . . . Planned Parenthood. So we find the group's claim to be True.	None	Planned Parenthood	None	None	None	2009-11-10T18:02:10	2009-11-09	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-03267	"There is no planned air-conditioned restaurant out on the Lens."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/aug/08/kathleen-ford/kathleen-ford-says-lens-design-new-pier-does-not-i/	Opponents of the Lens design for St. Petersburg’s Pier knock it as a "sidewalk to nowhere," a function-less structure lacking important amenities of the retired inverted pyramid. Take, for instance, the ability to eat food above water in cool air. "Folks, there is no air-conditioned restaurant at the Lens," mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford declared at the Aug. 6 Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 mayoral forum. "Let me just clear that up for you. There’s been a lot of questions about that issue. There is no planned air-conditioned restaurant out on the Lens." Ford’s claim came in response to a question about whether residents should get to vote on a replacement design for the Pier if they decide to cancel the current project in the Aug. 27 primary election. Stop the Lens has argued against the Lens for a host of reasons, including the lack of a restaurant. The inverted pyramid Pier, which closed May 31 but has not been demolished, had a few restaurants, including the Columbia Restaurant. The new plan for the Pier, with its looping, futuristic, open-air design, does not allocate nearly the same amount of space for restaurants as before. Instead of a full-size restaurant topping the water, Lens designers opted for a new restaurant strategy, in part to cut the taxpayer subsidy for the Pier. They planned a small, open-air cafe run by the Columbia restaurant on the Lens structure’s "promontory," which overlooks the water. Meanwhile, a new Columbia restaurant would anchor a waterfront location at the approach to the Pier known as the Hub, which is currently the Pelican parking lot. Columbia owners say it will have about 8,000 square feet of air-conditioned space as well as outdoor and rooftop seating. Richard Gonzmart, a member of the family that owns the Columbia Restaurant Group, said the cafe would be different from traditional fare at the Columbia, featuring a fusion of Japanese and Peruvian seafood and an open bar. Would it have air conditioning? It’s hard to say, because final planning stages have not yet begun. Enclosing the cafe space would take away from the intended experience, he said, adding he sees himself enjoying a glass of sauvignon blanc at the water’s edge in casual Florida wear with his German shepherd Rusty. Vivid personal preference aside, he acknowledges it may not be ideal for heat-weary visitors. His company is testing out a fan misting system at its cafe location at the Tampa Bay History Center in Tampa, he said. Still, the looming referendum makes brainstorming ideas for either location with the California-based architects very difficult, he said. Much is left to be determined, and the City Council has not yet approved a lease with his restaurant for either space. "We’ll have to come up with a way to cool it down," Gonzmart said. "I will investigate what we can do to make it comfortable." City architect Raul Quintana said the nitty-gritty of the design will only be worked out between Columbia ownership and architects if the project survives the public vote. "There’s no ‘yes or no’ answer," Quintana said. "Could (the cafe) be air-conditioned? Absolutely, if that’s what Gonzmart wants." Two more parts of the promontory, a small ice cream parlor and bathroom facilities, will be air-conditioned, said Lisa Wannemacher, the associate local architect for the project. Lens opponents, including president of Concerned Citizens of St. Petersburg William Ballard, have criticized the design for not including 26,000 square feet for a restaurant, one of the recommendations of the 2010 Pier Advisory Task Force report. "We feel very comfortable stating that there is no air-conditioned restaurant out on the over water portion of the Lens," Ballard said, "nor is there an air-conditioned space just for people to go out there, even an enclosed space that they could retreat to get away from the weather." There was not enough money to meet all of the task force’s recommendations, Wannemacher said, and building the restaurant on land helps reduce the project's costs. Two leaders of the task force defended the plan for the upland restaurant and promontory cafe, saying while it’s not exactly what the group had in mind, "it does substantially address the task force’s identification of a restaurant-based program as a focus." Our ruling Ford said, "There is no planned air-conditioned restaurant out on the Lens." Ford's specific wording is technically accurate, but it ignores the fact that there are two places to get food that are part of the Lens project. The latest designs from the architect envision an open-air cafe at the endpoint of the Lens. The cafe's final design awaits collaboration between Columbia ownership and architects, and those talks are stalled with the big vote on the Lens on Aug. 27. Further, the Columbia will open a separate air-conditioned restaurant that's on the approach to the Lens and has a waterfront view. Her statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. We rate this Mostly True.	None	Kathleen Ford	None	None	None	2013-08-08T13:33:53	2013-08-06	['None']
pomt-06102	"Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/04/declan-oscanlon/new-jersey-residents-earning-1-million-face-effect/	Earning $1 million in New Jersey can buy many things, but it also means you’ll be sending a larger share of your income to Trenton. As state legislators remain divided over reinstituting a so-called "millionaires tax," state Assemblyman Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) argued in an opinion piece last month that millionaires are already paying a larger share of their earnings toward state income taxes than people earning $100,000. "Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay," O’Scanlon wrote in the Dec. 16 piece published in The Star-Ledger. "When and how will we know when we’ve achieved ‘fairness’?" Millionaires are paying an "effective tax rate" four times more than those earning $100,000? That’s right, PolitiFact New Jersey found. According to the New Jersey Department of the Treasury, taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective income tax rate of 6.88 percent, compared with 1.73 percent for people earning $100,000. O’Scanlon told us his point was that those earning $1 million already pay their fair share. An increase in income taxes could drive people out of the state or discourage them from moving to New Jersey, O’Scanlon said. "It’s wonderful politics," O’Scanlon said. "It’s lousy policy." First, let’s explain what an "effective tax rate" is. New Jersey currently imposes state income tax rates ranging from 1.4 percent on income of $20,000 or less to a top rate of 8.97 percent on income of $500,001 or greater. But those rates don’t represent what individuals actually pay in total income taxes, because a person’s income faces different rates as his income increases. Also, taxpayers can receive various exemptions and deductions. So, the "effective tax rate" represents the percentage of one’s gross income that actually goes toward income taxes. Andrew Pratt, a Treasury Department spokesman, told us the department calculated effective tax rates for O’Scanlon, per the following income levels: $100,000: 1.73 percent $1 million: 6.88 percent $5 million: 8.5 percent $10 million: 8.72 percent Based on those numbers, someone earning $1 million is paying $68,800 in state income taxes, compared to $1,730 for taxpayers earning $100,000. For individuals with smaller incomes, the effective tax rate is even less. Taxpayers earning between $20,001 and $50,000 pay an effective tax rate of 0.7 percent, according to the state Treasury department. Pratt also noted how higher-income earners represent a small percentage of taxpayers, but provide a significant portion of the tax revenue. "Notice that income over $500,000 represents an infinitesimal 0.2 percent of taxpayers, yet brings in 34.1 percent of tax revenue," Pratt said in an email. "Throw in the rest of the top 1 percent of taxpayers, and you get 37 percent of total tax collections." Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us an effective tax rate is the "appropriate measure to assess tax burden." "That's the share of income going to taxes. A person's effective tax rate equals her tax liability divided by her pretax income," Williams said in an email. "Thus a person making $100,000 and paying a total of $15,000 in tax(es) faces an effective tax rate of 15%." Our ruling In an opinion piece in the Star-Ledger, O’Scanlon wrote: "Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay." Based on data from the state Treasury department, O’Scanlon is correct. Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate of 6.88 percent, which is about four times the 1.73 percent paid by individuals earning $100,000. We rate the statement True.

pomt-02612	"Forty years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/24/louie-gohmert/texas-rep-louie-gohmert-says-40-years-ago-hardly-a/	Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, went on Fox News recently to explain an unusual decision he’d made: intentionally going without health insurance. Fox host Brian Kilmeade asked Gohmert about it during an interview on Jan. 23, 2014. Gohmert told him, "When Obamacare actually kicked in, just as we knew, if you liked your insurance, as I did -- I had a health savings account -- then I wasn't going to be able to keep it because it doesn't meet the requirements." Gohmert continued, "I don't have an extra $1,200 a month. And we are setting money aside in the event we need it. But Brian, don't forget, you know, 40 years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance, and this is one of the areas we really need reform in." Going without insurance is Gohmert’s decision to make. Presumably, he would be subject to the penalty under Obamacare for not having insurance. That would be $95 per adult or 1 percent of family income, whichever is higher, for 2014, and $325 per adult or 2 percent of family income for 2015, whichever is higher. The penalty goes even higher starting in 2016. For this fact-check, however, we wondered whether Gohmert was right that "40 years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance." Gohmert’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry, but right off the bat, we knew there was a problem with this claim. Forty years ago was 1974 -- almost a decade after the creation of Medicare (the universal health care program for Americans age 65 and up) and Medicaid (the health care program for qualifying low-income Americans). By 1975, Medicare was covering almost 25 million Americans, and Medicaid was covering about 20 million Americans. Even accounting for some overlap between the two programs’ beneficiaries, that’s a lot of Americans who had insurance 40 years ago. The U.S. population at the time was about 214 million, so roughly one of every five or six Americans was covered by these two programs alone. But maybe Gohmert was talking only about private insurance. So we located data on that, too. A 2009 paper published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that in 1974, nearly 149 million Americans had private insurance, mostly from their employers but in some cases purchased individually. That works out to four out of every five Americans under age 65 with private insurance coverage in 1974 -- a far cry from "hardly anybody." Gohmert’s claim "might have been closer to being true in the 1930s or ‘40s, but it does not characterize the United States 40 years ago," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. (Here’s an earlier story we published about how health coverage operated prior to Medicare and Medicaid. It’s fair to say that health coverage was a whole lot spottier in the early part of the 20th century.) Michael Tanner, a health-policy specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute, suggested that 40 years ago, insurance may have been more likely to cover big-ticket items such as hospital care and less likely to cover smaller, more routine medical procedures. Tanner appears to have a point. According to 1974 data published by the Social Security Administration, 75 percent to 80 percent of Americans with private insurance were covered for hospital stays, surgery and X-rays, but only about 60 percent were covered for "office and home visits," and about 70 percent were covered for prescription drugs outside of the hospital setting. Still, not even these figures help Gohmert’s case, since even the lower percentages for non-hospital care aren’t anywhere near the trivial numbers of insured Americans Gohmert claimed. Gohmert’s statement is "just flat wrong," Wilensky said. Our ruling Gohmert said that "40 years ago, hardly anybody in the country had health insurance." Even ignoring the millions of Americans covered in 1974 by Medicare and Medicaid, 80 percent of Americans under age 65 back then had private insurance coverage, and a solid majority of those plans covered routine doctor visits and prescription drugs in addition to hospital care. These numbers are so far off from Gohmert’s claim that we rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Louie Gohmert	None	None	None	2014-01-24T12:15:41	2014-01-23	['None']
pomt-09414	The Congressional Budget Office analysis of the health insurance reform legislation says the bill "cuts the deficit by $1.2 trillion in the second 10 years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/18/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-cbo-says-health-reform-bill-would-cut-defic/	Shortly after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its highly anticipated analysis of the economic impact of the health insurance reform legislation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a press release listing several "key points you need to know about the CBO score." No. 1 on that list is, "Based on a preliminary analysis from CBO, the legislation ... cuts the deficit." More specifically, the release says the CBO report shows that the legislation cuts the deficit by $138 billion in the first ten years (2010-2019) and "cuts the deficit by $1.2 trillion in the second 10 years." There's no debate about the first 10 years: The CBO analysis clearly states that the health care bill passed by the Senate, together with the reconciliation proposal, "would produce a net reduction in federal deficits of $138 billion over the 2010-2019 period as result of changes in direct spending and revenue." The projection for the next decade is murkier. We've dealt with this issue of the second decade before, most recently when President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address that the Senate bill would "bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades." But these are new numbers from the CBO, taking into account the reconciliation bill, and since the deficit reduction in the second decade has clearly become a major talking point for Democratic leaders, we thought the issue was worth revisiting. First, the preliminary estimate released by the CBO on March 18, 2010, does not say the legislation will cut the deficit by $1.2 trillion in the second 10 years. Rather, it projects that in the second 10 years, the legislation would reduce deficits "in a broad range around one-half percent of GDP." In order to arrive at the $1.2 trillion figure, Pelosi -- and other Democratic leaders who have cited it -- had to extrapolate that number based on a forecast of where the gross domestic product will be 10 to 20 years from now (which the CBO doesn't do). Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, thinks Pelosi's estimate is actually a little conservative. Horney looked at the last year for which CBO projects the GDP, 2020. That year, CBO estimated GDP at just over $22.5 trillion, up 4 percent from the year before. If you project that GDP will continue to rise an average of 4 percent a year for each of the next 10 years after that, then the CBO's projection that the deficit will be reduced by half a percent of GDP translates to $1.4 trillion between 2010 and 2020. "So I don't think $1.2 trillion is an overstatement," Horney said. When you talk to the public, it doesn't do any good to talk in terms of percentages of GDP, he said. You've got to translate that into dollars. "It's perfectly reasonable to put that into terms people can understand," Horney said. But putting dollar figures on economic forecasts 10 to 20 years into the future is highly speculative stuff. In a letter accompanying the CBO's preliminary analysis, director Douglas W. Elmendorf noted that "CBO does not generally provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period," but they made an exception because "certain congressional rules require some information about the budgetary impact of legislation in subsequent decades," and because a number of legislators asked them to. In addition to presenting deficit cuts from the legislation as a percentage of GDP, rather than as a dollar figure, Elmendorf couched the figure with cautionary words, calling it a "rough outlook" with an "even greater degree of uncertainty" than the 10-year budget estimates. When it analyzed the Senate bill, the CBO said this: "A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great. Among other factors, a wide range of changes could occur — in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care (such as advances in medical research, technological developments, and changes in physicians’ practice patterns) — that are likely to be significant but are very difficult to predict, both under current law and under any proposal." Elmendorf said the projection is also based on "assuming that all of its provisions would continue to be fully implemented." That's a big assumption. On Dec. 10, 2009, the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a report that concluded, for example, that the plan to reduce payment updates to health care providers through Medicare "are unlikely to be sustainable on an annual basis" and that further reductions in Medicare growth rates through the Independent Medicare Advisory Board "may be difficult to achieve in practice." Robert Book, a health economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Pelosi's deficit reduction number -- extrapolated from a forecast of the GDP -- is highly speculative. "GDP estimates are extremely uncertain," Book said. "Ten years ago, who would have predicted we'd have a recession last year? Nobody could possibly have known that." And besides, he said, if the plan reduces deficits "it just means it raises taxes a lot." "So the number is probably not right, and even if it were, it's meaningless," Book said. Bottom line, the CBO report says the health care bill -- with the proposed reconciliation -- would continue to improve the deficit situation in the second 10 years. But Pelosi's press release suggests the CBO came up with that $1.2 trillion number. It did not. In fact, the CBO has said a year-by-year projection of the bill's budget effect beyond the first 10 years would "not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great." It's natural to want to translate the CBO's GDP projection into actual dollars (Who can get their head around a half a percent of GDP 10 to 20 years from now?). And the GDP projections used to extrapolate the $1.2 trillion figure may be perfectly reasonable, if highly speculative. But Pelosi puts a firm number on a projection that CBO so carefully tried to hedge. And so we rate this claim Half True.	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2010-03-18T17:43:44	2010-03-18	['None']
pomt-12645	"We offer a tremendous amount of low calorie, no calorie options, like waters, unsweetened products, low calorie diet items. All of which unfortunately are taxed by this tax."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/24/ax-bev-tax/pepsi-execs-words-twisted-anti-philly-soda-tax-gro/	At times, it hasn’t been 100 percent clear to vendors and shoppers what’s covered under Philadelphia’s sugary drinks tax. Look no further than that time ShopRite taxed hot sauce in January. But a high-ranking PepsiCo employee should probably understand, right? Well that’s not what it sounded like in a tweet earlier this week from the anti-tax coalition Ax The Bev Tax. The tweet replayed a conversation on WURD 900-AM between host Solomon Jones and Amy Chen, founder of PepsiCo’s Food for Good initiative. In the short clip, as presented in the tweet, Chen says, "We offer a tremendous amount of low calorie, no calorie options, like waters, unsweetened products, low calorie diet items. All of which unfortunately are taxed by this tax." Unsweetened products and water, taxed? Um, what happened? First of all, unsweetened beverages and water are not taxed. According to the Mayor’s Office, the soda tax covers all non-alcoholic beverages with any amount of natural or artificial sweetener. Any unsweetened beverage and regular water would not be taxed. And even in the realm of sweetened beverages there are some exceptions. Drinks that are at least 50 percent milk, baby formula, 100 percent juice, at least 50 percent "fresh" fruit or vegetable are not taxed. Chen’s conversation with Jones lasted for several minutes, based on the audio file from WURD’s website. So Ax The Bev Tax edited it down for purposes of the tweet. And not only did they shorten Chen’s conversation, the alteration of the clip adjusted what she said. In her original conversation with Jones, Chen said, "We offer a tremendous amount of low calorie, no calorie options, like waters, unsweetened products, low calorie diet items. All of which unfortunately -- or most of which -- are taxed by this tax." Ax the Bev Tax’s clip removed "or most of which," the portion of her statement where she realized her error of saying all those drinks would be taxed and corrected herself. Speaking for PepsiCo and Ax The Bev Tax, Anthony Campisi said it was an editing error committed by someone "still getting oriented with the nuances of the tax" and that the anti-soda tax coalition had consistently claimed from the beginning the tax only applies to sweetened beverages. He called it an honest mistake and said, "this just seems like in the grand scheme of things about the beverage tax to be really small stuff." Our ruling The Ax The Bev Tax Twitter account played a clip of Pepsi employee Amy Chen saying "We offer a tremendous amount of low calorie, no calorie options, like waters, unsweetened products, low calorie diet items. All of which unfortunately are taxed by this tax." Water, as long as it has no sweeteners added, and unsweetened beverages are not taxed. Chen actually said on the radio show that "most" of those types of beverages were taxed, but Ax The Bev Tax’s clip was altered. Ax The Bev Tax has acknowledged the clip is inaccurate, with spokesperson Anthony Campisi chalking it up to an editing error by someone still getting familiar with the nuances of the tax. But the error was still made. A true statement by Chen was turned into a false statement by Ax The Bev Tax.

pomt-04506	Says Obama promised to cut the deficit in half.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-promised-cut-deficit-half/	At the first presidential debate, Mitt Romney said President Barack Obama had broken an important promise. "You've been president four years," Romney said at the Oct. 3, 2012, debate in Denver. "You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. …" He added, "I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half. And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn't get the job done." We’ve heard the claim before that Obama promised to cut the deficit in half. Let’s review our findings. Remarks from 2009 Obama indeed made the pledge on Feb. 23, 2009, following a "Fiscal Responsibility Summit" one month after his inauguration. His words: "Today I am pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office. Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." He said then that the nation’s $1.3 trillion deficit was the largest in the nation’s history. That figure was mostly unchanged through fiscal year 2011. In 2012? It’s expected to be $1.1 trillion, according to the nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office in an August 2012 report. The estimate marks the fourth year in a row with a deficit of more than $1 trillion, the CBO noted, although the projection is down slightly from the $1.2 trillion deficit that CBO projected in March. "This year’s deficit will be three-quarters as large as the deficit in 2009 when measured relative to the size of the economy," the report noted. So the deficit is shrinking, but it’s nowhere near half the level from 2009. PolitiFact Florida previously asked the Obama campaign about the pledge. The campaign pointed us to Obama’s response when asked about it by an Atlanta TV station in February 2012. "Well, we're not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized," he said. "Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. …" Our ruling Romney reminded Obama during the debate, "you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half." The statement is accurate. Obama made the pledge shortly after taking office in 2009. Today, the deficit is smaller, but it’s not half the size it was. We rate Romney’s statement True.

pomt-00460	Says Jacky Rosen "skipped work ... at the expense of veterans" to "attend a publicity stunt."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/16/dean-heller/did-nevadas-jacky-rosen-skip-key-veterans-vote-pho/	Judging by the number of video testimonials on his YouTube channel, Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller is proud of the work he’s done to help veterans get their benefits. In contrast, he says his Democratic opponent has let them down. In June, he charged in a press release that Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., failed to vote on benefits for victims of Agent Orange, a Vietnam-era toxic herbicide. "Congresswoman Jacky Rosen went AWOL on Nevada’s veterans once again yesterday when she skipped work to attend a publicity stunt instead of voting to expand coverage for Vietnam War heroes who are literally dying from exposure to Agent Orange – a bill Dean Heller has cosponsored in the Senate. "If a trip to the southern border was so important to her, Rosen could’ve traveled over the weekend. Instead, she chose to pal around Nevada with Elizabeth Warren and — at the expense of these veterans — ignore the job she was elected to do." A PAC tied to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., targets the same issue in an ad now playing in the Las Vegas market. A reader asked us about Heller’s initial press release, so we decided to find out whether Rosen, in Heller’s words, skipped work at the expense of veterans to attend a publicity stunt. Key takeaways Yes, Rosen was absent for the vote. The bill had 330 cosponsors, including Rosen, and no opposition. It passed 382-0 under rules reserved for sure-to-pass bills, a status known three days before the vote. On the day of the vote, Rosen was on an official visit to a child detention center near the Mexico border at a time when the Trump administration’s family separation policy faced intense scrutiny. The Agent Orange bill Agent Orange is a catchall term for a blend of herbicides the U.S. military sprayed over the jungle during the Vietnam War to reduce enemy cover. The Veterans Affairs Department links exposure to a long list of diseases, including leukemia, diabetes, Parkinson’s, prostate cancer and many more. On Jan. 5, 2017, a bipartisan group of three Republican and two Democratic congressmen introduced the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act. The bill said any sailor who served in the Vietnam theater was eligible for treatment for diseases tied to Agent Orange. They wouldn’t need to prove a connection. A connection would be presumed. The measure quickly gained cosponsors. Rosen added her name about five weeks after introduction. In the months that followed, another 123 lawmakers signed on and ultimately 330 of them stood behind the bill. So if Rosen wasn’t among the very first, she was in one of the earlier waves of supporters. On Dec. 22, 2017, Rosen co-signed a letter with her colleagues (see her signature on page 5) to House Speaker Paul Ryan asking that the bill be allowed to move forward even though it lacked a specific way to pay for its cost. The vote On June 25, 2018, the House passed the bill by a vote of 382-0, with 45 members not voting. A couple of points bear noting. With 330 cosponsors, little short of an act of God would have prevented passage. In line with that, there’s a special place within House procedure for non-controversial legislation. When at least two-thirds of members back a bill, it can pass under a fast-track motion to suspend the rules. That’s important because in order for a bill to get that treatment, it has to be posted as such three days before the vote, in this case, by June 22, 2018. That day, House Democratic leadership emailed that schedule to Rosen and other Democrats. Rosen took her trip on June 25, or in other words, after it was known that the bill was on the suspension calendar. "Bills are scheduled under suspension because they are suspected to secure a two-thirds vote easily," said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center. "Most pass on voice votes." With a voice vote, the presiding officer calls for the ayes and the nays and that’s it. But in this case, they had a roll call vote, which was announced the morning of June 25. As the Heller campaign sees it, Rosen didn’t do her job on behalf of veterans. "She skipped the vote," said Heller spokesman Keith Schipper. "The Monday of the vote, she decided it was more important to shoot a commercial than showing up to do the job she was elected to do, which was voting to expand coverage for veterans suffering from the effects of Agent Orange." Rosen’s physical vote would have had no impact on the outcome. Heller’s press release said she "skipped work." So what was she doing on the day of the vote? Rosen’s trip On June 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reverse his previous policy and stop the separation of families at the border. By that time, the government had placed about 2,000 children in facilities spread across the country. There were questions about the conditions the children were living in, and even more questions about how the government would reunite them with their parents. Rosen, along with 15 other House Democrats, introduced a bill directing the Homeland Security Department to reunite families. That came the day after Trump had reversed course. On June 25, the day of the Agent Orange vote, she started her day in El Paso, Texas, to meet with the American Civil Liberties Union, a group that was monitoring the separation policy. Rosen toured a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing facility, and an unaccompanied minor facility in Tornillo, Texas. She went with another House Democrat, Salud Carbajal from California. "This visit to the border was for official business in her role as a member of Congress who has been proactively working to fix our broken immigration system and end President Trump's heartless family separation policy," said Ilse Zuniga, press secretary in Rosen’s congressional office. Zuniga added that immigration has been a priority for Rosen during her time in office. Official visits are part of congressional work. Each member gets an allowance and so long as it’s for work, they can spend it pretty much how they like. Staff salaries, office expenses, printing and travel are all fair game. It would have been one thing if Rosen were on vacation, but she wasn’t. Heller’s campaign takes issue with a campaign ad Rosen made using photos and footage from her trip to the border. That’s the "publicity stunt" part of their claim. That would be in the eye of the beholder. Gaining useful first hand knowledge can come alongside picking up images that work well in a campaign. The two are not mutually exclusive. Our ruling Heller said that Rosen skipped work at the expense of veterans for a publicity stunt. Heller highlighted his own support as a cosponsor of a companion measure in the Senate — but he forgot to highlight the same of Rosen. Rosen did miss the vote. The bill faced zero opposition, was on a formal fast-track for passage, and passed 382-0. Rosen didn’t skip "work." She made an official visit, along with another congressman, to sites near the Mexican border that were relevant to legislation she introduced related to family separation at the border. The thread of accuracy here is Rosen missed a vote. We rate this claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Dean Heller	None	None	None	2018-08-16T14:01:46	2018-06-26	['None']
pomt-05543	"Under President Obama, domestic oil production is at an eight-year high."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/apr/09/barack-obama/barack-obama-ad-says-us-oil-production-eight-year-/	President Barack Obama is firing back at criticism of his energy policies with a television campaign ad airing in Virginia and many other states. "Under President Obama, domestic oil production is at an eight-year high," the announcer intones as charts appear on the screen. The commercial says "Big Oil" is against Obama because he wants to take away its tax breaks and supports development of alternative fuels. It says Mitt Romney, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, backs the oil companies’ positions. The ad makes a number of claims, but here we’ll focus on the assertion that, under Obama, American oil production is at an eight-year high. The PolitiFact national staff examined a similar statement in January, made in the president’s State of the Union address, and rated it Mostly True. We’ll update the assessment based on some new data. We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said "oil production," we looked at crude oil extracted from U.S. territory. Here are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003: 2003: 2,073,453,000 2004: 1,983,302,000 2005: 1,890,106,000 2006: 1,862,259,000 2007: 1,848,450,000 2008: 1,811,817,000 2009: 1,956,596,000 2010: 2,000,521,000 2011: 2,065,366,000 The data shows that domestic oil production is in fact at its highest level in eight years. Obama campaign claims. Only one month of statistics is available for 2012. They show that in January, the U.S. produced 188.9 million barrels of oil, the largest monthly output since August 1998. Although the numbers are rising, production levels actually have remained pretty stable over the last nine years. Last year’s output was only 14 percent higher than the lowest year during that span. So the increase the Obama campaign cites is not particularly dramatic. In addition, levels of production were typically higher from the 1950s to the 1990s. Does Obama deserve credit for the recent increase? Federal lands, which the president controls, produced 31.8 percent of domestic oil last year, slightly below the nine-year average of 33.4 percent, according to an EIA report. The increase in production last year came on state and privately-owned lands, which yielded almost 150 million barrels more than 2010. In contrast, 2011 production on federal lands dropped by 83 million from a nine-year high mark achieved in 2010. Federal lands yielded 646 million barrels of oil in 2011, almost exactly the nine-year average. But production on federal land has remained steadily above the low-mark of 575 million barrels in 2008, the last year of the Bush administration. Our ruling Obama’s commercial is accurate in saying domestic oil production is at its highest level in eight years. The suggestion of the ad, however, overstates the administration’s role in achieving these results. Much of the increase in production during under Obama has come from state and private lands that the president does not control. So we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-09277	Under the new Arizona immigration law, police can't stop someone to check their immigration status unless they think they see something illegal.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/28/john-huppenthal/arizona-immigration-law-requires-police-see-crime-/	Does Arizona's tough new immigration law, set to take effect in 90 days, protect the innocent from police abuses? Generally speaking, the law signed by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. One of the key questions to emerge has been what standard law enforcement officers would need to use before questioning individuals about their immigration status. This topic came up on the April 26 edition of the MSNBC program Hardball, in a three-way discussion between host Chris Matthews; Republican state Sen. John Huppenthal, a supporter of the new law; and former Democratic state Sen. Alfredo Gutierrez, an opponent of the law. Here is an excerpt from their conversation, edited for space: Matthews: "Under the law you passed and was signed by the governor this week, can a police officer who spots a car with five or six people in it, who he thinks because of instinct, experience, whatever, evidence, whatever you use -- can he stop that car and say, I think these people are here illegally, I'm going to stop and check them? Can he under the law do that, without any crime involved? Can he do that?" Huppenthal: "No, he cannot. That would be -- that would just simply be racial profiling, and that would not be permitted under the law. Now, if he stopped them for speeding or something like that, he can inquire of the driver at that point if they were an illegal immigrant. But you're not going to find that kind of activity. That kind of kind of activity is not going to be -- that's not going to be a part of training. What is going to be a part of training, I arrest somebody for burglary, I arrest them for DUI, I arrest them after they've maimed somebody...." Gutierrez: "Obviously, the senator hasn't read his own bill. What this bill does is, it says that any police officer can stop anyone who appears to them to be reasonably suspicious of being an undocumented person. And I'm going tell you something, if you and I are walking down the street, you're not going to be the subject ... of reasonable suspicion. He is simply wrong about his own bill. I suggest he read it." We'll rate Gutierrez' contribution to this conversation in a separate item. Here we'll tackle Huppenthal's comment. Let's start by looking at exactly what the law says. Here's the part telling law enforcement officers that they need to check on individuals' immigration status: "For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation." So a key question is whether there be "reasonable suspicion" about someone's legal status in the absence of a crime -- major or minor -- being committed or suspected. If the answer is yes, it would undercut Huppenthal's argument. In discussing these questions with legal experts, we found that everyone agreed that there's some gray area that will need to be sorted out in future court decisions. That said, the general consensus was that police could indeed stop someone even in the absence of suspicion that a crime was being committed. Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor, said that law enforcement officers can use profiling rather than suspicions of a specific crime being committed. "Police departments come up with profiles that can establish a resonable suspicion," Spiro said. Such profiles "entitle an officer to stop someone and say, 'I'd like to ask you some questions?' The officer can then investigate, which could lead to probable cause." And at that point, Spiro said, an immigration status check would be acceptable under the Arizona law -- even if no specific crime was witnessed or suspected. "If you came up with a profile for undocumented immigrants, that would establish reasonable suspicion, and you could stop that person even if no other crime was suspected," he said. This would seem to undercut Huppenthal's position. But one factor in his favor is that it's not necessarily easy to use profiles in this way. Spiro said the challenge is drawing up a defensible profile for spotting illegal immigrants. "You can't stop someone just because they look Hispanic," Spiro said, because the law specifically says that officers "may not solely consider race, color or national origin." As a result, Spiro said, "there has to be some other factor or factors, not all of which are race-based, as well as some empirical explanation of why that profile establishes a reasonable suspicion. You have to come up with something beside race that sounds plausible as correlating with undocumented status, and it's hard to say what that would be." There are other reasons to believe that someone could be questioned on their immigration status without a police officer actually suspecting a crime. Jennifer Chacon, law professor at the University of California (Irvine), raises concerns about the phrase "lawful contact." "Lawful contact can occur in many instances when there is no reasonable suspicion of a crime," she said. "A consensual encounter, such as asking a police officer for directions, reporting a crime to a police officer, or being a victim of a crime or a witness and being questioned by a police officer, is a 'lawful encounter.' Also lawful are some stops premised on absolutely no individualized reasonable suspicion -- think about DUI checkpoints where everyone is stopped even if there is no individualized suspicion for the stop. The bill is clear that so long as the initial encounter is lawful, a police officer can then ascertain my legal status upon suspicion that I am undocumented. So Huppenthal is wrong if he maintains that only those suspected of criminal activity can be questioned regarding status. Under the plain language of the law, any time the police engage in a lawful encounter, that is enough to trigger the inquiry into status upon reasonable suspicion." And some of the potential crimes that could lead to questioning involve seemingly innocuous actions. In an effort to curb day-laborer gathering points -- the ad-hoc spots where illegal immigrants have often offered themselves as informal laborers -- the law makes it unlawful "for a person to enter a motor vehicle that is stopped on a street, roadway or highway in order to be hired by an occupant of the motor vehicle and to be transported to work at a different location if the motor vehicle blocks or impedes the normal movement of traffic." It also is now "unlawful for a person who is unlawfully present in the United States and who is an unauthorized alien to knowingly apply for work [or] solicit work in a public place." And how does the law define "solicit"? As a "verbal or nonverbal communication by a gesture or a nod that would indicate to a reasonable person that a person is willing to be employed." So, presumably, anyone getting into a car, or making a gesture or a nod in a public place, could fall under suspicion of violating these laws -- which in turn could open the door to an individual being questioned about their immigration status. None of this means that law enforcement officers will fully exercise these powers -- or that judges will let them. But most legal experts we asked felt that the law opened the door to police questioning of individuals who are not specifically suspected of committing a crime. Perhaps the ambiguities of the law will one day be settled in the courts. But we think that a close reading of the statute and the views of the experts we contacted allow us to draw some conclusions. Huppenthal's position -- that the police must suspect that something illegal is being committed before asking someone for proof of legal status -- is not correct. The law says the police officer just needs "reasonable suspicion'' that the person is an alien who is unlawfully in the United States. The police are prohibited from using a profile based solely on racial or ethnic factors, but that standard can be sidestepped. In addition, some seemingly innocuous behaviors like getting in a car or making a gesture or nodding could be seen by a law officer as "reasonable suspicion" of the newly enacted prohibition against seeking work while in the United States illegally. The passage in the law citing racial profiling does provide some protection, as does the difficulty of defining a profile for illegal immigrants that could pass legal muster, but the law leaves open several possibilities for police questioning individuals without seeing or suspecting a specific crime. So we rate Huppenthal's statement False.	None	John Huppenthal	None	None	None	2010-04-28T17:21:36	2010-04-26	['Arizona']
pomt-01350	Says high-speed rail would have created 60,000 jobs.	false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/21/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-rick-scott-rejected-high-speed-rail-/	In an exchange during Florida’s final gubernatorial debate that was emblematic of the race, Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist cast accusations over who was to blame for the nasty campaign. Scott said his Democratic challenger was a divider and a mudslinger. Crist shot back that the Republican incumbent was unwilling to work with a Democratic president to the detriment of the state. His proof? Scott’s rejection of federal high-speed rail money in 2011. "I reached across the aisle when I was your governor. I worked with the president to get the recovery funds. This governor, Gov. Rick Scott, won't work with the president, even to get high-speed rail, which is so important to central Florida and eventually the whole state. It would've been $2.4 billion to Florida, some say 60,000 jobs." He later repeated the number saying the state was "offered" 60,000 jobs. Scott refused $2.4 billion in federal funds for a proposed Tampa-to-Orlando high-speed line when he first came into office in 2011, joining several other Republican governors in rejecting federal stimulus money and squashing President Barack Obama’s vision for a modernized light-rail network. But would the project have created 60,000 jobs? The Crist campaign didn’t get back to us, but it’s not the first time someone claimed the rail line would have created 60,000 jobs. The number stood out to us in February 2011 when Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville, said it on the House floor because it was the largest estimate we had heard. It was, and still is, a misleading figure. By the Florida Department of Transportation’s own estimates, the project would have created 49,990 jobs — 23,600 direct jobs, like construction and design, and 26,300 indirect jobs, like those created for equipment suppliers. So right away, claiming this new high-speed rail would create 60,000 jobs is highballing the state’s estimate by about 10,000. But even the 50,000-job figure is fuzzy. Here’s why. The state transportation department calculated these jobs in something called "job-years," which, in short, refers to the number of jobs that will be funded each year. The project would have taken place over a four-year period and in each year a different number of workers would have been needed to facilitate construction. Some people could work all four years, others might just be needed for a few months. A report by the Central Florida Partnership, an Orlando-area economic development group, explained it more bluntly: Peak rail employment would occur between fall 2012-14 and require about 10,000 workers. That excludes indirect jobs. So at the height of construction, about 10,000 people would be needed. But those jobs would be temporary. After the rail line is up and running, FDOT said it will create 600 permanent jobs to operate the 84-mile line and 500 permanent spinoff jobs. The best way to look at the rail project is to say that it would have employed directly or indirectly 6,200 workers in 2011, 21,600 workers in 2012, 18,900 workers in 2013, 2,100 workers in 2014. About 1,100 permanent jobs would be needed after the rail was operational. That’s a far cry from 60,000 jobs. Our ruling Crist said "some say 60,000 jobs" would have been created by a Tampa-to-Orlando high-speed rail line. Some may say that, but they would be wrong. Even a cursory reading of the state’s estimates put the figure at about 50,000, significantly less than what Crist claimed. A detailed explanation shows a more nuanced forecast. Basically, the project pays for 50,000 one-year salaries over the course of four years. At the high-point, 21,600 workers would be needed in 2011, but just 2,100 in 2014. About 1,100 permanent jobs would be created thereafter. We rate the statement False.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-10-21T21:56:24	2014-10-21	['None']
pomt-12852	"The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/02/donald-trump/trump-claims-obama-made-deal-take-thousands-illega/	Did Donald Trump really hang up on the Australian prime minister? That’s what a Washington Post report based on anonymous sources says. Reportedly, the heated Jan. 28 exchange was about a refugee agreement between the United States and Australia, countries that are usually close allies. We can’t know how the call really went down, but a few days later, Trump slammed the agreement publicly on Twitter. "Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!" Trump tweeted Feb. 1. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s tweet mischaracterizes the deal in two ways. First, the deal involves fewer than 2,000 people. That’s not "thousands." Second, the individuals would not come to the United States illegally, but through the legal refugee program. Background on the Australian deal Australia has a strict policy against illegal maritime arrivals. The country has intercepted migrants at sea and sent them to regional processing centers on Pacific islands away from Australia, specifically Nauru and Manus. (Manus is part of Papua New Guinea). Instances of abuse have been reported at the centers, with the United Nations calling for the closure of the Nauru facilities after claims of "violence, sexual assault, degrading treatment and self-harm." Papua New Guinea’s Supreme Court in April 2016 ruled that detaining refugees at the Manus facility was illegal, because they had not willfully entered the island. Australian officials said in August they would close the Manus facility but still would not accept the detainees into their country. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in November 2016 that his government reached an agreement with the United States for the resettlement of refugees held in its regional processing centers. Most of those refugees are from Iran, Iraq and Somalia. The centers held 1,254 individuals — not "thousands" as Trump said — as of a November 2016 immigration detention report. "The priority under this arrangement will be for resettlement of those who are most vulnerable, namely women, children and families," Turnbull said in a statement. He also said the United States would assess the refugees and decide which ones would be resettled in America. He said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was supporting the arrangement. Worldwide, the United States accepted 84,994 refugees in fiscal year 2016 (Oct. 1, 2015-Sept. 30, 2016) out of a cap of 85,000, according to data from the State Department’s Refugee Processing Center. Obama’s administration last year said it would raise the refugee admission ceiling to 110,000 in fiscal year 2017. But in his Jan. 27 executive order, Trump said the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal 2017 "would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest." Up to Jan. 27, the United States had admitted 32,125 refugees. After extensive vetting, refugees arrive legally in the United States and are required by law to apply for a green card one year after their arrival. The fate of the deal The U.S.-Australian deal resurfaced after Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27 temporarily halting the refugee admission program and the admission of nationals from seven countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen -- flagged by the Obama administration as terrorist hotbeds. The White House’s official readout of the next day’s phone call simply states, "Both leaders emphasized the enduring strength and closeness of the U.S.-Australia relationship that is critical for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and globally." Turnbull told reporters on Jan. 30 that he and Trump had a "constructive" conversation, adding, "We also discussed the resettlement arrangement of refugees from Nauru and Manus, which had been entered into with the previous administration, and I thank President Trump for his commitment to honour that existing agreement." The White House has given conflicting signals about the fate of the deal. Sean Spicer, Trump’s press secretary, said during a Jan. 31 press briefing that the deal to take in 1,250 refugees would go on, applying extreme vetting to potential arrivals as was agreed in the deal. The day after Trump’s tweet, Turnbull told the Wall Street Journal that Australia was still negotiating refugee agreements with other governments, but couldn’t accept them given its laws banning the resettlement of asylum seekers coming by boat. "Our expectation naturally, given the commitments that have been made, is that it will go ahead," Turnbull said. "The only option that isn’t available to (the refugees) is bringing them to Australia for the obvious reasons that that would provide a signal to the people smugglers to get back into business." Spicer, at a press briefing Feb. 2, said the president was "unbelievably disappointed" by the "horrible deal" cut by the Obama administration, but said the process would continue under "extreme vetting" conditions. Given his opposition to the deal, Trump would be able to walk back on it, as it appears to be an executive-to-executive agreement, said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School. "The new U.S. executive could back away from what Obama agreed to," Yale-Loehr said. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia." Trump’s referring to a deal for the United States to take in 1,250 people -- mostly from Iran, Iraq and Somalia -- held by Australia in offshore detention centers. The detainees were caught at sea by Australian officials as they tried to illegally land on the island. The United States is expected to vet the individuals and determine who will be accepted as refugees. Refugees arrive in the United States legally. Trump’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-13443	Says "Marco Rubio wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare because he said they’re bankrupting our country."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/sep/16/senate-majority-pac/fact-checking-democratic-attacks-marco-rubios-stat/	Two Democratic groups say Republican Sen. Marco Rubio wants to cut Social Security and Medicare -- programs that millions of Florida seniors rely on each year. "Marco Rubio wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare because he said they’re bankrupting our country. But that’s what politicians say when the insurance industry bankrolls their campaigns. Marco Rubio has taken almost $1 million from the insurance industry which was profit from his privatization plans," says the narrator in a TV ad by the Senate Majority PAC and AFSCME People. The PAC aims to elect Democrats to the Senate, including U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, while AFSCME is a union representing public workers. We found that Rubio’s views are much more nuanced than the ad suggests. Rubio’s 2010 Senate campaign About 21 percent of Florida’s population -- about 3.9 million people -- receive Social Security benefits. About 4 million Floridians use Medicare for health insurance. Both programs face long-term financing shortfalls, leading program trustees and experts on the federal budget to call on lawmakers to take action -- something many are unwilling to do out of fear of repercussions at the ballot box. Finding ways to pay for the programs in the long-term is important because together they accounted for 41 percent of federal program expenditures in fiscal year 2015. During his first U.S. Senate campaign in 2010, Rubio called for reforming entitlement programs. Specifically, Rubio said in 2010 that he was open to raising the retirement age. "Privatization of the accounts has come and gone, (but) there are other alternatives, such as (raising) the retirement age, how you adjust payments in the future, 'need' measures, et cetera." The retirement age came up again during a Fox News Sunday debate. Host Chris Wallace asked Rubio if he would raise the retirement age. "I think that has to be on the table. That's got to be part of the solution. The retirement age that gradually increases for people of my generation, I think has got to be part of ...," Rubio said before getting cut off. Rubio was asked if he would support changing cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security beneficiaries. "I think all of that has to be on the table, including the way we index increases in cost of living. All of these issues have to be on the table," Rubio said. "They have to be options that I would be open to." Rubio consistently said that while he wouldn’t make changes for those 55 and older, younger people such as himself (he was 39 at the time) would have to accept changes. After Rubio was elected The Senate Majority PAC’s ad cites Rubio’s comments from 2011. In March 2011, Rubio voted for a House-passed measure to cut about $61 billion from the budget through the end of the year. "While reducing discretionary spending is an important goal, Washington is devoting a disproportionate amount of time to a tiny slice of the budget while ignoring the fact that continued inaction on saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is bankrupting our country," Rubio said in a press release. In 2014, Rubio gave a speech at the National Press Club in which he again said inaction would lead to bankruptcy. Rubio called to "gradually increase the retirement age for future retirees to account for the rise in life expectancy." As for Medicare, he called for a "premium support system" that would give seniors a fixed amount of money to purchase insurance from Medicare or a private provider. That was similar to a plan by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Rubio voted for the Ryan budgets that included reductions in future Medicare spending. The burden would have fallen on beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket. While running for president in 2016, Rubio again called for reducing the debt by making changes to Social Security and Medicare. At a March debate in Miami, Rubio reiterated his stance about raising the retirement age but not for those who are 55 or older. "Social Security will go bankrupt, and it will bankrupt the country with it," he said. "So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents." Rubio’s 2016 race While running for re-election, Rubio reiterated the same proposals for Social Security. "Marco's own mother relies on Social Security as her sole source of income," Rubio spokesman Michael Ahrens said. "Marco would never do anything to hurt his mother or the millions of Florida seniors who depend on Social Security and Medicare, and he'll continue to fight to strengthen the programs for future generations." His campaign staff also point to previous PolitiFact analysis that said that reining in the spending growth of a program like Medicare wasn’t the same as cutting it. Our ruling TV ads say that Marco Rubio "wanted to cut Social Security and Medicare because he said they’re bankrupting our country." Rubio has repeatedly said since 2010 that those programs will bankrupt the United States. His plan to raise the retirement age would amount to a cut for those recipients. He supported the Ryan budgets that included reductions in future Medicare spending. The ad omits that his proposals to change Social Security would not affect current retirees or people nearing retirement.

pomt-11311	The "moon has more than 250 million citizens."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/13/blog-posting/no-evidence-250-million-moon-inhabitants-s-fake-ne/	A online hoax claims, entirely without evidence, that 250 million inhabitants currently live on, or inside, the moon. The headline, from a website called Mysterious Earth, states "CIA Release Documents Of Moon, Moon Has More Than 250 Million Citizens." But the article makes no reference to released CIA documents, and provides not a shred of proof to back up the claim that a civilization roughly the size of Pakistan’s population lives on the moon. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article opens with a mangled quote misattributed to theoretical physicist Albert Einstein: "Contemplation without investigation is the height of ignorance." (As the sleuths at metabunk.org point out, the real quote appears to trace back to 18th century British theologian William Paley, who criticized formulating contempt without investigation.) Next, the item suggests that the very fact that it’s conceivable that hundreds of millions of inhabitants live on the moon — no matter how improbable — gives credence to the argument that a substantial lunar civilization already exists. (This argument, which takes the logical form of "X is possible, therefore X is true," is a logical fallacy known as an appeal to possibility.) Yet in the very next breath the author doubles back, acknowledging "this may not be true." The item then cycles through a host of fringe theories, including the Spaceship Moon hypothesis (also known as the Hollow Moon hypothesis). This idea, put forth in 1970 by two members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, holds that the moon is actually a hollow spaceship built by aliens. This theory has been roundly debunked by planetary scientists. Dr. Renee Weber, who manages the Heliophysics and Planetary Science Division at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, said in a 2011 interview that none of NASA’s findings support the Hollow Moon theory. Karen Masters, an associate professor in astronomy and astrophysics at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth in England, also addressed the fringe theory in a 2015 online forum hosted by Cornell University. "The Moon is not hollow," Masters said. "It is possible to tell this because when we have had things in orbit around the Moon, how they orbit in the Moon's gravity tells us about the mass of the Moon. We also know the size of the Moon so we can work out the density and see that it is not possible for the Moon to be hollow." This bogus item follows a familiar fake news formula, wending its way from a shocking clickbait-y headline, through muddled reasoning that attempts to buttress an ultimately absurd central premise. One thing that is true: This claim is hollow. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-04-13T14:00:12	2018-04-08	['None']
pomt-05693	Georgia ranks "last in job growth."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/12/ted-jackson/data-mostly-backs-job-loss-claim/	With an overcrowded jail, a courthouse to protect and criminals to help catch, Fulton County Sheriff Ted Jackson says his deputies have enough to do and don’t need additional duties proposed by a state lawmaker. The Democratic sheriff of Georgia’s highest-populated county recently fired off a letter to Sen. Don Balfour, a Gwinnett County Republican, objecting to Senate Bill 469, which would fine people and groups who conduct mass protests at someone’s home and cause a ruckus. Sheriff’s deputies would occasionally be involved in stopping these protests. Here’s part of Jackson’s objection to the bill: "The role of law enforcement shouldn’t be to police free speech but the intent of this bill seems to be just that. By targeting only protests dealing with labor disputes, you are putting police officers in the difficult position of silencing the voices of Georgians and, in the process, setting us up to face potential lawsuits that would ultimately be paid for by taxpayers." But this part of the letter, published in the Feb. 29 edition of Creative Loafing, made us interested. "Finally, I believe this bill serves no useful purpose in fighting crime. Working daily throughout the communities of Fulton County gives me the opportunity to interact with varied segments of the population and see firsthand how citizens are suffering under the sluggish economy. Our state has an unemployment rate close to 10%, which is higher than the national average, while ranking last in job growth." We’ve fact-checked claims about Georgia’s high unemployment rate before. But PolitiFact Georgia wondered about the final passage of that paragraph: is Georgia last in job growth? Most economist measure job growth in a state by using U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from one period and comparing it against another period. PolitiFact Georgia decided to measure the most recent 12-month period. In December 2011, the most recent month available when Jackson wrote his letter, an estimated 3,809,800 Georgians were employed. In December 2010, approximately 3,823,700 Georgians had jobs. That’s a decline of nearly 14,000 jobs during that time period. Only four states had a decline during that time period: Alaska, Delaware, Georgia and Missouri. Georgia had the largest decline. So far, so good for the accuracy of Sheriff Jackson’s claim. The five states with the greatest increase were, in order, California, Texas, Florida, New York and Ohio. Wait! Those states are also some of the highest-populated in the country. Is the number of job losses the only way we should be measuring this? Georgia has a higher population than the three other states with job losses. Maybe that’s why the Peach State had more job losses than any other state. We decided to do some more math to look at the percentage of job growth or decline in each state. In Georgia, the decrease was 0.36 percent. Delaware, at 0.68 percent, and Alaska, at 0.52 percent had a greater decline. The Atlanta-based Georgia Budget & Policy Institute recently put together a fact-sheet on how Georgia fares nationally in job growth. Like us, they measured the percentage change in job growth. "That way, you are counting for the difference in sizes (of each state)," said Alan Essig, the institute’s director. Since the official end of the Great Recession (June 2009), Georgia ranked 49th out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. in job growth, the institute found. Only Missouri and Nevada had a larger percentage decline in job growth, they found. The institute also looked at the same time period we did and came up with the same numbers, concluding that Alaska and Delaware ranked lower in job growth. Essig also told us that since December 2007, the only states with a greater percentage decline in job growth were Arizona, Florida and Nevada. Jackson’s office presented us an Atlanta Business Chronicle article that found Georgia was second to last in job creation between July 2010 and July 2011, saved from being dead last by Indiana. The article focused on the decline in jobs, not the percentage change. The sheriff’s spokeswoman, Tracy Flanagan, also sent us a November 2011 report that showed Georgia had the largest percentage decline in employed workers in any state between June 2009 and September 2011, which was just over 2 percent. Georgia does not look good here, any way you examine these numbers. Georgia did have a larger decline in jobs than any other state over the most recent 12 months available. However, the percentage of that decline was not as great as two other states. Other research shows Georgia was close to last since 2007 and 2009. The sheriff’s claim that Georgia was "last" in job growth is on target, but needs a little clarification. We rate the claim as Mostly True.

pomt-14041	California’s Capitol building is "second only to Disneyland," among visitor sites in the state.	false	/california/statements/2016/may/27/richard-pan/mickey-mouse-claim-californias-capitol-building-se/	California is home to some of the most popular tourist attractions anywhere: Disneyland, the San Diego Zoo and Yosemite National Park quickly come to mind. They’ll likely be top destinations for travelers over the Memorial Day holiday. But an old wives’ tale in Sacramento would have you believe the state Capitol building ranks "second only to Disneyland" in annual visitors across the Golden State. State Sen. Richard Pan repeated this myth at a recent hearing at the Capitol. "We have all these visitors coming here, second only to Disneyland, and yet when you look up there’s something missing -- fire sprinklers," said Pan, D-Sacramento, on April 7, 2016. "We have all those people walking through here, but if there’s a fire we’re in big trouble." Pan’s claim about the number of visitors sounded dubious. We set out to examine whether the Capitol really is "second only to Disneyland." We didn’t check whether it was the second ‘happiest place on Earth.’ Sen. Richard Pan says the state Capitol is "second only to Disneyland" in visitors in this Sacramento Bee video. Our research The Capitol attracts roughly one million visitors inside the building annually, according to figures provided by the Capitol museum, which is part of the state parks department and runs tours of the building. Of those, about half take tours and visit the museum, while the rest are there on official business, said Tabitha Mwai, a Capitol tour guide employed through the museum. The domed, neo-classical structure houses the state legislature and governor’s office. It was first built in the late 1800s. It buzzes with life on a typical day with lawmakers and lobbyists competing for space with school groups, reporters and sometimes protesters inside its cramped hallways. While Pan sounded like he was referring to visitors inside, we checked on the number outside, too. Nearly 1,000 permitted events from small press conferences to large rallies take place on the Capitol grounds each year, according to Officer Mike Martis, Jr., a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol, which administers the permits. Martis said the agency does not keep data on how many people attend the events. He offered a very rough and unofficial estimate of between 50,000 and 100,000 annually. The Capitol building is home to the California State Legislature, including the Assembly Chamber shown above. File photo / Capital Public Radio Going with this approximation, we’ll say the Capitol draws 1.1 million inside and out. That’s a lot of visitors. But what about attractions other than Disneyland? Yosemite? The San Diego Zoo? The Monterey Bay Aquarium, among others? A comprehensive list ranking attendance at the state’s top attractions is difficult to find. But the attractions we listed all draw far more visitors each year. Disneyland is the apparent top draw at 16 million paid visitors, according to Statista, a statistics company. Yosemite attracts about 4 million people each year, according to the National Park Service, while the San Diego Zoo welcomes 3.2 million annually, according to a zoo spokeswoman. The Monterey Bay Aquarium, meanwhile, reported more than 2 million in total attendance in 2014. The Capitol’s 1.1 million visitors place it ahead of Hearst Castle’s 770,000, but behind Alcatraz Island’s 1.4 million tally. Lawmaker’s response When we asked where Sen. Pan got his information, his spokeswoman referred us to comments from the same April hearing by California Department of General Services Director Daniel Kim. A video shows Kim stating: "Other than Disneyland, the state Capitol is the second most visited site in California, with millions of visitors annually." Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for that department, said Kim relied on "an old wives’ tale that docents at the Capitol say every time they give a tour." It’s a tale even Maria Shriver, the state’s former First Lady, repeated in a 2009 magazine article, where she said "Our Capitol is one of the most visited places in California, second only to Disneyland." Ferguson said perhaps it was true at one point. Erin Renfree, a state parks Capitol tour guide supervisor who’s led tours there since 1999, said she’s never heard her guides or volunteer docents make that claim. "I’ve never used that on my tours. I’ve never heard any of the tour guides use that," Renfree said. She added the state can’t control what private guides might tell visitors. On Pan’s more serious point about the Capitol, and specifically its attached annex building needing safety upgrades: Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed $1.5 billion in the upcoming budget to renovate or replace that and two other state buildings. Our ruling State Sen. Richard Pan said the state Capitol is "second only to Disneyland" in visitors in California. This center of state government draws about a bit more than one million annually. But that’s peanuts compared with Yosemite, the San Diego Zoo or Monterey Bay Aquarium, which attract between two and four times as many per year. A state spokesman said the claim about the Capitol is "an old wives’ tale." If it ever was correct, it’s long outdated and now just flat out wrong. We rate that part of the senator’s statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-11774	Says Joe Scarborough is party to an "unsolved mystery" from his time as a congressman in Florida.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/29/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-unsolved-mystery-attack-j/	President Donald Trump took to Twitter to celebrate the firing of NBC’s Matt Lauer over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while encouraging the network to look deeper into its employees. "Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for 'inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.' But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack’s past!," Trump tweeted Nov. 29, 2017. He then followed up: "So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the 'unsolved mystery' that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!" Trump mentioned three NBC officials -- Lack, the chairman of NBC News, Griffin, the president of MSNBC, and Scarborough, a former Florida congressman who hosts Morning Joe on MSNBC. In this fact-check, we are focusing on Trump’s attack of Scarborough’s "unsolved mystery." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com What Trump is talking about Trump is referring to an incident in 2001, when a 28-year-old congressional aide to Scarborough was found dead in one of Scarborough’s district offices. Scarborough represented Florida Panhandle counties as a Republican from 1995 to 2001. PolitiFact founder Bill Adair, then the Washington bureau chief for the St. Petersburg Times, covered the death. His report is only 286 words long, so we are republishing it in full. A congressional aide in Fort Walton Beach told people she was feeling ill the day before she was found dead, according to a police report. The Fort Walton Beach Police Department report says Lori Klausutis, an aide to Rep. Joe Scarborough, told a co-worker on July 19 that she was not feeling well, but did not elaborate. She made a similar comment to a mail carrier. She was found dead in Scarborough's district office the next morning by two people who came to seek help with an immigration case. Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Berkland has said Klausutis, 28, of Niceville, lost consciousness because of an abnormal heart rhythm and fell, hitting her head on a desk. The head injury caused the death, Berkland said. The report, which was released Monday, quotes friends and relatives as saying Klausutis was happily married and was known as "Little Miss Mary Sunshine." They said she was under moderate stress in the days before she died. She had two assignments due for college courses. She and her husband had recently moved into a new house, and she was looking for a new job because Scarborough recently resigned from Congress, effective in September. Relatives told police she was upbeat about a job possibility at a local radio station and had recently received a $6,000 raise. Relatives said she had been taking medication for acne and that she suffered a head injury in a traffic accident when she was a teenager that left her in a coma. When she recovered, she had signs of short-term memory loss. A mail carrier who came in the office on July 19 said she appeared nervous. He said Klausutis told him she did not feel well. Unsolved mystery? Hardly The story has dogged Scarborough among conspiracy-minded individuals. Markos Moulitsas, founder of the liberal website Daily Kos, was banned from MSNBC for suggesting Scarborough may have played some role in Klausutis’ death. The guts of the conspiracy theory center around Scarborough’s announcement in May 2001, two months before Klausutis’ death, that he would resign from Congress on Sept. 6, 2001, to spend more time with his two sons. Scarborough was divorced but had joint custody of his two sons. "It's impossible to be a good father and a good congressman," Scarborough said in an interview the St, Petersburg Times, which is now the Tampa Bay Times. "You are home 180 nights out of the year and you're in D.C. 180 nights. No matter where you are, the kids are going to be without you half the year." There’s little more to the conspiracy, but the clarity of the medical examiner’s report did not satisfy people who believe the conspiracy. That list apparently includes Trump. Scarborough responded to the president on Twitter, saying: "Looks like I picked a good day to stop responding to Trump's bizarre tweets. He is not well." Trump has been engaged in a running feud with Scarborough and co-host Mika Brzezinski. Our ruling Trump said Scarborough is party to an "unsolved mystery" from his time as a congressman in Florida. The guts of the attack are nothing more than an unproven conspiracy theory -- no different than President Barack Obama being born outside the United States or Ted Cruz’s father being involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This case is not unsolved. It is not a mystery. Trump's claim rates Pants on Fire!

pomt-15207	"Over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank has passed."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/12/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-slams-dodd-frank-gets-his-numbers-wron/	Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says a law that attempts to stop banks from becoming too big to fail actually ends up making community banks too small to succeed. During the first Republican presidential debate, Rubio called for less regulation, lower taxes, and rolling back the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in the wake of the financial crisis in 2010. "We need to repeal Dodd-Frank. It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks," he said on Aug. 6, 2015, to applause. "Over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank has passed." Rubio’s comment is a new version of an old Republican talking point, so we wanted to take a look. A spokesperson for Rubio referred us to a March 2015 brief by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond that noted a 41 percent decline in small banks between 2007 and 2013. But that’s a smaller category -- not small and mid-size, as Rubio said -- and it starts counting before Dodd-Frank became law. If we focus on the time frame he gives, 2010 to now, Rubio’s figure is overstated. Since 2010, the decline in their numbers is less than half of what Rubio said -- estimates range from 12 percent to 16 percent. Still, regulators say that’s not the full picture, and experts contend that a host of factors other than Dodd-Frank are at play. A 30-year trend First, let’s note that Dodd-Frank was billed as a safeguard against another financial crisis -- "the most far reaching Wall Street reform in history," touts the White House -- and its regulations largely target big banks. So how did mom-and-pop bankers get hit in the crossfire? To understand the shift, we have to look decades before Rubio’s time frame. The number of banks actually began to dwindle in 1980s, as seen in a chart from the Federal Bank of St. Louis: The heart of the matter is why the numbers are going down. According to a 2012 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. report, the majority of the loss comes from consolidation, not closures. In other words, banks were not so much collapsing for good as folding into other banks. This was possible thanks to a slew of laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s that chipped away barriers in banking across communities and state borders (the U.S. Government Accountability Office points to, for example, the Riegle-Neal Act of 1994 and the Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998). So big banks grew bigger, but that doesn’t mean all small banks disappeared. Community banks of different sizes have been subject to different trends. From 1985 to 2013, the number of the smallest institutions has declined dramatically (85 percent to be exact). But mid-size and large community banks have remained relatively stable since 2010 (and have increased, albeit incrementally, since 1985). Here are two FDIC charts from a 2014 report to that point: Two-thirds of failed or voluntarily closed community banks are actually acquired by other community banks, according to the FDIC. The result: fewer, but larger community banks. Their goal: to achieve "economies of scale" (cost advantages gained when spreading out expenses over more revenue), says the U.S. Government Accountability Office. So community banks have an incentive to grow bigger, because they then get more bang for their buck, explains Joe Rizzi, a banking consultant and American Banker columnist. Dodd-Frank’s impact As for how Dodd-Frank plays into all of this, there’s really no consensus. According to a February 2015 report by the Harvard Kennedy School, "Dodd-Frank exacerbated the pre-existing trend of banking consolidation by piling up regulatory costs" on community banks. "It gets so expensive. The people who can really afford the experts and the simple costs are the larger banks," report co-author Marshall Lux told PolitiFact. "The larger banks are ironically protected from other people entering the market." Rizzi emphasized that the decline in the number of community banks came well before 2010. He attributes the change, instead, to the 30-year consolidation trend as well as the FDIC changing its policies on new banks in 2009. Moreover, he contends that fewer small community banks isn’t necessarily a bad thing. "It’s a healthy development. It is better to have fewer sub-scale weak institutions and more stronger banks," he said. Lux and his co-author Robert Greene, however, envision a domino’s effect that mostly hits rural and densely populated communities. "There’s a difference between market-driven consolidation and regulatory-driven consolidation. That leaves gaps. It’s not like a competitor is filling the void," Greene said. "The community banks consolidate into mini-regionals and God knows, you’re then worried about the big banks swallowing those up," added Lux. Back to Rubio Despite their disagreement on Dodd-Frank’s culpability, no one backed Rubio’s claim or his call to repeal the law. Lux, whose report was also cited by Rubio’s campaign, told the Washington Post’s Fact Checker that the senator is "simply wrong." Rizzi put it more harshly: "Trying to blame Dodd-Frank for the ‘decline’ -- I call it change -- in number of community banks is fantasy. Trying to maintain the number and size of community banks is nostalgia. George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life) is dead -- let him rest in peace." Lux, for his part, advocated for reform rather than a complete overhaul of Dodd-Frank. After all, the law’s primary goal is to tackle "too big to fail." Our ruling Rubio said, "Over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank has passed." Rubio’s figure is overstated for the time frame he gives. The highest estimate we found shows a 16 percent decline in the past five years -- less than half of what he said. The trend Rubio describes began decades before Dodd-Frank became law in 2010. Even then, experts say a host of factors other than Dodd-Frank are at play. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-13399	In Richmond, Va., there’s "more moving vans coming in than going out."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/sep/26/jack-berry/jack-berry-says-more-moving-vans-coming-going-out-/	"Richmond is on a roll," said Jack Berry during a Sept. 15 mayoral debate sponsored by the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "Our population is up. Investment is up, more moving vans coming in than going out," the candidate said. We were curious about the last of Berry’s proclamations - that there are "more moving vans coming in than going out" of the city. His campaign pointed us to a January report by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, which each year produces population tallies for the state and local officials for budgeting and planning. The center culls its estimates from a variety of sources, including from school enrollment figures, birth and death records, as well as driver’s license information and housing stock data. A chart in the report says that in July 2015, the most recent period for which figures are available, Richmond’s population was 217,938. That’s an increase of 13,724 from the April 2010 census, when the city had 204,214 people. The surrounding counties of Chesterfield, Henrico and Hanover all saw their populations rise during the same period but none as quickly as Richmond’s 6.8 percent growth. Still, these figures include a rising population driven not just by people moving into Richmond but also births in the city. From April 2010 to mid-2015, there were 5,448 more births than deaths in the city; that accounted for about 40 percent of Richmond’s population growth during that time. To drill down on Berry’s claim - which specifically points to people moving into and out of the city - we need to look at tallies of Richmond’s "net migration," which is the number of people who moved into the city minus those who left it. Between the April 2010 census and mid-2015, Richmond saw a net migration of 8,276 people into the city, Weldon Cooper Center’s figures show. Actually, starting in the mid-2000s the number of people moving into Richmond began to outpace the number who moved away, said Hamilton Lombard, a research specialist at Weldon Cooper. Before then, Lombard said there was a decades-long trend in which more people moved out of the city than into it. From July 2013 to July 2014, Richmond had a net gain of 1,255 people who moved in, Lombard wrote in an email. And from mid-2014 to mid-2015, net migration into the city rose to 3,437. Those are the latest years for which migration tallies are available. The center still is collecting net migration figures for Richmond for the 12-month period starting in July 2015. Early indications show a continued movement into the city, Lombard said. "I think a simple explanation of why Richmond is growing is that developers have created many more housing units in the city in recent years, and more people have wanted to live in the city than in recent decades," Lombard told us. We also found figures from the U.S. Census Bureau that show a rise in the net migration into Richmond. The bureau, which computes net migration differently than Weldon Cooper, estimates a net migration of 11,073 people into the city from April 2010 to mid-2015. About one-third of those additional residents are immigrants who came from abroad, while the rest came from other parts of the U.S. The Internal Revenue Service also tracks how many people are going into and coming out of counties and cities across the U.S., based on tax returns filed with the IRS each year. Unlike the Weldon Cooper and Census Bureau estimates, Lombard said the IRS figures from 2014, the latest year available, still show more people moving out of Richmond than into it. But Lombard cautioned about reading too much into that finding. "Typically, IRS migration data is very reliable, but it can be less accurate with young adults since they change addresses and jobs more often," Lombard wrote in an email. "Given that Richmond has a large young adult population, and much of its recent growth has come from young adults, the IRS data may not be as reliable for tracking Richmond's migration." Lombard noted some college students who move into the city to live and study here might not be picked up in the IRS data because those students are still reported on their parents’ tax returns as living at an address outside Richmond. Also, some young adults might not earn enough to file a return, or may skip filling out a return for a couple of years even though they’re supposed to file, Lombard said. That would make it tougher for the IRS to track their migration patterns, he said. Our ruling Berry said that in Richmond, there’s "more moving vans coming in than going out." Figures from the Census Bureau and the Weldon Cooper Center back Berry’s claim that Richmond has been seeing more people moving into the city than leaving. Figures from the IRS come to a different conclusion, but there’s a question over whether they are reliable when tracking Richmond’s moving patterns. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-01481	In the last 10 years, Georgia’s middle class income has dropped $6,500.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/29/jason-carter/carter-claim-about-median-household-income-target/	Georgia’s economy has been hotly debated in this year’s governor’s race. And in a new television ad, Democratic nominee Jason Carter says power brokers at the state Capitol need to do more for the middle class. "In the last 10 years, Georgia’s middle-class income has dropped $6,500," he says. "We have to change that." The two-term state senator from Atlanta who is hoping to unseat Republican incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal in the Nov. 4 general election has previously voiced concern about the shrinking income of the middle class. At a press conference in January, when 2012 figures were the most recent available, Carter said the income of an average Georgia family, adjusted for inflation, is about $6,000 less than it was 10 years ago. PolitiFact Georgia rated that statement True, albeit on the conservative side. Carter was relying on historical data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The data showed that the median household income in Georgia fell by an estimated $6,682, from $54,803 in 2002 to $48,121 in 2012, when adjusted for inflation. Nationally, in that same period, the median household income dropped from $54,127 to $51,017, or $3,110, according to the Census Bureau’s data. Carter’s new ad cites a $6,500, 10-year drop in household income. That’s even more on target with the Census Bureau data. Still, we decided to go a little further since, after Carter’s ad aired, the Census Bureau came out with new data for 2013. The middle-class income number also provides one more measure for trying to assess what’s going on with Georgia’s economy. It can be a cloudy picture. Deal says nearly 300,000 jobs have been created in his tenure. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says Georgia’s unemployment rate jumped from 6.9 percent in April to 8.1 percent in August. So what’s the latest info on median household income? In the U.S. Census Bureau’s just-released 2013 American Community Survey, Georgia had a median household income of $47,829 in 2013, inflation-adjusted dollars. The state ranked 34th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia, with Maryland the highest at $72,483, Mississippi the lowest at $37,963. The survey said the median household income for the nation was $52,250 — $4,421 higher than Georgia’s. The numbers, however, showed metro Atlanta’s median household income at $55,733. That is above the national average. And more than half of all Georgians live in or near metro Atlanta. Median household income is down for metro Atlanta and Georgia since 2010, the first year after the government says the recession ended and the year Deal was elected governor. Metro Atlanta’s median household income was $56,850 for 2010, and in inflation-adjusted dollars, Georgia’s was $49,412, according to the survey. (Note: Some estimates in the American Community Survey differ from prior estimates.) In inflation-adjusted dollars, Georgia’s median household income was $47,536 in 2011 and $47,811 in 2012. Wesley Tharpe, a policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said income and wages have been basically stagnant in the state for the past two to three years. "What we saw with the Great Recession, starting around 2007, was employment and income just really fell through the floor due to the collapse of the housing market, the collapse of the stock market," Tharpe said. "Those really hurt Georgia because of our reliance on the housing industry and construction jobs." Since that crash, the economy has been gradually moving in the right direction, he said. "But incomes and the ability for families to make a living and make ends meet is really lagging behind," Tharpe said. "We haven’t really seen that much growth since we hit that floor." In summary, Carter’s ad says middle-class income has dropped $6,500 in 10 years. He bases this on historical data from the U.S. Census Bureau. That shows Georgia’s median household income, in inflation-adjusted dollars, fell by $6,682, from $54,803 in 2002 to $48,121 to 2012. We rate Carter’s ad claim as True.

pomt-04033	"I had to lay off 48 people last year," which has exacerbated the lack of law enforcement officers in the county that respond quickly to crime calls.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/31/david-clarke-jr/calling-citizens-get-gun-training-milwaukee-county/	When Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. called on citizens to learn to use guns to defend themselves, he said fewer cops on the street meant that "simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option." The same day, Jan. 25, 2013, he elaborated on the radio spot. He told conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on WISN-AM (1130) in Milwaukee: "We need a new model. We're still operating -- when I say we, in law enforcement -- are operating under an old model that was actually developed in the 1980s. It was called rapid response. Law enforcement officials convinced city leaders to spend a lot of money hiring new officers and they promised that they could get to calls quickly; that's why it was called the rapid response model. "And the elected officials, they went along with it and there was this big hiring of police officers that went on in the ’80s. And there were, at that time, there were enough people to get to calls in a reasonable period of time. "Well since then, obviously, budgets, budget considerations -- cops have been laid off, fewer dollars going into public safety; my own agency, I had to lay off 48 people last year." So, are there 48 fewer sheriff’s deputies responding to urgent crime calls? Most laid off were rehired Clarke’s 30-second public service announcement made national news. He did TV interviews on CNN, Fox and again on CNN, as well as a radio interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity. He repeated his claim about layoffs, though he used a smaller figure than the 48 he cited in the McKenna interview. Clarke refused our request to back up for his claim about 48 layoffs. We went to the files. Because of a budget cut imposed by Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, Clarke was forced to do 48 layoffs in February 2012, according to a news article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. At the time, Clarke’s spokeswoman said no decisions had been made on whether any tasks of the sheriff's office would be curtailed. Seven months later, Clarke said he was rehiring 29 of the deputies because staffing at the county jail was dangerously low. There was no mention of lacking deputies to respond to urgent calls about crime. The number actually rehired as of October 2012 was 25, according to a list provided by Abele’s office. It’s important to note that while the 48 layoffs number was correct, Clarke presented it as if that number was what was currently having a detriment on response times. That is, as if it was the situation as it exists today. It does not, given that more than half of the layoffs have been restored. What’s more, the indication is that the layoffs were in jail positions, not among deputies who may be called on to respond to serious crimes. Role of sheriff Even if the layoffs affected deputies who respond to serious crimes, the fact is the Sheriff’s Office handles only a small percentage of such calls in Milwaukee County. The Sheriff’s Office runs two jails, patrols freeways and provides security for the airport, the courthouse and other facilities. But in terms of crime fighting, its territory is generally limited to properties owned by the county, such as parks. Milwaukee County is heavily urbanized and municipalities have their own police departments that respond to crime calls. In 2010, according to the state Office of Justice Assistance, the Sheriff’s Office responded to just 10 violent crimes. That jumped to 163 in 2011. But the 163 represented just 2 percent of the 7,380 violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault) reported throughout the county in 2011. Similarly, the Sheriff’s Office handled 224 property crimes (burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, arson) in 2011. That was up from 28 in 2010, but comprised less than 1 percent of the 43,615 property crimes in the county. Suffice it to say: If a person in Milwaukee County calls 911 about a serious crime in progress, in the vast majority of cases, a police officer and not a sheriff’s deputy would respond. So, again, the linkage Clarke makes between the layoffs and response times falls flat. Our rating Clarke said: "I had to lay off 48 people last year," which has exacerbated the lack of law enforcement officers in the county that respond quickly to crime calls. The Sheriff’s Office did lay off 48 people in 2012, but most have been rehired. Moreover, the office handles only a fraction of serious crimes in Milwaukee. We rate Clarke’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-12703	The Obama administration said "they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of health care, and that is the emergency rooms. In fact, they did just the opposite."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/10/tom-price/hhs-chief-tom-price-correct-er-use-obamacare/	One of the arguments Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price made about why substantial changes in federal health care law were needed was that the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, had failed in one of its goals -- to cut down on emergency room use. Because emergency rooms by law cannot turn patients away, they can become a health care provider of last resort, even for more minor conditions that could be handled just as well -- and more inexpensively -- in a doctor’s office. "One of the things that the previous administration said was that they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of health care, and that is the emergency rooms," Price said at a White House briefing on March 7, 2017. "In fact, they did just the opposite." Is Price correct that emergency room usage has gone up -- not down -- since passage of the law? Our research suggests that Price has a strong case. Did Obama say the law would lower emergency room use? He certainly expressed hope that it would. He mentioned it during an address on health care to a joint session of Congress, and during a nationally televised town hall on health care on June 24, 2009. During the town hall, Obama said this: "One of the areas where we can potentially see some saving is -- a lot of those patients are being seen in the emergency room anyway, and if we are increasing prevention, if we are increasing wellness programs, we're reducing the amount of emergency room care, then that frees up doctors and resources to provide the kind of primary care that will keep people healthier, but also allow them to see more patients and hopefully give more time to patients, as well." Has emergency room use gone up since the law has gone into effect? Different pieces of data vary somewhat, but all in all, there’s strong evidence that emergency room usage hasn’t declined much, if at all, since the law largely took effect in 2013. There’s also evidence that it has increased. Here are some examples of studies that looked at this question. • May 2015: A survey of more than 2,000 emergency-room physicians by the American College of Emergency Physicians asked whether the volume of patients in their emergency room had dropped or risen after the law took effect. The results: 28 percent said it had "increased greatly" and 47 percent said it had "increased slightly." Combined, that means three-quarters of emergency room doctors saw an increase. • February 2016: A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at the change in emergency room use between 2013 (which was largely before the law) and 2014 (which was largely after the law took effect). "ER use overall has not changed significantly after the first full year of ACA implementation," the report concludes. • August 2016: A study in the journal Annals of Emergency Medicine looked at emergency room use in Illinois by adults between 2011 and 2015, separating out patterns of visits before and after the law took effect. The study found that emergency room visits in the state "increased after ACA health insurance expansion. ... A large post-ACA increase in Medicaid visits and a modest increase in privately insured visits outpaced a large reduction in (emergency room) visits by uninsured patients." So the studies pointed toward a modest increase in ER use. Two other recent studies looked at state-based scenarios that mirrored the types of expansions of coverage in Obama’s law. Both of them -- a March 2014 study of Massachusetts and an October 2016 study of Illinois -- found increased emergency room use after coverage was expanded. Why isn’t emergency room use going down? Experts cite a mix of reasons. Medicaid reimbursement rates are lower than those for private insurance, so appointments at doctors’ offices may be hard to obtain for those who received Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, "two-thirds of emergency visits occur on weekends and when doctors’ offices are closed," said Laura Gore, a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. Demographics may play a role, too. Senior citizens are growing as a percentage of the population, and older Americans are likelier to have chronic health problems that require an emergency room visit, Gore said. In fact, the trend of growing emergency room use predates the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. "Emergency department use has been rising since they were popularized after World War II," said Scott M. Dresden, a physician and assistant professor at Northwestern University who co-wrote the Illinois study. "Research on health services use since the 1970s has shown that providing patients with assistance for health care costs, such as insurance, leads to increased health services use. So it's not particularly surprising that providing patients with insurance didn't decrease emergency department use." But the biggest factor may be force of habit. "Old habits are hard to break," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "People who were used to seeking care in ERs may continue to go there for a while. When Kaiser first started taking Medicaid patients, many continued their use of the ER for routine care like they had always done. It took a while to wean them away." Katherine Baicker, a professor of health economics at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-author of the Oregon study, agreed. "Expanding health insurance coverage leads to greater use of care across many settings, including the doctor's office, the pharmacy, the hospital, and the emergency room," she said. "This is what one might expect from the basic economics: Medicaid took health care that was expensive and made it free, so people used more of it." Our ruling Price said the Obama administration said "they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of health care, and that is the emergency rooms. In fact, they did just the opposite." While the data varies a bit from study to study, the findings generally fail to provide any evidence that emergency room use has decreased after the law took effect. Indeed, several studies found increases in emergency room use, though modestly. Price overstated the case slightly, but he's basically correct. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11614	Says "566,000 crimes" were "made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2018/jan/25/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-airs-unsupported-claim-about-566000-cr/	Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, seeking re-election, entered 2018 by warning on his campaign’s Facebook page that "criminal aliens" committed more than 500,000 Texas crimes in recent years. We wondered about Patrick’s declaration in part because we’d just found scant data about Texas crimes committed by individuals living illegally in the United States. Also, research rooted in U.S. Census Bureau data suggests that nationally, unauthorized immigrants commit few crimes. For that other fact-check, we calculated from annual state-posted crime reports that the 170,000 arrests of "criminal immigrants" proclaimed by a Texas House member at a 2015 hearing represented about 4 percent of all the adult arrests in the state from 2011 through 2015. But absent expert analysis, we wouldn't brandish that percentage as a fact. Here’s Patrick’s statement on Facebook, which he presented against the backdrop of a wire fence: "566,000 crimes made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years." We took that to mean that "criminal aliens" were found guilty of 566,000 crimes over six years. Then again, text in smaller print to the right of Patrick’s fence-backdropped statement offers a different interpretation. That text says: "In the past six years, criminal aliens have been charged with more than 566,000 crimes in Texas including kidnapping, homicide, burglary, and much more. There is no excuse for endangering our communities by allowing criminal aliens who have committed a crime to go free." Some perspective: We estimate, starting from Texas Department of Public Safety annual crime reports for 2011 through 2016, that there were 5,513,663 adult criminal arrests in the state in the six-plus years referenced by Patrick. If the 566,000 figure offered by Patrick solely reflects arrests, he was referring to about 10 percent of adult arrests in the state. Patrick points to state-posted figures We asked Patrick, a Houston Republican who touts his support for a secure U.S.-Mexico border in a fresh video ad, about the basis of his 566,000 "crimes made" statement. A spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, replied by email: "We have answered this question many times." Garcia provided a link to a familiar DPS web page, "Historical Arrest and Conviction Data for Select Offenses Associated with Criminal Aliens:" SOURCE: Web page, "Historical Arrest and Conviction Data for Select Offenses Associated with Criminal Aliens," Texas Department of Public Safety, undated (accessed Jan. 23, 2018) Adding up the chart’s tallied arrests, covering 11 crime categories, gets you to 638,411 arrests "associated with criminal aliens." And did all those arrests occur in the six-plus years noted by Patrick on Facebook? Not so. A related DPS web page noted by Garcia, "Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data," says that according to Department of Homeland Security "status indicators, over 240,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017. During their criminal careers," it says, "these criminal aliens were charged with more than 638,000 criminal offenses." We read "criminal careers" to refer to the booked individuals’ lifetime rap sheets. More from the DPS page about those "career" arrests: "Those arrests include 1,300 homicide charges; 76,044 assault charges; 18,126 burglary charges; 76,660 drug charges; 774 kidnapping charges; 43,591 theft charges; 49,154 obstructing police charges; 4,180 robbery charges; 6,878 sexual assault charges; and 9,561 weapon charges." Unmentioned in that text: 352,143 of all the tallied arrests, 55 percent, were for "all other offenses," according to the DPS. According to DPS criminal history records, the agency says, those 638,000-plus criminal charges "have thus far resulted in over 286,000 convictions." The conviction count presented on the chart offered as Patrick’s backup indicates 286,101 convictions. The DPS page says the convictions break out to 547 homicide convictions; 28,592 assault convictions; 8,915 burglary convictions; 37,581 drug convictions; 268 kidnapping convictions; 19,803 theft convictions; 24,084 obstructing police convictions; 2,153 robbery convictions; 3,164 sexual assault convictions; and 3,973 weapon convictions." Its text on the web page doesn’t mention the 157,021 included convictions for other offenses accounting for 55 percent of the total convictions. We spotted a couple other wrinkles. DPS’s web page indirectly reminds that a "criminal alien" isn’t necessarily someone living in the country without documentation. "Of the total criminal aliens arrested in that timeframe," the page says, "over 160,000 or 66% were identified by DHS status as being in the U.S. illegally at the time of their last arrest." We noticed too that the DPS doesn’t specify how many of the noted arrests or convictions through criminal careers tie to the 160,000-plus people believed to be living here illegally at the time of their latest arrest. Our requests to the DPS to corroborate Patrick’s 566,000 figure didn’t yield additional information. Our ruling Patrick said that "566,000 crimes" were "made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years." We didn't find a factual path to this figure and, in fact, spotted no state-posted information specifying a relevant count of criminal arrests or convictions for the six-plus years singled out by Patrick. The DPS has said that more than 638,000 charges and over 286,000 convictions were accumulated through their "criminal careers" by more than 240,000 "criminal aliens" booked into Texas jails in the six-plus years. Unsaid: Some of those people were living in the U.S. with legal authorization. We find Patrick’s statement inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-00260	Says Sen. Richard Blumenthal "lied about his service" in Vietnam.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-sen-blumenthal-lied-about-his-service/	Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., brought Christine Blasey Ford to tears when he praised her courage at coming forward with her account of a sexual attack by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh more than 30 years ago. At a rally in Southaven, Miss., President Donald Trump went from disparaging Ford to denouncing Blumenthal. Trump dubbed Blumenthal "Da Nang Richard," a reference to a battleground in the Vietnam War. "This guy lied about his service," Trump said Oct. 2. Trump went on to embellish his attack on Blumenthal’s credibility, adding a couple of invented details that we rated False in a companion fact-check. But here, we focus on whether Blumenthal ever misled about his military service. By his own admission, he did. An election revelation As Blumenthal was running for U.S. Senate in 2010, the New York Times reported that on a couple of occasions, he had talked inaccurately about his Vietnam years. Blumenthal enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970. Until then, five deferments had kept him out of the war. Getting a coveted slot in the reserves reduced the chance of battlefield deployment. Blumenthal went through basic training and served six years in the Washington, D.C area and Connecticut. As Connecticut’s Attorney General, Blumenthal regularly attended Memorial Day parades and other events that recognized soldiers and veterans. The New York Times wrote May 17, 2010, that in 2003, Blumenthal had spoken at a rally supporting troops overseas. The newspaper reported that Blumenthal said, "When we returned, we saw nothing like this." That was a comparison with soldiers who came back from Vietnam. Blumenthal repeated a similar line at a 2007 Memorial Day parade in Milford, Conn. And at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens, Blumenthal said, "We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam." At the same event, he first said he served "during the Vietnam era." It was later in his remarks that he spoke of actually being there. So, at three public events, Blumenthal clearly placed himself in Vietnam. But at other times, his words reflected his actual resume. During a televised candidate forum March 1, 2010, two months before the New York Times article, Blumenthal distinguished between serving "during" and "in" the war. "Although I did not serve in Vietnam, I have seen first-hand the effects of military action," he said. Over the years, newspapers described his military service in different ways. In 2003, the Connecticut Post referred to Blumenthal as "a former Marine sergeant who served in Vietnam." The paper repeated that in a 2008 article, but in 2009, called him "a Marine sergeant during the Vietnam era." The New Haven Register wrote in 2007 of him as, "Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who served with the Marines in Vietnam." At the time, Blumenthal did not correct any of those descriptions. The apology A day after the New York Times story, Blumenthal held a news conference in West Hartford, Conn. "I routinely describe my pride at having served in the United States Marine Corps Reserves during the Vietnam era," Blumenthal said, flanked by veterans. "On a few occasions, I have misspoken about my service. And I regret that, and I take full responsibility." Blumenthal released a statement about a week later saying, "I have made mistakes and I am sorry." Our ruling Trump said Blumenthal lied about serving in Vietnam. On at least three occasions, Blumenthal did say things that placed him actually in Vietnam. At other times, he was more careful, saying he served "during" the war.

pomt-04987	On suspending system development charges for two years.	half flip	/oregon/statements/2012/jul/20/charlie-hales/hales-hasnt-completely-reversed-course-his-system-/	In a city as blue as Portland, it’s sometimes hard for mayoral candidates to draw sharp policy differences. Even so, a few emerge. Take for instance, Charlie Hales and Jefferson Smith’s difference over the very intriguing "system development charges." System development charges are fees paid by developers to help finance the infrastructure need to support their projects -- everything from roads and water to sewers and parks. During the primary campaign, Hales called for a two-year moratorium on the charges. They were a deterrent to new development, he said, at a time when the city needed all the economic activity it could get. (In a recent conversation he illustrated his point: A movie theater on Northwest 21st Avenue recently expanded and had to pay transportation development fees. But, he said, the transportation infrastructure up there is already strong -- what’s the point?) Jefferson Smith, for his part, disagreed, saying during an April debate: "I don’t agree with Mr. Hales that we should give a sweeping break to the developers to allow them to build that infill housing without paying for those very basics. So before we talk about spending new money, or even spending old money, let’s make sure we don’t give away the money we already have." In fact, PolitiFact Oregon at the time thought it was interesting enough that we did a short fact check on the issue. All of this might not matter anymore, however, given a recent story in The Willamette Week reporting that Hales has done a 180 on the issue. "He tells WW he’s backed away from his proposal to waive development fees across the board," the July 18 article reads. "He says his plan all along was to help jump-start affordable housing and small businesses, which often pay onerous fees when they open, expand or remodel." So, has Charlie Hales done a flip flop? We wanted to find out. The surest way to settle this was to call Hales directly. He said he had abandoned the idea of a two-year moratorium -- at least for now. That said, he’s still interested in having a discussion about the fees. The change of heart happened for a couple reasons, according to Hales. First, a report on these charges is due to be given to the City Council early next year, right after he’d assume office if he wins in November. Hales says he’s hoping the report will answer for him the questions "Are our STCs too high? Are they just right? Are they too low -- I suspect that is probably not the case." Second, Hales says he’s noticed more development in recent months -- pushing him to rethink whether a moratorium is necessary for spurring future growth. "A full moratorium doesn't appear to be needed anymore," he said, but he would consider a partial one, particularly to support smaller businesses. "There still may be some need." We also checked with Ross Caron, the spokesman for Portland’s Bureau of Development Services, who backed up Hales in part, noting that "development has been more active this summer than it has been for the last few years," for both commercial and residential projects. Of course, news of a development rebound has been around for some time now. Still, Hales’ motivation in changing his position is not the subject we’re interested so much as the change itself. We’re ruling his change of heart a Half Flip. At one point, Hales called for a full moratorium on system development charges. Now, he’s taking a wait-and-see approach with the idea that a partial, more-targeted moratorium might be necessary down the road.

pomt-07292	"We bring in enough tax revenue to service our debt, pay for Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, and then still have about $300 (billion) or $400 billion left over."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/20/amy-kremer/tea-party-express-amy-kremer-says-current-tax-reve/	During a May 17, 2011, interview on Comedy Central’s The Colbert Report, Tea Party Express chair Amy Kremer offered host Stephen Colbert this statistic about the federal budget: "We bring in enough tax revenue," she said, "to service our debt, pay for Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security and then still have about $300 (billion) or $400 billion left over." A reader asked us if we could fact-check this claim, so we did. We turned to President Barack Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal, which includes a statistical table called "Proposed Budget by Category." While this table primarily lists Obama’s proposed budget over the next 10 years, it also includes the past two fiscal years -- 2010 and 2011 -- with dollar figures broken down in each of the categories we need to analyze Kremer’s statement. Here’s what we found: Fiscal year 2010 Interest on the debt: $196 billion Medicare: $446 billion Medicaid: $273 billion Social Security: $701 billion Subtotal: $1.616 trillion Tax receipts: $2.041 trillion Receipts minus expenses above: $425 billion Fiscal year 2011 Interest on the debt: $207 billion Medicare: $488 billion Medicaid: $276 billion Social Security: $742 billion Subtotal: $1.713 trillion Tax receipts: $2.047 trillion Receipts minus expenses above: $334 billion So using either year’s figures, Kremer is very close to correct. But does her claim say anything meaningful about the federal budget? That’s less clear. Left unspoken by Kremer are several other important components of the federal budget. The remaining $334 billion for fiscal year 2011 would have to cover such expenses as these: Other mandatory programs: $716 billion Non-security discretionary spending: $507 billion Security discretionary spending (primarily defense and homeland security: $908 billion Total: $2.131 trillion. Now, it’s certainly possible to shrink these categories -- but getting down to $300 billion or $400 billion is not easy. "Other mandatory programs" include those that are not funded annually by Congress but instead receive funds according to a pre-set formula. These include federal civilian and military retirement benefits, food stamps, unemployment compensation and veterans benefits. It’s possible to rewrite formulas for these programs in a way that drastically shrinks or even eliminates them, but it would pose a major challenge, both legislatively and politically. The second category -- non-security discretionary spending -- is easier to cut in a practical sense, but even within this category are lots of expenditures that, while discretionary, aren’t easy to let go of, from food and drug safety to air traffic control. Finally, Kremer’s comparison devotes not a dime to either the military or homeland security. Even cutting the current amount in half -- a course that’s almost entirely impractical in the short term -- would exceed Kremer’s excess amount for 2011 by more than one-third. "Long before the country had Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security, it had an Army and Navy," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. "I think the omission of ‘national defense’ from Ms. Kremer’s list of essentials is a pretty important clarification." Rating Kremer’s statement is challenging, because what she said is undeniably true, but narrowly so, with missing factors that undercut her statement’s relevance. When we asked an ideologically diverse group of economists how useful they thought Kremer’s formulation was, their answers ranged widely. For instance, J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted that some of the excess costs that Kremer left out of the equation could be picked up by reining in factors she did include. "If we're going to play ‘what if,’ then you have to allow that she may have wanted to cut some of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to make room for other spending that was off the list," he said. Kremer deserves credit for doing the math correctly. However, her decision to ignore defense and homeland security spending -- to say nothing of mandatory programs like veterans benefits and safety-related discretionary spending -- makes the comparison of questionable value to a discussion of the nation’s budget problems. We rate her statement Half True.	None	Amy Kremer	None	None	None	2011-05-20T18:07:26	2011-05-17	['Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-09504	Says she "stopped Capital Metro from raising fares for senior and disabled citizens."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/21/margaret-gomez/gomez-says-she-stopped-capital-metro-raising-fares/	Margaret Gomez, a Democrat up for re-election as Travis County's Precinct 4 commissioner, has positioned herself as a candidate for the people. Lately, she's boasted about stopping Capital Metro, Austin's public transit authority, from increasing bus fares for seniors and people with disabilities. From a campaign flier distributed after the South Austin Democrats endorsed Gomez on Jan. 12: "Margaret Gomez has delivered results for Southeast Travis County... (she) stopped Capital Metro from raising fares for senior and disabled citizens." Gomez, a commissioner since 1995, served as the county's appointee to the board that oversees Capital Metro from 1997 through 2009 including a closing 19-month run as the board chair. Gomez's campaign pointed to the successful motion she made during a November board meeting to exempt seniors and people with disabilities from a bus and rail fare hike. The board voted 4-1 to increase the fare for a one-way bus ride to $1 and increase other discounted fares — like the 31-day adult bus pass — by more than 100 percent. The new fares kicked in Jan. 18. Thanks to the exemption initiated by Gomez, older and disabled riders continue to ride for free. Before the vote, Gomez had posted a statement posted on a pro-Democratic blog, the Burnt Orange Report: "I do not believe that we should balance the agency's budget on the backs of the elderly and disabled citizens, which is why I will ask the board to exempt seniors and disabled citizens from any fare increase." Yet Gomez wasn't always committed to sparing those riders from paying fares, as her record on the transit agency board shows. In May 2008 board members — including Gomez — twice voted unanimously in favor of a two-step fare increase plan that would have doubled the price of bus fare to $1 by 2011. Seniors and people whose disabilities weren't severe enough to qualify for the special door-to-door transit services required by federal law would have started paying 50-cent fares. The plan went to the Local Government Approval Committee, an ad hoc body of elected officials — Gomez not included — which amended the board's proposal and opted not to charge seniors and disabled citizens while it raised other Capital Metro fares that year.. In August 2009, Capital Metro staff members proposed to the board steeper fare increases that it wanted to kick in several months sooner than the original hikes were planned to go into effect, including charging 25 cents for single rides for seniors and people with disabilities. That's the proposal that was later amended, at Gomez's motion, to spare seniors and the disabled from the fare increase. So did Gomez get it right? Did she stop the fare increase? Sure she did, along with most fellow board members. She also earlier voted twice to advance plans subjecting seniors and the disabled to fare increases. But fares never raised for seniors and disabilities on her watch. We rate Gomez's claim Mostly True.	None	Margaret Gomez	None	None	None	2010-02-21T22:50:00	2010-02-15	['None']
pomt-06877	Says opponent David Dewhurst is a "career politician."	false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/31/tom-leppert/tom-leppert-says-david-dewhurst-career-politician/	Tom Leppert, the former Dallas mayor seeking to succeed U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, wasn’t impressed with Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst joining the race. "It comes as little surprise to me that David Dewhurst has thrown his hat into the ring. Like other career politicians, he has long expressed his interest in a host of higher offices," Leppert said in a statement issued July 19, the date Dewhurst posted his declaration video. We wondered how Leppert, a businessman who was mayor from June 2007 until his resignation in February, adjudged Dewhurst a career politician. Dewhurst, 65, won his first run for office, state land commissioner, in 1998. Four years later, he was elected lieutenant governor; he was re-elected in 2006 and 2010. The job pays $7,200 a year, though Dewhurst gets temporary bumps by assuming gubernatorial duties every time Gov. Rick Perry is out of state. So, he’s in his 13th year in office. But he had jobs before entering politics. After graduating from the University of Arizona, he served in the U.S. Air Force, the CIA and the State Department, according to the biography posted online by his campaign, then returned home to Houston in the 1980s to go into business. That worked out. In his 1998 campaign, Dewhurst revealed that his 1997 taxable income was $3.7 million, the Houston Chronicle reported. He has put millions of his own dollars into his campaigns. In April 2010, Dewhurst’s lieutenant governor campaign said he’d experienced a net loss of $1.34 million in 2008, while paying $565,000 in income tax, according to a statement quoted by the Austin American-Statesman. Leppert spokesman Shawn McCoy told us by email that Leppert was applying the "career politician" standard employed by Dewhurst in 1998 against his Democratic opponent, Richard Raymond. At the time, McCoy said, "Dewhurst repeatedly called Raymond a ‘career politician.’ Raymond had spent three terms (six years) in the Texas Legislature." "It would be comical for Dewhurst to claim that after spending the past 12 years in statewide elected office, including three terms as lieutenant governor, that he is not a career politician," McCoy said. McCoy also passed along newspaper stories from that year including a January 1998 San Antonio Express-News article quoting Dewhurst saying, "I am … the underdog against career politicians." At the time, he was poised to face then-state Sen. Jerry Patterson in the Republican primary. Mindful there’s no set definition for "career politician," we sought professorial perspective. Antonio Merlo, a University of Pennsylvania economist who once analyzed how many U.S. House members proved career politicians, told us in an interview that a fair definition is somebody who has been a politician most of their working life, often by advancing through different levels of governance. Merlo agreed the term is often tossed out as a pejorative even though, he said, there’s nothing inherently wrong with being a career politician: "Every job, you’re learning while doing. Politics is a full-time occupation. It’s very complex, especially if you want to do it at a high level." More significant, Merlo said, is whether an officeholder has been constructive or just there "because they’re lazy and they want to survive off the spoils." Merlo encouraged us to contact Princeton University political scientist Nolan McCarty, who had no objections to Merlo’s definition of a career politician. Of Dewhurst, McCarty said a dozen years in politics "for somebody that age doesn’t strike me as your typical career politician." In contrast, he said, a Dewhurst predecessor as lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, started in politics as a young man and was absolutely a career politician. Our take: Dewhurst may be into his second (or third or fourth) career. But he’s held office less than a third of his adult life. We rate Leppert’s statement False.

pomt-00031	Says that Andrew Gillum said, "Police and prisons have no place in justice."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/nov/06/ron-desantis/despite-desantis-anti-police-claims-gillums-record/	Republican Ron DeSantis and GOP groups have painted Democrat Andrew Gillum as anti-police. In an interview with Sean Hannity on Oct. 30, 2018, DeSantis doubled down on his claim that Gillum is anti-law enforcement. "There is no doubt that there's corruption in Tallahassee," DeSantis said. "It is one of the most corrupt cities in Florida. It also has the highest crime rate in Florida. And this is a guy who has taken a pledge attacking our men and women in law enforcement. He will not standby them." A few moments later, Hannity said he had read that Gillum was "not a big fan of police." DeSantis responded, "He said police and prisons have no place in justice. It’s outrageous." Gillum is the Democratic candidate for Florida governor and the mayor of Tallahassee. He’s up against DeSantis, a former congressman backed by President Donald Trump. We’ve looked at DeSantis’ and Gillum’s claims about Tallahassee’s crime rate as well as attacks on Gillum about an FBI probe. Gillum never said that "police and prisons have no place in justice." When we asked the DeSantis campaign what their evidence was, they pointed to Gillum’s relationship with the group Dream Defenders. We'll explain the connection, but Gillum never said those words. The pledge DeSantis often zeroes in on the social justice group Dream Defenders, a group that has raised concerns about racial profiling since the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, the young unarmed African-American teenager shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. Gillum’s support for the Dream Defenders goes back to the group’s formation, although both the Dream Defenders and Gillum have said they do not share the entirety of each other’s platforms. A Gillum spokesman told the Miami Herald in late September that the Dream Defenders were leaders for the struggle for social justice in Florida, but that Gillum did not agree with several of the group’s positions. Dream Defenders spokeswoman Nailah Summers agreed, telling the Herald that the Dream Defenders were "more left-leaning" than Gillum and that they disagreed on topics including the role of police and prisons, the functionality of borders and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. When DeSantis said Gillum signed a pledge attacking law enforcement, he was referring to the Freedom Papers elected officials pledge. This pledge is a two-page document that calls on those who sign it to pledge not to take a penny from the NRA or the Geo Group, a private prison operator. "I will fight for a Florida that divests from prisons, detention centers, guns and police and invests in the basic needs and safety of its people, especially its children," the pledge stated. "I will fight for a reallocation of our state budget from police and prisons to good food, affordable housing, quality health care and public education." Gillum signed the pledge in June 2018, along with the three other Democratic gubernatorial candidates at the time, according to Dream Defenders spokeswoman Nailah Summers. The candidates signed the pledge following a debate co-hosted by the Dream Defenders. Summers said 30 Florida politicians have signed the pledge. The Freedom Papers elected officials pledge is a different document than the Freedom Papers, a longer document that outlines the Dream Defenders’ views in more detail. However, the two-page elected officials pledge contains the line, "I pledge my support to the Freedom Papers." The Freedom Papers is a 20-page document that makes a series of statements about social and economic issues, particularly those that affect poor people, minorities and immigrants. The papers raise concerns about underpaid teachers, income inequality, rent hikes and calls for open elections and an end to violence. The Freedom Papers document includes a few paragraphs that are highly critical of police and prisons, stretching back to the days when police helped catch escaped slaves. "Police and prisons have no place in 'justice,' " this longer document stated. "Police and prisons aren’t just racist but they work to enforce the separations of rich and poor. True safety can’t be found where it was never meant to." The papers also state that prisons separate rich from poor. "We deserve real safety over our cities, our states, our homes, our schools, our workplaces, and our community centers," the pledge stated. Gillum’s relationship with police as mayor Gillum has called for criminal justice reform, but his record shows that he wants to work with law enforcement. In a 2014 Tallahassee Democrat op-ed, Gillum talked about a ride-along he went on with Tallahassee police and implored community members to support them. "For the sake of my children and yours, I hope you will join me in supporting our law-enforcement officers and investing your time and talents for the betterment of our community," Gillum wrote at the time. During Gillum’s tenure as mayor, Tallahassee added more than 50 police officer positions. Tallahassee started several law enforcement-related programs focused on fostering relationships between community members and police and on improving recidivism rates while Gillum was mayor and earlier while he was a city commissioner. Our ruling Gillum did sign the Dream Defenders elected officials pledge, but we could find no evidence of him saying "police and prisons have no place in justice." That’s a line from the Dream Defenders’ longer document, the Freedom Papers. The pledge Gillum signed focuses on divesting from prisons, guns and police and putting money into safety and education. Signees also agree not to take money from the NRA or a private prison group. The longer document, the Freedom Papers, expands on the Dream Defenders’ views with 20-pages of statements about a range of social and economic issues. The two-page elected officials pledge contains the line, "I pledge my support to the Freedom Papers." However, Gillum and the Dream Defenders maintain that they do not see eye-to-eye on several issues and that the Dream Defenders are "more left-leaning" than Gillum.

pomt-00790	Under Barack Obama, "the average cost of family health care premiums has increased by $4,154."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/07/scott-walker/scott-walker-sees-big-rise-health-insurance-premiu/	As he explores a run for the White House, Gov Scott Walker has readily criticized President Barack Obama, a favorite punching bag for Republicans seeking to succeed him. On March 23, 2015, Walker turned to Twitter to complain about the rise in health insurance premiums since Obama took office. Using a couple of abbreviations, he tweeted: "Did you know that under Obama the avg cost of family HC premiums has increased by $4,154?" We’ll look at the figure, as well as the implication that premium increases have been inordinately high since Obama took office. The figures, and the context Walker’s tweet included a link to a September 2014 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source on health care. The report was about the foundation’s annual survey of private and non-federal public employers on the costs of employer-sponsored health benefits. The survey was done from January through May of 2014. Kaiser found that the average annual premium for family coverage was $16,834 in 2014. In Kaiser’s 2008 survey, the average was $12,680. So, the average increased by $4,154 -- the amount Walker claimed. But the earlier survey was done from January through May of 2008, when Republican George W. Bush was still president. Obama didn’t take office until January 2009. That makes it a bad starting point to use. In 2009, the average annual premium for family coverage was $13,375, according to Kaiser’s 2009 survey, which also was done in the January-May timeframe. That means the increase since Obama took office, from 2009 to 2014, was $3,459, not the $4,154 that Walker claimed. As for context for the figures, Kaiser found that from 2009 to 2014, the average family premium rose by 26 percent -- which it called "significantly lower" than the 34 percent growth in the previous five-year period, from 2004 to 2009. A final note: Two months before Walker made his claim, U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., made the same claim, also in a tweet and citing the same Kaiser report. PolitiFact Virginia rated her claim, Mostly False. That fits here. Our rating Walker said that under Obama, "the average cost of family health care premiums has increased by $4,154." The figure is correct when comparing 2008 to 2014 and using figures from a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source on health care. But that includes a period before Obama took office in January 2009. The increase is less -- $3,459 -- when comparing 2009 to 2014. Moreover, despite the implication in Walker’s statement, the increase in average family premiums from 2009 to 2014 is less than it was the previous five years. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly False. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-04-07T11:05:20	2015-03-23	['None']
pomt-04234	Says about 25 Texas cities and 39 states have banned texting while driving.	true	/texas/statements/2012/nov/21/tom-craddick/tom-craddick-says-39-states-and-about-25-texas-cit/	Pitching a statewide ban on texting while driving like one vetoed by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011, a former speaker of the Texas House said two dozen Texas cities and most states already bar the practice. Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland, said in a Nov. 12, 2012, press release: "Approximately 25 Texas cities have adopted an ordinance banning texting while driving." He also said: "It is time for Texas to join the other 39 states" in banning "this dangerous behavior for all drivers." Craddick’s House Bill 63 would bar the use of a wireless communication device to read, write or send a text-based communication while driving, except when a vehicle is stopped. The ban would not apply to hands-free devices or to dialing a number or using the GPS on a hand-held phone. Perry’s June 17, 2011, message accompanying his veto of Craddick’s previous proposal said that texting while driving is reckless and irresponsible, but the proposed change in law amounts to a "government effort to micromanage the behavior of adults." Perry said the keys to "dissuading drivers of all ages from texting while driving are information and education." Nationally, according to a web post by the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 220 million people subscribe to wireless services and up to 80 percent of those subscribers use their phones while driving. Further, distracted driving including cell phone use figured into 16 percent of fatal U.S. crashes in 2009, up from 10 percent in 2005, as noted in a June 2011 Truth-O-Meter article. We won’t judge here whether restrictions on cell phone use affect accident rates. But is Craddick correct that 39 states and about 25 Texas cities now bar texting while driving? To our inquiry, Kate Huddleston of Craddick’s office forwarded an email from Julian Hoffman of the National Safety Council stating that 39 states ban texting while driving. By email, Hoffman told us the council drew its count from information posted online with a map of the United States by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which describes itself as an effort funded by auto insurers dedicated to reducing deaths, injuries and property damage related to highway and roadway crashes. An introduction to the institute’s map of states with limits on texting while driving, dated November 2012, says: "Text messaging is banned for all drivers in 39 states and the District of Columbia." The map indicates that six additional states, including Texas, have imposed partial bans. In Texas, an institute chart says, individuals barred from texting include drivers in school crossing zones; bus drivers when a passenger 17 or younger is present; and drivers younger than 18. States lacking any such restrictions are Montana, Arizona, South Dakota, South Carolina and Florida, according to the map. We asked the institute how it determined the states with such laws. Spokesman Russ Rader told us by phone: "We track state laws. That’s part of what we do." Rader also sent a chart showing the date each state’s texting-while-driving ban took effect. Among the states, Connecticut had the first law, in 2005. The year 2010 had the highest count of any year with restrictions taking effect in 14 states. From January through August 2012, most recently, bans took effect in six states--Nevada, Pennsylvania, Idaho, West Virginia, Alabama and Ohio. Similarly, the National Conference of State Legislatures says 39 states have banned texting while driving. Anne Teigen, a conference policy specialist, told us by phone that the group independently confirmed each state’s ban. Next, we hunted breakdowns of the Texas cities that have banned texting while driving. According to a February 2012 report by the non-partisan House Research Organization, which analyzes legislative issues for the Texas House, Austin was the state’s first city to do so, in November 2009. In total, the report says, at least 23 Texas cities approved bans. Besides Austin, cities listed as having bans are: Alamo, Arlington, Bellaire, Brownsville, Conroe, El Paso (which bans motorists from using any hand-held devices), Galveston, Harlingen, Magnolia, McAllen, Mission, Missouri City, Mount Vernon, Nacogdoches, Palmview, Penitas, San Antonio, Shoreacres, Stephenville, Tomball, Universal City and West University Place. By telephone, Laura Hendrickson, the research group’s director, told us its researcher compiled the list. Amarillo, described in the report as weighing a ban, later banned the use of hand-held phones while driving, according to a Nov. 12, 2012, news article in the Amarillo Globe-News. Separately, Craddick’s office forwarded an email from the Texas Department of Transportation listing the same cities plus Canyon. TxDOT spokeswoman Veronica Beyer told us by phone its list originated with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute whose spokesman, Bernie Fette, emailed that it was built from online news sources checked during August and September 2012. Our ruling Craddick said 39 states and about 25 Texas cities have banned texting while driving. That’s correct, making his statement True.

pomt-12744	"Top Democrats refuse to stand for Gold Star widow."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/01/blog-posting/reports-falsely-accuse-democrats-refusing-stand-go/	Conservative blogs accused Democrats of sitting through an ovation for the widow a slain Navy SEAL during President Donald Trump’s first address to Congress, but video shows a different story. In his speech, Trump thanked Carryn Owens, who was married to William "Ryan" Owens, the SEAL killed in a Jan. 29, 2017, raid in Yemen. The mention drew the crowd to their feet for extended applause, lasting more than two minutes. But some outlets focused on what they saw as disrespect from Democrats. "Horrible! Top Democrats refuse to stand for Gold Star widow," read the headline on a March 1, 2017, post on 100PercentFedUp.com. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A photo showed U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, and Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the current deputy chairman of the DNC, seated together. (Snopes determined the image was taken more than a half an hour prior to the ovation.) Another post from DailyWire.com read, "Awful: Top Democrats refuse to stand, clap for Navy SEAL widow honored by Trump." That post originally showed the same photo of Wasserman Schultz and Ellison but was later changed after we inquired about it. The post also excoriated House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont by name. The post did say that "Democrats initially stood for the widow," but the headline suggests otherwise. TheBlaze.com said the incident was "truly disgusting." Other posts focused on Twitter outrage over the incident. State GOP organizations piled on. Even Florida Sen. Marco Rubio mentioned the incident the morning after the speech on Fox & Friends. "I turned back around my shoulder and I see half the room, most of them sitting down, I was just shocked by that," Rubio said. "I noticed as soon as the speech was done they got up and walked out." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The show alluded to the incident with a chyron that read, "Dems sat during POTUS tribute to SEAL’s widow." Democrats weren’t too thrilled with Trump’s speech, to be sure. But upon reviewing recordings of the speech, there’s ample evidence that Democrats did stand — just not as long as their Republican counterparts. And that’s a fairly typical thing for the opposition party to do, an expert told us. Tale of the tape Ryan Owens was the first American combatant killed during the Trump administration. Critics have questioned whether the raid in which he was killed should have been approved, and Owens’ father refused to meet with Trump. More recently, Trump been criticized for appearing to assign the blame to the military. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Here’s a breakdown of what happens in the video. Video time stamp (approx.) What’s happening The scene 0:30 Trump says, "We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William "Ryan" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero — battling against terrorism and securing our nation." Both sides of the aisle stand to acknowledge Owens. In the lower lefthand corner of the video you can see Ellison and Wasserman Schultz standing. Sanders is seen standing a few rows closer to the front. 0:45 Republicans and Democrats sit down and Trump continues. 1:20 Trump says, "I just spoke to our great Gen. Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ‘Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.’ Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity." People in the chamber rise and applaud. The video shows Carryn Owens in the gallery. 1:50 The camera pans away to show Democrats and Republicans both standing. Some Democrats begin to take their seats. We can see Pelosi standing, but it appears Wasserman Schultz, Ellison and Sanders are seated. 2:00 A wide shot shows that many Democrats have sat down. Republicans remain standing. 2:20 Most Democrats are seated, but it appears some are still clapping, and some are standing. 2:55 Applause ends and entire chamber sits down. This video from NBC shows some different angles, including a wide, panning shot showing Democrats seated while Republicans cheer. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com That image was used on some blogs to "prove" Democrats didn’t stand, but it’s actually about 2 minutes and 45 seconds into the NBC video. Breaches of etiquette do happen during speeches before Congress — U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., shouted "You lie!" during a 2009 speech by President Barack Obama. "Republicans often sat stone-faced during Obama's State of the Union addresses. Democrats laughed derisively when Reagan promised to balance the budget," said Craig Smith, a former speechwriter for Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush and director emeritus of the Center for First Amendment Studies at California State University, Long Beach. Smith said Trump’s tribute to the Navy SEAL was a "moment unmatched since Reagan paid tribute to Lenny Skutnick, who actually was in the gallery. And that began the tradition." Skutnik was a former Congressional Budget Office employee who helped rescue a plane crash survivor from the Potomac River in January 1982. Reagan recognized him days later in his State of the Union speech, which is considered the first time the practice of noting an ordinary citizen became routine. Our ruling Bloggers said, "Top Democrats refuse to stand for Gold Star widow." That makes it sound as if the blue side of the aisle stubbornly stayed seated while the GOP cheered for the widow of a Navy SEAL killed in a raid in Yemen. A more accurate headline would be, "Top Democrats don’t stand as long as Republicans for Gold Star widow." A video review shows Democrats including Sanders, Pelosi, Wasserman Schultz and Ellison stood. But most sat down while Republicans renewed their applause. To say they outright refused to stand up is inaccurate. We rate these headlines False. See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-03-01T17:41:38	2017-03-01	['None']
pomt-09236	Greece "has a GDP the size of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/12/george-will/will-says-greeces-economy-same-size-dallas-fort-wo/	During the May 9, 2010 edition of ABC's This Week, commentator George Will sought to add some context to one of the previous week's biggest stories -- the financial troubles in Greece, which prompted a bailout by its European neighbors that drew protests in Athens and shook financial markets across the world. This Week host Jake Tapper introduced the topic by asking Will, "Why should the American people care about this?" Will responded, "Because it's an early heart attack that ought to alert us to the fact that we could have a bigger heart attack. Greece is not too big to fail -- it has a GDP the size of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. It's too connected." We wondered whether the Dallas-Fort Worth's gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services produced -- could really be larger than that of an entire European nation. According to the World Bank, Greece's gross domestic product in 2008 was $355 billion, ranking it 26th in the world. Meanwhile, statistics calculated for the same year by the U.S. government's Bureau of Economic Analysis determined that the metro area consisting of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington, Texas, had a gross domestic product of $379 billion -- close enough in our view to make Will's statement correct. Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington actually ranked sixth among highest-GDP metro areas in the United States. Will could have just as easily pointed to five other metro areas that have bigger GDPs than Greece -- the ones based (in ascending order) in Washington, D.C., Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. New York City's economy, in fact, was about three and a half times the size of Greece's in 2008. Just to be sure, we also compared statistics for GDP adjusted by "purchasing power parity" -- a tweak that eliminates distortions based on the relative value of currencies and the local costs of commodities. The adjusted GDP for Greece is $330 billion, which is smaller than Greece's unadjusted GDP, but only by a modest amount. (The adjusted GDP uses the U.S. as its yardstick for comparison, so its GDP number does not change.) All in all, we rate Will's comment True.

pomt-07057	"On the day of the New Hampshire primary in 1980, the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan’s staff quit."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/29/newt-gingrich/gingrich-cites-reagan-bid-say-he-can-win-presidenc/	Newt Gingrich took to summoning the memory of President Ronald Reagan recently to convince supporters he still has a shot at the presidency. The Republican candidate spoke at the Atlanta Press Club on June 22, the morning after news broke that two of his top fundraisers had quit, and days after a mass exodus of high-level campaign staffers. They said his campaign was spending money it did not have, and Gingrich wasn’t doing enough to repair damage from a gaffe he made on Medicare. His luxury vacation to Greece made him look uncommitted and out of touch, they complained. The former U.S. House speaker told a wall of TV news cameras that he was there to talk about economic policy; he would not take questions about his campaign. But he did address its turmoil, albeit briefly. "Campaigns go up and down," Gingrich said, and he offered a tidbit of political history. "On the day of the New Hampshire primary in 1980, the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan’s staff quit," Gingrich said. Did they? To test Gingrich’s claim, we turned to some experts on our nation’s 40th president, as well as books that chronicle Reagan’s successful 1980 campaign. Yes, there was a mass exodus from the Reagan campaign. It began about 2 p.m. Feb. 26, 1980, the day he won the New Hampshire primary by a landslide. Reagan’s campaign manager at the time was John Sears. Some critics blamed Sears for losing the Iowa caucuses. Others thought he was too moderate, or that he was spending too much campaign money. Reagan resented that the press saw him as Sears’ puppet. Reagan decided to clean house. On the afternoon of the New Hampshire primary, he met with Sears, press secretary Jim Lake, and national political director Charlie Black in his hotel suite at the Holiday Inn. Reagan told Sears he planned to make some changes and handed him a piece of paper. It was a press release announcing Sears had resigned from the campaign to return to his law practice. Sears got the hint. He, Black and Lake left the campaign. That evening, as the Reagans celebrated their blowout victory, staffers loyal to the three departing aides packed up. Craig Shirley’s "Rendezvous With Destiny: Ronald Reagan and the Campaign That Changed America" contains the most detailed account we could find of the departures. (Shirley, who has worked for prominent Republican politicians, is writing a book on Gingrich’s early years.) Top assistants for Sears and Lake quit, the book said. Black’s assistant assumed she was fired and left with them. Twelve additional members of the Reagan campaign resigned in protest. Afterward, Reagan’s new campaign manager William Casey, future head of the Central Intelligence Agency, fired about half of the campaign’s 275 or so staffers. Things get fuzzy from here. It’s not entirely accurate to say these staffers "quit," as Gingrich said. Reagan told The Washington Post that he "wouldn’t call it a firing," but Sears held a news conference and said he was fired and not offered another job. It’s fair to say that at the very least, Sears was pushed out. Confirming the number of Reagan’s staffers who left is also a bit complicated. Shirley’s account mentions 18 of them. A Washington Post account published the day after the firings said that "by nightfall, a total of seven campaign aides had joined the exodus." That same day, The New York Times said "other high-ranking campaign aides . . . were expected to resign soon." Gil Troy, author of "Morning in America," a study of Reagan’s presidency, told PolitiFact Georgia in an email that "it is very plausible they [the resignations] reached thirteen that first day -- and almost tenfold within days." Here’s another hitch. Sears, Lake and Black were clearly among Reagan’s top aides, but whether those who left were "the top 13 people of Ronald Reagan’s staff" is debatable. Reagan’s "top people" included Sears’ replacement Casey and others who replaced them. In conclusion, Gingrich’s reference to the Reagan campaign isn’t perfect. It’s not entirely correct to say Reagan’s top three staffers quit. Sears said they were fired, and at the very least, they were pressured to leave. Gingrich’s count of 13 Reagan staffers is debatable, as is his description of them as "the top" aides. But Gingrich’s main point stands. There was a mass departure from the Reagan campaign. It began on the day of the 1980 New Hampshire primary. It included Reagan’s campaign manager Sears and other key members of the operation. We therefore rate Gingrich’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-15115	Says Donald Trump "wants to replace" Obamacare "with a single-payer system."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/11/reid-ribble/donald-trump-wants-replace-obamacare-single-payer-/	As the Summer of Trump wore on, a quiet congressman from Wisconsin decided he'd had enough of his party's ostentatious presidential frontrunner. Reid Ribble, a Republican from the Green Bay area, went public not only to blast Donald Trump's name calling -- particularly Trump’s calling Fox News talk show host Megyn Kelly a "bimbo" -- but to call him out as not being a conservative. In one interview, Ribble made several claims about Trump's non-conservatism to Milwaukee conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. One was about a so-called single-payer health care system, in which the government pays for care for all citizens. "The interesting this is, I'm not the guy who's saying we should have completely socialized medicine," Ribble said Sept. 8, 2015 on WTMJ-AM (620). "I want to repeal Obamacare and replace it with (a) free-market system. He wants to replace it with a single-payer system. That's hardly a conservative posture." Sometimes Trump's positions can seem to be a moving target; and whether they are conservative can be open to interpretation. But does Trump want to install a single-payer health care system? Twice in the past two months our colleagues have reviewed claims similar to Ribble's. So let's start there. First True In July 2015, conservative columnist Erick Erickson wrote that Trump "has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system." Our partners at PunditFact.com issued a rating of True. In 1999, during his short-lived 2000 Reform Party presidential bid, Trump told CNN's Larry King: "If you can’t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it’s all over. ... I believe in universal healthcare." And in his 2000 book "The America We Deserve," Trump made a strong pitch for universal health care. As to how the country might achieve universal coverage, Trump focused on a Canadian-style, single-payer plan. So, Trump has supported single payer in the past. Then Half True On Aug. 2, 2015, GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, said Trump is "for single-payer" -- essentially a present-tense version of the columnist’s claim. Our colleagues found that earlier in 2015, Trump voiced admiration for Scotland’s health care system, which is single payer. But in another interview -- while stopping short of rejecting single payer -- he talked about offering private plans made through "deals with hospitals" that allow the government to help people "at the lower levels." A spokesperson for Trump insisted at the time that Trump has "never supported socialized medicine," but is for "a universal ‘market-based’ plan that would offer a range of choices." So as the 2016 campaign unfolded, Trump has said he admires single payer, but also suggested he prefers free-market models, as well. PolitiFact National’s rating of Perry’s claim was Half True. The two fact checks were what Ribble’s office cited to us to back Ribble’s claim. (Trump’s campaign didn’t reply to us.) But Trump has since had more to say on the subject. Then what? Two days after the more recent fact check, Trump was asked on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" talk show: "Are you for single-payer health care?" Trump replied: "No, but it’s certainly something that in certain countries works. It actually works incredibly well in Scotland. Some people think it really works in Canada. But not here, I don’t think it would work as well here. What has to happen -- I like the concept of private enterprise coming in ….You have to create competition. And you have to go back to a system of private." The no part of Trump’s answer, even as he repeated praise for single payer, seemed to indicate Trump does not favor it for the United States. But he has since been less clear. Two days later, at the first Republican presidential debate on April 6, 2015, Fox News host Bret Baier asked Trump: "Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system. Why were you for that then and why aren’t you for it now?" Trump answered first by speaking about foreign policy, then said: "As far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you’re talking about here. "What I’d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state …..Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can’t take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system." Again, a mixed bag: praising single payer, but advocating, if vaguely, for a private system. More recently, Trump essentially gave no answer when conservative talk show host Sean Hannity asked him about single payer on Hannity’s Sept. 1, 2015 radio program. After covering other topics, Trump replied by saying: "As far as single-payer and all — there’s so many different things you could have. Honestly, Sean, to do, to have great health insurance. The one thing I do tell people, we’re going to have something great. We’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total disaster." Our rating Ribble said Trump "wants to replace" Obamacare "with a single-payer system." Trump continues to praise single payer -- a health care system in which the government pays for care for all citizens -- at least as it used in other countries. But he has spoken a number of times, if vaguely, about a private system and at one point said he does not support single payer in the United States. Since then, his responses have been less clear. We rate Ribble’s statement Half True.	None	Reid Ribble	None	None	None	2015-09-11T07:24:42	2015-09-08	['None']
pomt-03452	The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. "cannot account for creating one single job."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/20/chris-larson/sen-chris-larson-says-wisconsin-agency-cant-accoun/	Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature created the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. to lead the way on job creation. The agency -- a privatized version of the old state Commerce Department -- is nearing the two year mark. And, according to state Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), there’s not much to show for the effort. Appearing May 19, 2013 on "Upfront with Mike Gousha,"Larson said the agency was a mismanaged mess. "What we've done with WEDC is created an agency that has taken the worst of government, the worst of corporate, private enterprise and combined them, where they are spending tens of million of dollars, allocating it to whomever they see fit without legislative oversight," he said. "And the rare glimpses we get, show there's huge problems over there." Larson added: "I think the stunning thing about this, Mike, is that they cannot account for creating one single job over their two years of existence." Not one? When we asked Larson to elaborate, he referred us to WEDC’s annual reportand a May 2013 Legislative Audit Bureau’s report on the agency. "The Legislative Audit Bureau pointed out that they cannot count and accurately say that they have created a single job," Larson said, adding that WEDC officials will "say that they created a whole bunch of jobs" This path is a familiar one, though the last time we walked it from a different direction. We rated Half True a statement from state Rep. John Nygren (R-Marinette) who called WEDC a "proven job creator." The audit found record-keeping is lacking, but employers in Nygren’s northeastern Wisconsin district said that they added jobs after receiving tax credits and other assistance from the agency. Here’s what each report cited by Larson says: WEDC report: The report covers the first year of the agency. When it comes to measuring effectiveness, it looks to the future. "A total of 23,759 jobs in Wisconsin are anticipated to be impacted directly by investments made by WEDC in FY12," the report says. That means the agency expects that number of people will be hired in the future by companies that have received assistance. In all, WEDC made 287 "awards" worth $500 million to state employers in the first year of operation, the report said. Legislative Audit Bureau:The bureau’s reportsaid the agency had poor record keeping, sloppy internal practices and gave awards to ineligible businesses and projects. Additionally, it noted WEDC has experienced severe staffing turnover, including with top leadership. The audit said record-keeping was so sloppy, they were unable to include a job count in their review: "The report WEDC submitted in November 2012 did not contain all required information, contained some inaccurate information, and did not clearly present information about the number of jobs created and retained as a result of its programs. For these reasons, and in the absence of verified performance information, we did not assess the effectiveness of WEDC’s economic development programs." But there is a difference in calculating an accurate total number of jobs and -- as Larson claimed -- not being able to account for a single one. What’s more, there are the accounting standards applied in by auditors, and there is the understanding most would be left with after hearing Larson’s remark: That WEDC has nothing to show for its work. In reviewing the Nygren claim, we looked at several companies in his district that said they added workers after receiving tax credits and other help from WEDC. Those three companies -- Precision Ice Blasting Corp., Vargo Tool & Die Corp. and Marinette Marine, say they added a total of 1,022 jobs of a promised a total of 1,076 in exchange for $28.46 million in tax credits.Under the agreements, they don’t get the credits unless they can show the jobs were created. So, it’s clear that WEDC has provided tax credits and helped companies win additional work and hire more people. It’s just not clear what the overall score card actually reads. Our rating Larson said the state’s signature jobs agency "cannot account for creating one single job." Larson’s correct in that the agency, or a critical audit, can’t quantify its effectiveness. But Larson’s statement suggests no businesses have been assisted by WEDC. And there’s plenty of evidence that’s not the case, starting with the employers in northeastern Wisconsin. Our definition for Mostly False is: "The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That fits here.

pomt-05597	"Every time the weight of that vehicle is reduced by a hundred pounds, your chances of dying are going to go up by about 5 percent. Peel three hundred pounds off – you’re 15 percent more likely to die in that car."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/29/lars-larson/are-you-15-percent-more-likely-die-car-s-300-pound/	Talk-radio host Lars Larson went after President Barack Obama in a news post recently, claiming that the White House’s attempts to increase vehicle fuel mileage will end up killing some of us. The post is tantalizingly called, "Obama is going to kill some of you." How will that happen? Well, Larson says, the auto industry will do whatever it takes to stay in business, including making cars "very, very small." This is how Larson explains it: "They’re going to peel hundreds and hundreds of pounds of weight off the cars that you drive to achieve the government ordered corporate average fuel economy, even though America is sitting on an ocean of available oil. Every time the weight of that vehicle is reduced by a hundred pounds, your chances of dying are going to go up by about 5 percent. Peel three hundred pounds off – you’re 15 percent more likely to die in that car." We need to back up here. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, regulations are intended to improve the fuel economy of vehicles so we don’t guzzle so much oil. Obama announced last year a goal of an average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. The fleet average today is about 27 miles per gallon. Conservatives tend to argue that automakers will respond by making cars lighter and, therefore, more dangerous. But it’s important to note that the regulations set different goals for vehicles based on type. In other words, large sports utility vehicles don’t have to meet the same mileage goal as compact cars. That’s the backdrop. We turned to Larson. He cited a 2003 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which found that a 100-pound reduction in smaller cars resulted in a 4.39 percent increase in fatalities. The study looked at fatality data from 1995 to 2000, involving 1991 to 1999 model vehicles. Let us emphasize, the statistic applied only to vehicles weighing less than 2,950 pounds -- not all vehicles. For larger vehicles, the increase was about 2 percent. (What’s a car in the higher-risk category? A 1995 Honda Accord LX is about 2,900 lbs.) So the statistic exists, but we wondered: Surely vehicles have come a long way since 1999? We turned to a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, who forwarded us an updated version of the 2003 study with new numbers. And guess what? The 2011 study shows that for lighter cars weighing less than 3,106 lbs, the chances of dying go up 1.44 percent for every 100-pound reduction, if you maintain the same vehicle size or "footprint" as they call it. That’s a much smaller difference. Tom Wenzel is a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who also studies vehicle size, weight and fatality statistics. He explained the differences in the two studies. One, he said, the 2003 study assumed weight reduction would be accompanied by size reduction, but that’s not necessarily the case. Two, he said, vehicles have quite simply changed in the last decade, to become safer without the added weight. The later study looked at vehicles made between 2000 and 2007. The 4.39 percent figure is one statistic at one point in time, Wenzel said. Tweak the factors that go into the model to get that figure and the numbers change. NHTSA acknowledges the variety of opinions. At a one-day workshop on the topic of mass, size and safety the agency’s deputy administrator said that researchers have come to different conclusions: "Some associated a significant fatality increase with mass reductions, while others associated a fatality decrease with mass reduction." Finally, we checked with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Spokesman Russ Rader generally agrees that larger is safer. "All cars are much safer than they used to be, but the laws of physics haven’t been repealed," he said. "So the differences are still there: that is, people riding in small, lightweight cars get less protection in crashes than people in bigger, heavier ones." He pointed to a 2010 analysis of driver death rates per million showing that mini-cars, like the Honda Fit, had a death rate of 70 per million registered vehicles of that size. That’s double the rate for very large cars, 32 per million. And, sure, that makes sense. But, we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out in the same chart that midsize cars, like the Honda Accord, had a death rate of 37 per million -- which is close to the largest cars. (Rader’s response? Midsize cars do a good job, too.) We wanted to give a variety of sources and opinions, but we have a ruling to make. Larson cited a study figure that was largely accurate in 2003, but only as applied to vehicles under a certain weight. And those numbers have been updated by the original researcher to reflect a much smaller increase that is significantly different from Larson’s statement. Larson argues that his statement is accurate. His point remains that increasing fuel mileage -- from the mid-20s to 55 miles per gallon by 2025 -- will have to come from reducing weight and technical advancements, but he thinks it’s more of the former rather than the latter. "Reducing weight degrades safety. I told the listener that it makes death or injury more likely," he wrote in an email. Researchers and others in the industry are somewhat divided on how much weight to give weight in calculating safety, but they acknowledge that Obama is not demanding that all of us start driving Honda Fits. We apologize for picking on Hondas. We don’t apologize for our ruling. We rate the statement Mostly False. It contains a nugget of truth -- it came from a 2003 report -- but the number is out of date and narrow to boot.	None	Lars Larson	None	None	None	2012-03-29T16:50:43	2012-03-20	['None']
pomt-13613	In Hillary Clinton's tax returns, "you saw a lot of income coming from donors to the Clinton Foundation and people who benefitted from her State Department term as well."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/14/paul-manafort/paul-manafort-says-clintons-tax-returns-show-incom/	Hillary Clinton’s release of her 2015 tax returns last week renewed calls for Donald Trump to do the same, but it also provided the Trump campaign fodder for attack. CNN State of the Union host Jake Tapper asked Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort why Trump has yet to release his tax returns, especially since his lawyers have said Trump’s 2008 returns were no longer under audit, unlike more recent years. Manafort deflected by turning the tables on Clinton. "Mr. Trump’s position has been clear from the beginning: He’s under audit. When the audit is completed, he’ll release his returns," Manafort said. "By the way, in Mrs. Clinton’s returns, you saw a lot of income coming from donors to the Clinton Foundation and people who benefitted from her State Department term as well. I haven’t seen any stories on that yet." Does the former secretary of state’s tax return really show pay-the-Clintons-to-play politics? Not exactly. About 15 percent of Bill and Hillary Clinton’s 2015 income came from two educational businesses with ties to the Clinton Foundation. It is a lot of money in raw dollars, but not a lot compared to the couple’s other sources of income. What’s more, we found no evidence that the firms paying Bill Clinton for his consulting work profited from the State Department, as Manafort said. According to their returns, the Clintons made about $10.5 million in 2015, the bulk from their speaking fees ($5.5 million) and book royalties ($3.1 million). Here’s a breakdown: Though the forms do not specify who paid the couple to speak in 2015, they do show that Bill Clinton also made about $1.6 million after expenses for consulting services. His clients were Laureate Education and GEMS Education, two international education firms that donated between $1 million and $5 million each to the Clinton Foundation. Laureate Education, a network of more than 80 institutions based in Baltimore, has also partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative "on a number of initiatives since 2008," according to its website. It named Bill Clinton an honorary chancellor between 2010 and 2014 (his tax returns do not show income earned from that role). The Laureate network is controversial partly for the stigma of for-profit education (which has been criticized by Hillary Clinton) and partly for racking up debt while marketing and expanding aggressively. Similarly, GEMS Education, one of the world’s largest private-school operators based in Dubai, is a Clinton Global Initiative strategic partner and, along with UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), is helping train principals in Kenya, Ghana and India. The company enrolls 150,000 students in 90 K-12 schools worldwide. Older tax returns show the Clintons received more money from the groups in other years. Bill Clinton was paid $16 million by Laureate and $5.6 million by GEMS between 2010 and 2014 for his consulting services. Politico has additionally reported that a former Clinton fundraiser who was given a special State Department post also had business ties to both firms. But while all of this demonstrates a strong link between Laureate and GEMS and the Clintons, it doesn’t prove corruption, as Manafort implies. His suggestion that they "benefited from (Clinton’s) State Department tenure" is not backed by the record. We searched www.usaspending.gov, a comprehensive database that tracks government grants and contracts, to see if either firm received not just State Department but any federal funding. Our search turned up nothing for Laureate or GEMS. (The Clinton campaign referred us to our previous reporting debunking the link between Laureate and the State Department.) The Clintons did disclose who paid for their speeches in 2013. Hillary Clinton received between $225,000 and $400,000 per speech from Wall Street clients such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, while Bill Clinton’s highest fee was $750,000 from a Swedish bank. Many of the firms have government interests, according to the Associated Press. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment to back up Manafort’s claim. Our ruling Manafort said, "In Mrs. Clinton’s returns, you saw a lot of income coming from donors to the Clinton Foundation and people who benefitted from her State Department term as well." The returns for 2015 do show that two educational firms that have donated millions to the Clinton Foundation also paid about $1.6 million to Bill Clinton for consulting services. That’s just 15 percent of the Clintons’ total income in 2015, but "a lot" of money to most people.

pomt-05065	Under the health care law, "everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/06/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-everybody-will-get-more-and-pay-/	In the debate over health care reform, a central question is whether the Affordable Care Act will live up to its name and make health insurance more affordable. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, said on Meet the Press that she welcomes the debate over repealing the law that Republicans promise. "They will ask for repeal," Pelosi said."Repeal of all the things I said that help children, help young adults, help seniors, help men or women who may have prostate cancer, breast cancer, whatever it is, any precondition. And everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access." That last line is a bold statement, because "everybody" covers a lot of people. PolitiFact has looked at Republican allegations that the law is bad because it will drive up premiums for most people and found those statements False. Pelosi’s statement allows us to make an assessment of the opposite point -- the law is good because everyone will save money. The Congressional Budget Office is designed to be the neutral analytic arm of Congress, and its study on how the ACA will affect insurance premiums is widely seen as the gold standard when it comes to projections. We called Pelosi’s office for background on her claim, and they pointed us to a CBO analysis of the law. Pelosi’s staff highlighted part of the report that states that for people who buy insurance on their own -- the individual market as it’s called -- rates will be 7 to 10 percent lower. Rates for those in the "small group" market will be 1 to 4 percent lower; and there will be little appreciable change for those in the "large group" market. That sounds like everyone either wins or is held harmless, but those numbers come with two important caveats. First, they are averages, and the personal experience of individuals within each group could be very different. This is just basic math. If my premium goes up 10 percent and yours goes down 10 percent, the average change is zero, but that doesn’t make my insurance more affordable to me. Second, the CBO did this section of its analysis assuming that people would buy the same kind of insurance they do today, without the new law. So if they have a $5,000 deductible and limited coverage today, the CBO analysts compared that to the rate they would pay in 2016 to get that same coverage under the law. But in its study, the CBO number crunchers actually predict that a large number of people will want to buy better insurance. They would opt for a lower deductible, lower co-pays and a wider range of benefits. That personal choice would cause their total premiums to rise some 27 to 30 percent. For a policy covering just one person, the difference would be about $600 a year, before accounting for any of the subsidies the law provides; over half the people in the individual market would qualify for those subsidies. Ed Haislmaier, a Senior Research Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a group that opposes the health care law, said he thinks the CBO rightly factored in how people might respond when they see what the law offers. Haislmaier said the law will make rates "artificially" low. When buyers see a discount, they increase their spending. "It’s like the store that sells jeans and has a sale with 50 percent off the second pair," Haislmaier said. "You end up buying two pairs." Haislmaier predicts that people over age 50 with some health issues will be the first to trade up and buy a more expensive plan because they would figure they’re likely to use it. Whatever the reasons, the CBO study estimates that 17 percent of people with insurance will see an average increase in premiums of about 10 percent. Of that group, more than half will see subsidies that will lower their costs considerably, and those people will pay less than they would today. That still leaves roughly 8 percent of people with insurance paying more. That is a national estimate. There have been a number of studies at the state level. One in Minnesota was done by team that included MIT economist, Jonathan Gruber. Gruber helped design the near-universal coverage program in Massachusetts under Mitt Romney and was a paid consultant for the Obama administration when the health law was being crafted. On average, in Minnesota, the great majority of people would come out ahead and spend less for their health insurance. Nearly 300,000 people would have health insurance who did not have it before. But still, rates would go up for about 100,000 Minnesotans -- slightly less than 3 percent of the total. These numbers might be on the mark or they might fall wide. Gruber describes the new law as "transformative legislation that will reshape the U.S. health care system for decades." And he says accurate predictions are "very difficult". But every analysis in every state finds that some people will pay more. Our ruling House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said "Everybody will have lower rates, better quality and better access." But even the study that Pelosi’s staff cited as the source of that statement suggested that some people would pay more for health insurance. Analysis at the state level found the same thing. The general understanding of the word "everybody" is every person. The predictions don’t back that up. We rule this statement False.

pomt-05916	"Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent during the president’s first year in office to 8.5 percent today."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/01/hank-johnson/spin-economy-data-leads-partisans-opposite-conclus/	Minutes after President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address last week, the Washington chattering class spun like a cartoon Tasmanian Devil. Republicans took to the airways, grumbling that Obama offered no real solutions to the country’s problems. Democrats cheered and said he had the answers. Then came the spin typical of any major political event, whirling with facts and figures. The economy’s better off since Obama took office, said U.S. Rep Hank Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat. "Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent during the president’s first year in office to 8.5 percent today," Johnson said in remarks posted on Patch.com’s local news site for Stone Mountain-Redan. No, the economy’s worse, said U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Marietta Republican. Three years into Obama’s presidency, "2 million more Americans are out of work," Gingrey said in a news release posted on Rome Newswire, an online news site covering the Rome area. Can these both be true? Is it possible for unemployment to drop as the ranks of people who are out of work grow? Because of this conundrum, we’ll depart from our usual Truth-O-Meter format and do a special doubleheader. We’ll check both stats and tell you whether one of them is wrong or whether it’s possible for both to be correct. First, let’s consider Johnson’s unemployment statistic. In January 2009, when Obama was inaugurated, unemployment stood at 7.8 percent. It peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, eight months later. In December 2011, the rate stood at 8.5 percent. Johnson’s numbers are accurate, but he runs into trouble when he said that "it is remarkable what President Obama has achieved in his first three years." Labor economists have repeatedly told PolitiFact that it’s hard for any political leader to take credit or blame for something as complicated as the economy. Johnson spokesman Andrew Phelan offered proof to bolster the congressman’s claim that Obama deserves credit for lower unemployment. He cited a November report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which reviews bills that will have an impact on the federal budget. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the stimulus legislation that Obama backed, lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.2 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points during the third quarter of 2011, the office determined. Phelan also cited a 2010 report by a Princeton professor and the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics saying the Recovery Act and monetary policy reduced unemployment. Still, other factors are at play. For this reason, Johnson’s statement earns a Half True. Now on to Gingrey’s statement, where he says "2 million more Americans are out of work." Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber pointed us to a July check by our PolitiFact Ohio colleagues. It analyzed a television ad by the Republican National Committee criticizing Obama’s economic policies. Since he took office, it said, "2 million jobs. Gone." PolitiFact Ohio found that the drop in employment was actually more severe than the ad said. The economy lost 2.5 million jobs between January 2009 and May 2011, according to employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks employment and other economic data. But the ad was missing a crucial piece of context. It neglected to mention that the economy gained 1 million jobs in the year before the ad came out. PolitiFact Ohio gave the claim a Mostly True. Six months have passed since PolitiFact Ohio’s story ran, so we checked the latest employment statistics to see whether the figures were still correct. We found that the country’s employment outlook is sunnier. In December, there were nearly 132 million nonfarm employees in the U.S., down 1.66 million from January 2009. This means that Gingrey’s 2 million figure is some 20 percent too high. We found a few other problems with Gingrey’s use of employment data. When the economy loses nonfarm jobs, it does not mean that "2 million more Americans are out of work," as Gingrey said. The Bureau of Labor Statistics did not design this metric to measure how many people have become unemployed. It’s likely many did get laid off. But others might have chosen to return to school, become stay-at-home parents or leave the workforce for any number of other reasons. It’s also worth noting that while payrolls have declined since January 2009, they’ve been rising since October 2010, according to BLS data. Because Gingrey’s claim cherry-picks unflattering data and his numbers could use some freshening up, we rate his statement Half True. Now we come to the larger issue at hand. Gingrey and Johnson used valid data to give opposite impressions of the state of the economy. Their interpretations had some shortcomings but weren’t wholly incorrect. So how is this possible? Can unemployment decline under Obama if payrolls shrank? Yes. The reason is that Gingrey and Johnson used data from different time periods. Gingrey chose to consider nonfarm payroll numbers starting in winter 2009, while Johnson started his unemployment count in October 2009. The economy didn’t post its worst numbers until the latter half of 2009. Between January 2009 and December 2011, the economy lost jobs. Nonfarm payrolls decreased by some 1.7 million jobs. As you’d expect, unemployment increased during the same time period from 7.8 percent to 8.5 percent. But from October 2009 to December 2011, the economy gained jobs. Nonfarm payrolls actually rose by about 2.4 million. Unemployment dropped from 10 percent to 8.5 percent. It’s easy to cherry-pick data that give opposite impressions of the nation’s economic health. With statistics, the devil’s in the details.	None	Hank Johnson	None	None	None	2012-02-01T06:00:00	2012-01-25	['None']
pomt-14075	Trade deals are negotiated in "secret" and, unlike corporate interests, politicians never invite "the leaders of the AFL-CIO or steelworkers or the mine workers to come in and sit down in these meetings."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/may/19/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-says-trade-deals-done-secret-and-wi/	In Ohio’s rancorous contest for the Senate seat currently held by Republican Rob Portman, the Democratic opponent, Ted Strickland, has regularly invoked the candidates’ stances on trade. He frequently calls Portman "the best senator China’s ever had." But at a campaign stop at a steelworkers’ union hall in Lorain, Ohio, Strickland said something we hadn’t heard before. "We need to stop politicians and special interests from negotiating trade deals in secret," Strickland said. "Now, I don’t know exactly how these trade deals are negotiated, but that’s a problem. The American people ought to know who’s in the room and who has some input. I do know that they consult with the corporate leaders. To my knowledge they’ve never invited the leaders of the AFL-CIO or steelworkers or the mine workers to come in and sit down in these meetings." Secret? And without union input? Our fact-checking curiosity piqued, we decided to dive in. Negotiated in secret PolitiFact has previously explored the biggest pending trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Five years in the making, the TPP sets new rules for trade between the United States and Pacific nations (not including China). The Senate voted to fast-track this trade deal in June 2015, meaning that legislators can’t amend the agreement hammered out by the White House. They can only vote for it or against it. But were the negotiations secret? We checked in with former U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, now a professor at the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland. She told us, basically, yes. "What you don’t want, or need, in a negotiation -- unless you intentionally want to blow it up or undermine your own side’s position -- is for the other side to know what your real motivation is, or what your bottom lines are," Schwab said. Because the TPP deal involves an incredible number of interested parties, the need to not let other partners know what terms each side has "won" in negotiations is essential, Schwab said. "Why would you want that?" she continued. "Then it isn’t a negotiation at all. You may as well give it all away and not expect to get anything back for American interests. That includes workers’ interests, manufacturing interests, agricultural interests, etc." But who’s in this clandestine club at the bargaining table? That brings us to our next question. Unions role in trade negotiations Schwab told us that union reps have the same access as corporate interests in trade negotiations. She knows because she was there. "I used to meet regularly with John Sweeney, when he was head of the AFL-CIO, along with his lead trade advisor at the time, Thea Lee, because they were on our official advisory committee for all of the negotiations we were involved in," Schwab said. There are well over 1,000 "cleared advisors" engaged in the trade negotiations process, Schwab said, in private sector advisory committees. While negotiations are ongoing, those advisors are sworn to secrecy. "They had security clearances and access to negotiating information," Schwab said. "They could meet with us in D.C. or come to Geneva or elsewhere, when negotiations were hot. Other labor union leaders, consumer group representatives, environmental groups and civil society representatives are there. So are industry, agricultural and service sector experts. Negotiators turn to all of these committees, along with members of Congress who represent them, and key Republican or Democratic staffers with security clearance and access to classified negotiating information and status reports, to get input and advice before and during negotiations." Union involvement in trade negotiations is nothing new. Lee, the AFL-CIO’s lead trade adviser, spoke about the process under President Barack Obama when she told CNN in 2015, "I've worked with the Clinton administration and I've worked with the Bush administration. And this administration is more secretive." In 2014, Obama tapped several union representatives to serve on the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, including Leo W. Gerard, member of the AFL-CIO’s Executive Committee, Joseph T. Hansen, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, and James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (and the late Jimmy Hoffa’s son). When we checked with Strickland’s campaign, spokesman David Bergstein sent us this issues statement from the AFL-CIO, which articulates the union’s frustration with their level of influence and access in trade agreements. Our ruling Strickland told a union hall’s audience, "We need to stop politicians and special interests from negotiating trade deals in secret. ... To my knowledge they’ve never invited the leaders of the AFL-CIO or steelworkers or the mine workers to come in and sit down in these meetings." He was correct that trade deals are negotiated in secret. However, when Strickland says that union leaders aren’t invited to have a say in these talks, he’s wrong. Union representatives are part of the advisory committees that have access to negotiators and politicians as these deals are worked out. They have similar access to the corporate leaders and business interests. How much of a difference they’re able to make -- that’s a whole other fact-check.

pomt-13696	"More than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton/clinton-tips-hat-bernie-sanders-uses-out-date-stat/	Hillary Clinton gave Bernie Sanders major respect as she accepted the Democratic nomination he worked so hard to claim for himself. Early in her speech, she praised Sanders for putting economic and social justice issues "front and center, where they belong." Clinton gave Sanders a nod again when she laid out her plans to invest in the nation’s bridges and highways, cut the cost of college tuition and make it easier for small businesses to get loans. She promised it all would be paid for. "And here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes," Clinton said. "Not because we resent success. Because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is." Clinton’s claim about who’s been getting most of the gains comes -- almost -- straight from Sanders. On the opening night of the convention, he offered a slightly toned down version saying "the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income." The problem is, when we looked into that, we found that the numbers are out of date. University of California Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez is the go-to source on income inequality. According to Saez’s latest data, the top 1 percent took in 52 percent of all income in 2015. As recently as 2012, the fraction was close to 90 percent, but here’s how things have changed since then: When we reached out to the Clinton campaign, they cited a fact-check we wrote in 2015. But as we’ve noted, the trend has changed. Inequality still exists, but not at the level the country was seeing before. As Saez explained in his most recent report, "In 2014 and especially in 2015, the incomes of bottom 99 percent families have finally started recovering in earnest from the losses of the Great Recession." Our ruling Clinton said that "more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent." That statistic was approximately correct a few years ago, but today, one of the nation’s leading authorities on income distribution says a more accurate figure is that 52 percent of all income flows to the top 1 percent. That still reveals a great deal of inequality, but not at the scale Clinton said.

pomt-01323	Says Rand Paul "has put out budgets to cut the military in half."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/26/adam-kinzinger/claim-rand-pauls-budget-would-cut-military-half/	Midterm elections are less than two weeks away, but the Sunday political shows were already peeking ahead to the 2016 presidential field. On ABC’s This Week, host Martha Raddatz asked a panel of pundits and politicians what impact Monica Lewinsky’s recent foray back into the national scene would have on Hillary Clinton’s chances. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who said he was a teenager when the Lewinsky scandal broke, didn’t bite and instead weighed in on the GOP hopefuls. "I think on 2016, by the way, I'd love to see Jeb (Bush). I'd love to see Chris Christie. I think Paul Ryan would be a great candidate," Kinzinger said. "The one person I don't want to see is somebody like a Rand Paul who has put out budgets to cut the military in half. I think that would be devastating for our party right now." That’s a tough critique of Paul by Kinzinger, an Iraq war veteran, but is it accurate? Rand Paul budget: Version 1.0 In his first year in the Senate in 2011, Paul introduced a proposal that was intended to drastically cut spending to balance the budget by 2016. To do so, Paul took measures to cut entire departments like the Department of Education, turn Medicaid and food stamps into block-grant programs and, yes, include a "draw-down and restructuring of the Department of Defense." "The resources and funding we provide to our national defense are unprecedented, however," Paul wrote. "Military funding has often far outpaced not only our most likely enemies, but has often outpaced the entire world’s military spending combined." He went on to say that the "structure of the U.S. military continues to reflect the build up during the Cold War," and proposed scaling back military personnel by not filling vacancies created by turnover, reducing overseas presence, and transition control of Iraq and Afghanistan to local governments. The end result? Defense outlays would drop from $712 billion in 2011 to $641 billion in 2012 and continue to fall to $548 billion in 2016. Paul accomplishes this largely by cutting overseas operational costs and war spending from $159 billion to nothing by 2016. The rest of the defense budget drops a bit but actually remains relatively flat. Overall, Paul’s budget represents a reduction in defense spending of about 23 percent compared to 2011 levels. That’s significant, but far from the 50 percent cut Kinzinger claimed. However, that’s not the only way to look at spending reductions. Department costs typically trend up annually automatically due to inflation, increases in the costs of production, raises, etc. The Congressional Budget Office, the top fiscal scorekeeper used by lawmakers, projected that defense spending would jump from $712 billion in 2011 to $773 billion by 2016. That’s about $225 billion more than Paul would have spent in 2016. In that sense, Paul reduces annual defense spending by about 30 percent. Still not close to "half." Paul’s budget went nowhere in the Senate. Only seven Senators voted for it with 90 rejecting it. Kinzinger’s office told PolitiFact that "a roughly 25 percent cut would reduce capabilities by roughly twice the overall number." Why? Because so much of the defense budget is fixed and can’t be reduced. The part that can be reduced, discretionary defense spending, is therefore taking twice the hit. Rand Paul budget: Version 2.0 A new budget proposal emerged from Paul in 2013: "A Clear Vision to Revitalize America." It emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into place. Those sequester cuts dramatically reduce non-war defense spending significantly during the next decade. The updated version of Paul’s budget again sought to balance the budget over the next five years. However, defense spending was somewhat spared, at least compared to the first incarnation and compared to the new budget projections post-sequestration. Under Paul’s budget, defense appropriations would go from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. So Paul’s final budget actually shows an increase in spending over the CBO’s 2014 projections, though, it’s about $100 billion less than what they project for 2023. Paul’s office noted, though, that this is because war spending is, again, reduced to zero (on the assumption, at the time, the United States was winding down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- so why include $100 billion annually for war spending?). The CBO projects that without war spending, the U.S. will spend $497 billion in 2014 and $589 billion in 2021. Paul’s baseline numbers for the defense department are higher than those figures. Our ruling Kinzinger claimed that Paul "has put out budgets to cut the military in half." In 2011, Paul released a budget proposal that reduced annual defense spending quite significantly, but not anywhere near 50 percent. There are different ways to measure the reductions, but they’re in the range of 25 to 30 percent. Paul later unveiled another budget that actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth. Both Paul budgets also eliminated funding in the defense budget for war spending and overseas operations based on the assumption that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were winding down. Lawmakers can argue whether that was prudent, however, it’s important context. Given all of that, we rate Kinzginger’s statement False.

pomt-14837	Says David Vitter "answered a prostitute’s call minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers who gave their lives in defense of our freedom."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/19/john-bel-edwards/phone-records-voting-record-back-claims-attack-ad-/	U.S. Sen. David Vitter entered the Louisiana governor’s race this year as the clear front-runner. But a prostitution scandal from years ago has left Vitter, a veteran Republican with widespread name recognition in the deep red state, in a difficult race against a lesser-known Democrat, state Rep. John Bel Edwards. In Louisiana’s open primary on Oct. 24, Edwards finished first among four candidates; Vitter was a distant second. Two weeks later, Edwards’ campaign released an ad called "The Choice." It highlights Vitter’s connection to "D.C. Madam" Deborah Palfrey, which was revealed in 2007 when an investigator working for Hustler obtained phone records from Palfrey and identified Vitter’s number. Vitter’s connection to Palfrey isn’t new. For years he avoided the issue after obliquely addressing it in 2007. It apparently had little effect on his 2010 bid for a second term in the Senate, which he won easily. But his connection to the D.C. Madam has percolated in this year’s governor’s race as new allegations emerged. Edwards’ ad, released the day before early voting began for the general election, put the issue on TV screens throughout the state. After it was released, "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd said it "might be the most vicious negative ad ever." The ad features a female narrator who says: The choice for governor couldn’t be more clear. John Bel Edwards, who answered our country’s call and served as a ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division, or David Vitter, who answered a prostitute’s call minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers who gave their lives in defense of our freedom. David Vitter chose prostitutes over patriots. Now the choice is yours. The ad makes two claims about Vitter: He skipped a vote for a resolution honoring American soldiers killed in the line of duty, and he answered a call from Palfrey’s phone soon after. It then concludes that Vitter "chose prostitutes over patriots," suggesting the two are related. The basics are not hard to substantiate. Then-U.S. Rep. David Vitter did, in fact, miss the vote in question. On Feb. 27, 2001, the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution to honor 28 soldiers killed in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, with 395 votes in favor. Two congressmen answered "present" but did not vote. Vitter was one of 35 marked absent. We asked Vitter’s campaign where he was that day, but the campaign declined to answer. There were no other roll-call votes that day, according to House records, nor were there any the day before, the first day after a congressional recess. That vote was recorded at 5:27 p.m. ET. Thirty-nine minutes later, at 6:06 p.m. in Washington, a call was placed from Palfrey’s cell phone to Vitter’s, according to her cell phone records. It lasted about a minute. However, the presence of a call on a phone bill doesn’t mean that Vitter picked up, rather than his voicemail. (If you find this fascinating, we recommend the podcast "Serial," which explores such issues in detail.) Vitter has never directly admitted or denied patronizing Palfrey’s service, though he’s come close. In 2007, after media outlets reported Hustler’s findings, he apologized in a statement for a "very serious sin" but didn’t elaborate. He’s been similarly evasive during this year’s governor’s race. In an ad his campaign released after "The Choice," Vitter says, "Fifteen years ago, I failed my family," but it elaborates no further. Asked this week during a debate if he took the call, Vitter refused to answer. Likewise, Vitter’s campaign did not respond to our questions about the ad. Edwards’ campaign did not respond to a request for additional evidence beyond what’s cited in the ad. (Palfrey died in 2008.) With Vitter unwilling to talk, we wondered if he was even in Washington that day, considering that Feb. 27, 2001, was Mardi Gras. That’s a big deal in Louisiana, and Vitter has expressed great personal fondness for the holiday. Considering that Carnival coincided with Congress’ winter break, it was possible that Vitter was back in Louisiana. But he was in Washington that night. As Louisiana State University Professor Robert Mann noted in a recent Salon column, President George W. Bush addressed a joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. Vitter is visible in the audience about 24 minutes in and a half-hour later. Moreover, a House report, detailing members’ use of congressional funds for office and travel expenses, shows that Vitter claimed an airfare expense that day. Flight records from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics show five direct flights from New Orleans to Washington-area airports that day prior to Bush’s speech. Arrival times ranged from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. There, our reporting on this track reached a dead end. Our ruling Edwards’ ad says Vitter took a call from a prostitute minutes after skipping the vote. The only thing we don’t know is if Vitter answered his phone. Even if he didn’t, he has still been connected to the D.C. Madam. "The Choice" doesn’t quite close the deal in suggesting that Vitter missed the vote because of his dealings with a prostitute, which is what it suggests when it says he "chose prostitutes over patriots." But the key parts of the statement in question — that Vitter "answered a prostitute’s call minutes after he skipped a vote" — are accurate. We rate this statement Mostly True.

Opponents have assailed the state’s tax incentive package, arguing the money could be better spent on road improvements, education and health care. They have also criticized the company’s need to divert millions of gallons of water a day from Lake Michigan. Some of the most prominent objections have focused on the potential environmental impact of the project, including potential air pollution and wetlands loss. Matt Flynn, one of several Democratic candidates vying to take on Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018, general election, voiced his concerns in a June 13, 2018 news release: "As I have said before, Foxconn is welcome to build its factory in Wisconsin and create jobs here, but not under the terms of Scott Walker's costly, corrupt, and unconstitutional deal. As governor, I will not allow Foxconn to take our tax dollars or circumvent the laws everyone else has to follow." He added this claim, which is one we want to check: "Foxconn will not face oversight from any federal, state, or local agency to guarantee it complies with our wetlands protection laws." The evidence When asked to provide support for the wetlands statement, Flynn campaign manager Bryan Kennedy pointed PolitiFact to a Jan. 3, 2018, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article, which begins this way: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says it has no jurisdiction over wetlands that will be filled as part of Foxconn Technology Group’s plans for a massive electronics plant in rural Racine County. The Corps’ decision could help hasten construction by removing a potential roadblock for construction of the $10 billion plant, which would have allowed for the public to offer comments on the permit and potentially push for changes in how the site is developed to avoid wetlands. Wisconsin lawmakers changed state law in September to accommodate the company by giving up state authority over wetlands on the Foxconn property. The Corps, however, still had the power to weigh in on the project. The legislation also exempted Foxconn from some environmental requirements, allowing the company to fill in wetlands that are regulated by the state and change the course of streams. So, the paragraphs from the article are mostly -- but not entirely -- on target with Flynn’s claim. However, further down, the article notes: "While the state would allow Foxconn to fill wetlands, that loss would require that new wetlands be created. Under existing law, for every 1 acre lost, a developer must create 1.2 acres elsewhere. The Foxconn legislation requires greater mitigation — 2 acres for every 1 acre lost." So, there are other environmental regulations at play. State Department of Natural Resources In short, there are some things the state has given up. But that does not mean there is no oversight on wetlands, as Flynn claims. The company has to replace the wetlands -- and do so at a higher ratio than other companies that are allowed to fill in wetlands. This is all covered in a $2 million "in lieu" fee that is part of the agreement. Foxconn paid the amount into the Wisconsin Wetland Conservation Trust, according to an April 25, 2018, state Department of Natural Resources letter. The in-lieu fee program, according to the DNR, involves the restoration, establishment, enhancement and/or preservation of aquatic resources through funds paid to a government or non-profit natural resources management entity to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements of permits. In a separate reference to its oversight, the state DNR Wisconsin Wetland Conservation Trust document stated the agency will oversee third-party construction of wetlands as paid for by Foxconn’s fee. DNR communications director Jim Dick said in an email that a total of 16.64 wetland acres under state jurisdiction were delineated in the area of Phase 1 of the Foxconn project. Thus, the $2 million would be used to create at least 33.28 acres of new wetlands. The expectation, he said, is that the new wetland areas will be created in the same watersheds affected by the loss of existing wetlands. The DNR website states "Foxconn is subject to federal wetland permitting requirements and must properly mitigate any impact on wetlands." Officials from Foxconn and Walker’s office both cited the same 2:1 ratio and $2 million payment by the company. Our rating In a news release, Flynn said "Foxconn will not face oversight from any federal, state, or local agency to guarantee it complies with our wetlands protection laws." The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that "it has no jurisdiction," but the state Department of Natural Resources says "Foxconn is subject to federal wetland permitting requirements and must properly mitigate any impact on wetlands." Indeed, Foxconn is required to mitigate wetlands at a higher ratio than other companies in the state. The bottomline: While some environmental oversight was removed, Flynn’s claim went beyond that to say there would be no oversight related to wetlands. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-15084	The University of Wisconsin System "is larger than any business in the state of Wisconsin."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/18/dale-kooyenga/rep-dale-kooyenga-says-uw-system-larger-any-busine/	As students return to campuses across the state, the impact of the GOP-led $250 million two-year budget cut to the University of Wisconsin System -- combined with the extension of a tuition freeze -- is drawing new attention. On some campuses, the cuts proposed by Gov. Scott Walker and enacted by the Legislature as part of the 2015-’17 budget might reduce the number of campus jobs available for students. Meanwhile, there have been layoffs and early retirement offers. State Rep. Dale Kooyenga (R-Brookfield), a member of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, defended the cuts during an Aug. 31, 2015 appearance on Charlie Sykes’ talk show on WTMJ (AM 620). "I think they can find ways to save money," Kooyenga said, adding that the Republicans who control state government chose the UW cuts instead of raising taxes. He expressed confidence that the system could handle the reductions because the cuts are small in relation to the UW System’s overall size. (The system’s overall annual budget is $6.1 billion). Kooyenga added: "The university system is larger than any business in the state of Wisconsin." That caught our attention, in part because there are a number of large Wisconsin-based businesses, including well-known names like Kohl’s, Menard and Johnson Controls. And, of course, there’s Walmart, which has several major distribution centers and 105 stores in the state, including 81 supercenters. There are a number of ways to measure the size of a business. Kooyenga’s aide Rachel Geary said her boss was using the most logical one -- number of employees. So how does the UW System stack up? According to its website, the system employed : 40,975 as of the end of fiscal year 2014. (A decade earlier the figure was 36,989.) How does that compare with the private sector? Kooyenga’s office offered several lists. For instance, one compiled by Newsmax, a conservative media outlet, said the top private employer was Eau Claire-based home improvement retail chain Menard Inc. ("over 10,000"). Also on the list was Epic Systems in Verona ("nearly 7,000") and Thedacare in Appleton ("over 6,000). Kooyenga’s office also forwarded an email from Walmart -- the nation’s largest employer -- that said the company has 30,095 employees in Wisconsin. Other big employers include Aurora HealthCare, with about 25,000 in southeastern Wisconsin. Menomonee Falls-based Kohl’s has about 10,000 employees in corporate offices and stores around Wisconsin, a company spokeswoman said. And then there’s the largest public company based in Wisconsin, Johnson Controls with about 3,400 employees in the Milwaukee area. All fall short of UW when it comes to employees. Another measuring stick There are other ways to measure the size of a business, including annual revenue. The UW System has annual revenue of about $4.8 billion, on a budget of about $6.1 billion. But the university system is not designed as a profit-generating enterprise. As such, there are plenty of public and private companies based in Wisconsin with higher annual revenue. For instance, Johnson Controls is at $42.5 billion, Milwaukee-based Manpower is $20 billion, Kohl’s $19 billion, according to their annual financial reports. S.C. Johnson, the state’s largest privately based company, has annual revenue of $9.6 billion, according to an estimate by Forbes Another key difference, of course, is that the UW System operates within Wisconsin. Geary, the Kooyenga aide, said it was misleading to compare the system with corporations that generate revenue around the world. "For example, Johnson Controls has a plant in China, then sells in China (and) that revenue is showing up at Johnson Controls," she said in an email. "But the vast majority of the revenue (especially with the US heavy tax burdened on overseas profit) never makes it to Wisconsin and the related employees are primarily outside Wisconsin. Compare that to UW where 99% of the revenue is received and spent in state." Our rating Kooyenga said that the UW System is "larger than any business in the state of Wisconsin." He’s right when you consider employment within Wisconsin, which is the most obvious way to make such a comparison. By other measurements, such as annual revenue, there are many Wisconsin-based companies that are larger than UW. But that creates more of an apples-and-oranges comparison. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Dale Kooyenga	None	None	None	2015-09-18T14:40:01	2015-08-31	['Wisconsin', 'University_of_Wisconsin_System']
pomt-07936	The health care law "is accelerating our country toward bankruptcy."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/27/paul-ryan/rep-paul-ryan-claims-health-care-law-accelerating-/	In the Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., touched on one of the most contentious issues in the health care debate: whether or not the new health care law will increase or decrease the deficit over time. "Health care spending is driving the explosive growth of our debt," Ryan said. "And the president’s law is accelerating our country toward bankruptcy." Contrast that with President Obama's claim in the State of the Union address, that "nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit." So which is it? Does the health care law reduce the deficit by a quarter of a trillion dollars or accelerate our country toward bankruptcy? Let's start with Obama's claim. In a Jan. 6, 2011, letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, wrote that repealing the health care law would increase the deficit over the next 10 years "in the vicinity of $230 billion." That's because while the health care law has a large cost -- mainly from expansion of Medicaid and subsidies to people of moderate means to help them pay for health insurance -- those costs are slightly more than offset by new taxes and spending cuts (most from slowing the growth of Medicare spending). Ryan and other Republicans, however, contend that the CBO report is based on gimmicks and double-counting and that the health care law will actually explode the nation's debt. The various arguments underpinning that contention are laid out in a press release on Ryan's website titled, "The Budgetary Consequences of the President’s Health Care Overhaul." Some of the points raised by Ryan are more legitimate than others. Let's address some of Ryan's main points: • "The CBO score did not include the cost of setting up and administering the massive overhaul, including the cost of hiring new health-care bureaucrats to run new spending programs, as well as thousands of IRS agents to enforce the new mandates." The release links to a CBO letter that estimates these discretionary appropriations would cost $115 billion over the next 10 years. That includes the administrative cost to implement new health care policies, as well as grants and other program spending prescribed in the law. And it's true that those costs weren't in the CBO's estimates regarding the budget effects of the health care law. But these are discretionary appropriations, which means Congress will determine each year how much of that cost it is willing to appropriate. Also, as the CBO pointed out in its letter to Boehner, "most of those authorizations, for more than $86 billion, were for activities that were already being carried out under prior law or that were previously authorized." Marc Goldwein, policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said just $10 to $20 billion of that $115 billion is actually tied to implementation of the new health care law. In other words, much of the rest is not new cost. • The new law double-counts $53 billion in additional Social Security payroll tax revenue and $398 billion in reduced Medicare payments. Ryan argues it's disingenuous to claim those revenues will be used to offset the cost of the health care law while also claiming they strengthen Social Security and Medicare finances. Goldwein agrees. "It's one or the other," he said. "You're either strengthening Medicare or using the money to offset the health care law. You are not doing both." But in a report, "Debunking False Claims About Health Reform, Jobs, and the Deficit," Paul Van de Water of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities dismissed the double-counting claim as a "canard." "In estimating the law’s impact on the deficit, CBO counted the Medicare savings and Social Security revenues only once," Van de Water wrote. "The financial status of the Medicare or Social Security trust funds is a different matter, distinct from CBO’s estimate of the impact of the legislation on the budget deficit. The skilled CBO experts did not double count, as anyone familiar with budget estimates knows." • The law uses an accounting trick to make a plan to create government insurance for long-term care, the CLASS program, look like a revenue producer. The program would start taking in premiums immediately but won't start paying out until 2016. As a result, it's expected to generate a surplus of $70 billion over the first 10 years. Long-term, the program could be quite expensive, but, because of a "timing trick," it looks like a revenue-producer over the first 10 years, Goldwein said. Regardless of the effect of the CLASS program, said Edwin Park, co-director of health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the big picture is that the CBO projects an even bigger deficit reduction from the health care law in the second 10 years than the first. The CBO projects that over the second 10 years, the health care law will reduce the deficit "in a broad range around one half percent of GDP." Obama and other Democrats have used that to estimate that the health care bill would cut deficits by over $1 trillion dollars in the second 10 years, but that's such a speculative number we rated Obama's claim Half True. Still, it's worth noting that the CBO anticipates even bigger savings in the law's second 10 years. • The plan does not account for the annual Medicare "doc fix" which the CBO estimates could cost the government an additional $208 billion. This relates to laws that limit the amount paid to Medicare doctors. Because lower payments (relative to the private market) could discourage doctors from accepting Medicare patients, Congress has regularly provided "doctor fixes" to bring payments closer to private market rates. One could certainly argue that this problem ought to be addressed in a comprehensive health care reform law, but it's also true that this problem would exist with or without the new health care law, which is why Democrats left it out -- it would certainly have driven up the cost of the legislation. • Even the government experts express skepticism that Congress can stick to the schedule of reduced payments to Medicare. In an April 22, 2010, letter, Richard Foster, chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, warned some of the estimated Medicare savings "may be unrealistic." "Simulations by the Office of the Actuary suggest that roughly 15 percent of (Medicare) Part A providers would become unprofitable within the 10-year projection period as a result of the productivity adjustments," Foster wrote. "Although this policy could be monitored over time to avoid such an outcome, changes would likely result in smaller actual savings than shown here for these provisions." And in his Jan. 6, 2011, letter to Boehner, CBO's Elmendorf wrote that "current law now includes a number of policies that might be difficult to sustain over a long period of time" including the law's reduced payments to Medicare providers. In other words, they aren't convinced Congress will have the stomach for the reduced Medicare payments over the long haul. In a House Budget Committee hearing on the fiscal consequences of the health care law on Jan. 27, 2011, Foster reiterated his concern that some of the estimated savings from Medicare may "turn out to be politically unsustainable over the years." Because of that and other factors, Foster said, "it is important to note that the actual future costs for Medicare are likely to exceed those shown by the current-law projections in this report. Foster was asked directly if it was true or false that the health care law would keep costs down. "I would say false, more so than true,'' Foster responded. In a letter to the committee, James Capretta, a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, warned that "if these taxes and spending cuts do not materialize, the new law will be a budget-buster of significant proportions." But not everyone agrees that the Medicare cuts are unrealistic. In a letter to the budget committee, Van de Water stated, "The record demonstrates that Congress has repeatedly adopted measures to produce considerable savings in Medicare and has let them take effect." And in a White House blog post, Stephanie Cutter, a top aide helping to guide political strategy on health care, responded to Foster's testimony: "Once again, we disagree. History shows that it is possible to implement measures that will save money for Medicare and the federal government." Again, some of these issues raised by Ryan are more legitimate than others. Yes, the CBO estimate did not include the administrative cost necessary to implement the new health care policies, but that comes to $10 to $20 billion. Most of the $115 billion cited in Ryan's press release are discretionary appropriations related to prior laws (in other words, unrelated to the new health care law). We also think there is some friendly timing that allows the CLASS program to look profitable in a 10-year window, even though it's likely to be quite expensive in the long-term. Still, we note that the CBO projects that over the second 10 years, the health care law is expected to reduce the deficit even more. Almost every expert from every side on the health care law would agree that there's a lot of uncertainty involved in projecting its budget impact. Looking strictly at the CBO's analysis of the budget effect of the health care law, it is a deficit-reducer, both in the short and long term. But Ryan points to several legitimate concerns about the assumptions made by the CBO -- particularly whether reduced Medicare payments are sustainable -- assumptions that even the CBO and Medicare's chief actuary noted may be suspect. The fate of those cuts may largely determine whether the new health care law ends up in the red or black. For now, though, those cuts are law. Congress would have to act to reduce or eliminate them. So Ryan is overplaying his hand when he claims the law is "accelerating our country toward bankruptcy." We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15071	There are a "multitude" of vaccines that do not prevent deadly and crippling diseases.	false	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/23/ben-carson/carson-wrong-vaccine-claim/	During the second GOP debate, Dr. Ben Carson backed up previous PolitiFact rulings when he said there is no correlation between vaccines and autism. But the retired pediatric neurosurgeon kept going and prompted another fact-check on the topic when he suggested that there are a "multitude" of vaccines that might not be necessary. "Vaccines are very important. Certain ones," Carson said. "The ones that would prevent death or crippling. There are others, there are a multitude of vaccines which probably don't fit in that category, and there should be some discretion in those cases." We contacted Carson’s campaign to see what vaccines he meant and his source but did not receive a response. Based on context, in which the candidates were talking about the shots given to children, we decided to look at the vaccines on the childhood schedule supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and our neighbors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommends a series of shots to protect children against 15 infectious diseases. They are measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Human papillomavirus (HPV), Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib), polio, influenza (flu), rotavirus, and pneumococcal disease. Most everyone likely knows about measles, the flu and the two types of hepatitis – and that all of those diseases can be deadly. But of the others, are any not lethal or, at the least, not crippling? Hardly. Several experts told us no such disease is prevented by those on the childhood immunization schedule. "Every one of those can kill or cripple or maim you," said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrics professor at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and one of three inventors of the rotavirus vaccine. And just what is rotavirus? Think of it as a particularly nasty stomach flu – one estimated to have killed 453,000 children under the age of 5 in 2008, most in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization. The others: Mumps – Death is rare, and happens usually in adults. But complications of childhood mumps include deafness and sterility in both genders. Rubella – A relatively mild virus that usually leads to severe birth defects and blindness and can cause miscarriage and stillbirth in expectant mothers. Chicken pox – Another relatively mild virus that killed 100-150 children annually before vaccines. Diphtheria – Once a major cause of death among U.S. children – including a record 15,520 in 1921 and the terror behind the original Iditarod sled-dog race in Alaska, this powerful disease killed a 6-year-old boy in Spain last year. Tetanus – This bacteria kills up to 20 percent of those infected, with many suffering from spasms severe enough to break bones. Whooping cough – A brutal disease that killed 20 in 2012, including 15 infants too young for the vaccine. The World Health Organization estimates it caused 89,000 deaths worldwide in 2012. HPV – The more controversial of all vaccines, largely because it prevents a sexually transmitted virus that can cause several types of cancer which can be deadly, even with treatment. HiB – A bacteria that can cause several invasive diseases, including meningitis, which that killed about 1,000 American children annually before vaccines. In 2008, it killed an estimated 199,000 children worldwide. Pneumococcal disease – One of the leading causes of illness in children that kills about 5 percent of those infected and leaves some survivors with permanent injury. "I would bet that any single one of these vaccines have saved more children than the number of lives Ben Carson has saved as a neurosurgeon," said Dr. Adam Lauring, a professor at the University of Michigan medical school who specializes in infectious diseases. "Because we don’t see many of these diseases anymore, they are almost perceived as inconveniences," Lauring continued. "But fact is, people do die of these diseases and we have forgotten that because we haven’t seen them." When they do appear, such as with last year’s measles outbreak, they are far less lethal disease than in year’s past. But that is likely a testament to technology and more ready access to healthcare than the fact the diseases remain incapacitating, said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at NYU’s Langone Medical Center and director of a project on vaccine ethics and policy. "High-tech medicine to pull you through but you still wouldn’t want to try to survive pneumonia in an artificial respirator in an ICU for weeks," Caplan said. "It’s still devastating." Our ruling Ben Carson, one of two medical doctors running for the GOP nomination, said during the second Republican debate that there is a "multitude" of vaccines for diseases that are not deadly or disabling. The diseases targeted by the vaccines recommended for children on a set schedule, however, are nearly universally lethal. The one obvious exception, rubella, is a disfiguring disease that can lead to birth defects. A medical doctor would surely know that. We rate Carson’s claim False.

pomt-01402	"The unemployment rate for young people is down from a 10.6 percent high in 2009 to 2.6 percent today."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/12/michelle-obama/unemployment-young-people-down-26-michelle-obama-s/	While campaigning for Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke for the second time in nine days, Michelle Obama took time to praise the presidential virtues of her husband. "By almost every economic measure, we are better off today than when Barack Obama took office. That is a fact," the first lady said Oct. 7, 2014 at the Overture Center for the Arts, near the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. "Here is just some of the proof; some of the proof," she said, with dozens of students clad in Badgers-red arrayed on the stage behind her. "Our businesses have created more than 10 million new jobs since 2010; that's including the 236,000 jobs created last month alone. And this is the longest uninterrupted run of private-sector job growth in our nation's history. Do you realize that? In our history." Then Obama made a claim of particular interest to many of those on the stage and in the audience: "The unemployment rate for young people is down from a 10.6 percent high in 2009 to 2.6 percent today." Whatever sluggishness there might be in the nation's economy, the overall unemployment rate has been coming down. But has the rate for young people dropped eight full points -- to just 2.6 percent -- in the past five years? "Youth unemployment" Attacking Barack Obama during the 2012 presidential campaign, Republican nominee Mitt Romney claimed that under Obama, "youth unemployment" was double the overall unemployment rate -- that is, 16.4 percent for people ages 16 to 24, versus 8.2 percent for people ages 16 and up. PolitiFact National rated the statement Half True. The two figures were correct, but the phenomenon wasn’t unique to Obama’s presidency. Youth unemployment had been roughly double the overall rate for every month dating back to January 2001, when GOP President George W. Bush took office. The first lady’s claim is slightly different than Romney’s in that she referred to young people not youth. But, as we’ll see, she misfired on the numbers. Sorting out the claim The relevant part of a White House transcript of the first lady’s remarks reads as follows: "The unemployment rate for young people is down from a 10.6 percent high in 2009 to 2.6 [6.2] percent today." The brackets indicate Obama transposed the numbers when she spoke. But even if 6.2 percent was the rate she meant to cite, the age group of the young people she talked about still wasn’t clear. After we exchanged several emails with The White House, a spokeswoman for the first lady eventually told us that Obama was referring to the unemployment rates for people ages 25 to 34 -- "a good proxy for young people out of school." Many folks would consider people in that age group young. Then again, many of the college students who saw the first lady in Madison might think 34 sounds kinda old. In any case, here from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics are the seasonally adjusted September unemployment rates for various age groups in 2009, the first year Obama cited, and 2014. The September figures are the latest figures available for 2014. Age group September 2009 unemployment rate September 2014 unemployment rate Overall (ages 16 and up) 9.8 percent 5.9 percent Ages 16 to 24 18.4 percent 13.7 percent Ages 25 to 34 10.4 percent* 6.2 percent *Note: The high rate for all of 2009 was 10.6 percent, in October. So, for people ages 16 to 24, and for those ages 25 to 34, unemployment was considerably lower in September 2014 than it was five years earlier. But not as low as what Obama said in her speech. Our rating The first lady said: "The unemployment rate for young people is down from a 10.6 percent high in 2009 to 2.6 percent today." But the latest figures, for September 2014, show the rates were considerably higher for two groups that could be considered young: 13.7 percent for people ages 16 to 24, and 6.2 percent for those ages 25 to 34.

pomt-04149	Says "our economy in New Jersey gets $38 billion from the businesses at the Shore."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/30/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-shore-businesses-provide-38-/	Gov. Chris Christie isn’t quite ready to free the beaches. As municipalities down the Shore seek financial help in restoring beaches damaged by Hurricane Sandy, two state senators have introduced legislation to prohibit towns that receive federal or state aid from charging beach access fees. The Republican governor said in a Dec. 19 radio interview that he still had to evaluate that proposal, and questioned how towns would pay for beach maintenance without charging fees. Those beaches are a key part of tourism at the Shore, which provides $38 billion in economic activity to the state, according to Christie. "I mean, why are we going to rebuild the beach? Because our economy in New Jersey gets $38 billion from the businesses at the Shore," Christie said on New Jersey 101.5’s "Ask the Governor" program. "The Shore ain’t the Shore without the beach." PolitiFact New Jersey isn’t entering the debate over beach fees, but we did find that Christie is wrong to attribute all of those tourism dollars to Shore businesses. That $38 billion figure applies to New Jersey’s entire tourism industry, and the Shore region is only responsible for about half of that amount. The estimate comes from a study released by state officials in March in regard to the economic impact of the state’s tourism industry in 2011. The bulk of the economic activity represents about $37 billion in visitor spending across all of New Jersey’s 21 counties on items such as lodging and transportation, according to the study. An additional roughly $1 billion includes other economic impacts, such as capital investment to build hotels and attractions, the study states. Of the roughly $37 billion in visitor spending, a total of nearly $19 billion, or slightly more than half, occurred down the Shore in Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May counties, according to the study. The remaining tourism sales were spread across the rest of the state, including about $2.5 billion in Bergen County and nearly $3 billion in Essex County, the study states. The governor’s claim in the radio interview was incorrect, but over the last several months, his administration has accurately cited visitor spending during 2011 in the Shore region. In an Aug. 23 news release, for example, the administration noted how tourism in Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Ocean counties "generated approximately $19 billion in visitor revenues." Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak didn’t question our findings, but argued that the governor has cited that $38 billion figure on other occasions in reference to the entire tourism industry. "Other times, the Governor and Lt. Governor have cited that same figure and spoken of the central importance of our entire state’s tourism industry to our economy," Drewniak said in an e-mail. "They have also noted that the largest slice of tourism dollars is generated by our Shore economy and 127 miles of beaches. "If you want to cherry pick this particular utterance, be my guest," he added. Our ruling During an interview on New Jersey 101.5’s "Ask the Governor" program, Christie said the beach will be rebuilt because "our economy in New Jersey gets $38 billion from the businesses at the Shore." But that 2011 figure applies to New Jersey’s entire tourism industry, from the northwestern stretches of Sussex County to the beaches of Wildwood.

pomt-15326	Despite what Donald Trump claims, "there weren’t 15,000 people who turned out in Phoenix" to see Trump speak.	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/15/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-donald-trump-exaggerated-his-cr/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump took his controversial but increasingly popular act to Phoenix, July 11, 2015, drawing a feverish reception among a crowd of Maricopa County Republicans. But just how big was the crowd? The ever-braggadocious Trump described an audience of 10,000 to 15,000 to 20,000 people coming to see him. The reality is the crowd was big, but not that big, as MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow pointed out. "I mean, no, there weren’t 15,000 people who turned out in Phoenix to see Donald Trump," Maddow said on July 13, 2015. "But there were a few thousand people. That was bigger than the other Republican candidates are getting, in terms of crowd size." Trump’s own Twitter timeline tells much of the story behind the event, with the rest of the details filled in by journalists’ accounts and our interviews with public officials. The event, hosted by the Maricopa County Republican Party (home to Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the immigration hard-liner who spoke before Trump), was supposed to be at the Arizona Biltmore resort hotel. But with larger-than-expected crowds, the campaign moved the event to the Phoenix Convention Center. Trump was excited about the buzz on the day before his Saturday speech, tweeting, "Look forward to being in Phoenix tomorrow at 2:00 P.M. Hottest ticket in entire country. Was supposed to be 500 people, now many thousands!" Media previews of the speech mentioned anywhere from 3,500-9,000 people were planning to come to the speech. As organizers began letting people in, a line wrapped around the convention center. Many people — hard to say how many, though some reports put it around 1,000 — were turned away. Arizona Republic national political reporter Dan Nowicki describes "bedlam in the ballroom" as Trump took the stage an hour after the planned start. In between insulting 23 people or things in his speech, as counted by the Washington Post, Trump also remarked about the size of the crowd. According to CNN, Trump said, "This is unbelievable. This began as 500 people in a ballroom in Phoenix." He also said the crowd "blows away" crowds for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whose recent crowds are drawing headlines. So how big was Trump’s showing? The Post put the crowd size at 4,200. CNN guessed around 5,000, quoting the Trump campaign as saying 15,000 tickets were distributed. But that’s not what Trump saw. Trump toasted the crowd on his Facebook page that night, writing, "This is what 15,000 people looks like." City officials started pushing back on Trump’s claim. In a statement shared with PunditFact, the city fire department said capacity for the North Ballroom was 4,200 people. The doors were closed at 4,169 attendees, said Phoenix Fire Department spokeswoman Shelly Jamison. "Once that capacity was reached, we closed the doors," she said. "The Phoenix Convention Center has a fire prevention specialist who is an expert on large events (e.g. Super Bowl Fan Fest, Comicon, etc) assigned specifically to the Phoenix Convention Center to enforce fire code compliance." Brahm Resnik, a TV reporter with 12 News in Arizona, questioned on Twitter why Trump would exaggerate an already respectable crowd size as he fact-checked Trump’s crowd-size claims in his reports. (Maddow played one of his reports before making her claim on the show.) Trump did not take kindly to the questions about his crowd size. He doubled down, tweeting July 12, "Convention Center officials in Phoenix don't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room." Also: "Phoenix Convention Center officials did not want to have thousands of people standing outside in the heat, so they let them in. A GREAT day!" The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment. For comparison sake, here is an image of the Bryce Jordan Center, home to Penn State University’s basketball team. Its listed seating capacity is just over 15,000. And here’s the widest picture of Trump’s Phoenix speech that we could locate. It comes from Charlie Leight of Getty Images. Our ruling Maddow called out Trump for exaggerating the size of his audience in Phoenix, saying 15,000 people did not attend his speech despite his claim on Facebook to the contrary. News stories and the city fire department back up her point. By many accounts, the crowd size and atmosphere was impressive, but it was about three times smaller than he described.

pomt-09672	Obama has "visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/19/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-obama-has-visited-more-countri/	We got a chain e-mail recently that purports to list 90 accomplishments from President Barack Obama's first six months in office. Unlike most chain e-mails we check out, this one was signed by its author, Robert Watson, a professor of American Studies at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla. Watson said he spoke last spring at some Democratic political clubs and was asked by some members to compile the list as talking points to balance some of the claims about the Obama administration coming from Republicans. The list has since gone viral, and now Watson fields several calls and e-mails every day challenging some of the entries. We decided to look into a handful of items on the list to see if they check out. Here, we look at No. 34, that Obama has "visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office." In the first six calendar months of his presidency, Obama did far more international travel than his previous five predecessors, according to an analysis by Brendan Doherty, an assistant professor of political science at the U.S. Naval Academy, for the White House Transition Project. In all, the study found, Obama traveled to 13 countries in his first six months in office. That's far more than George W. Bush, seven in 2001; Bill Clinton, one in 1993; George H.W. Bush, nine in 1989; Ronald Reagan, one in 1981; and Jimmy Carter, two in 1977. Obama has also met with more heads of state. According to Doherty's analysis, seven of Obama’s 13 stops were bilateral visits with the head of state of another country; while 15 of the 20 journeys made by Obama's five predecessors combined were bilateral meetings with other heads of state. "Examination of the first six months of President Barack Obama’s international and domestic travel reveals an active chief executive," Doherty concluded. "His record-setting pace of travel abroad reflects the many international challenges facing the United States at the beginning of his administration." The U.S. Department of State posts historical data on presidential travel abroad, which allowed us to look back even further, to the 13 presidents before Carter, all the way back to Theodore Roosevelt. None come even close to Obama's international travel record for the first six months. According to a Nov. 11, 2009 story by CBS News' Mark Knoller, who keeps meticulous records on presidential travel, Obama has traveled abroad more in his first year in office than any other president in history, and the year isn't even finished yet. According to Knoller's story, "Foreign travel by American presidents is a relatively new practice. No sitting U.S. president left the country until Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. He made a single foreign outing: a three-day visit to Panama in November of that year to inspect construction of the Panama Canal." Including his most recent Asia trip, Knoller notes that Obama has taken eight foreign trips to 20 countries. Make what you will of Obama's globe-trotting, Watson's e-mail is correct that Obama has visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office. We rate it True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2009-11-19T19:14:49	2009-11-19	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-15228	On allowing abortion in cases of rape or incest, "I have never said that or advocated that."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/aug/07/marco-rubio/rubio-said-hes-never-advocated-abortion-exceptions/	In the wake of the Planned Parenthood video controversy, several of the Republican presidential candidates weighed in about abortion during the first GOP primary debate on Fox News. Here was the exchange between U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and moderator Megyn Kelly on Aug. 6: Kelly: "You favor a rape and incest exception to abortion bans. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous. He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings. If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby?" Rubio: "Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all --" Kelly: "You don't favor a rape and incest exception?" Rubio: "I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States." PolitiFact readers asked us to fact-check Rubio’s claim that he never advocated for a rape and incest exception. Rubio’s record on abortion We soon found two Senate bills Rubio supported that includes exceptions for rape and incest. In November 2013, Rubio was one of 40 cosponsors of a Senate bill entitled "Pain-capable unborn child protection act." Several GOP presidential candidates backed the bill, including main sponsor Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and co-sponsors Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky. The bill bans abortions at 20 weeks or greater but includes exceptions, including rape and incest: "(1) where necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury, excluding psychological or emotional conditions; or (2) where the pregnancy is the result of rape, or the result of incest against a minor, if the rape has been reported at any time prior to the abortion to an appropriate law enforcement agency, or if the incest has been reported at any time prior to the abortion to an appropriate law enforcement agency or to a government agency legally authorized to act on reports of child abuse or neglect. …" The 2013 bill stalled in committee; Graham sponsored a similar version in 2015 -- and again Rubio is listed as one of dozens of co-sponsors. This version also has a rape exception, although the language differs. It requires for adult women to obtain counseling or medical treatment for the rape 48 hours before the abortion, with separate criteria for minors about reporting the rape to law enforcement. We asked a Rubio spokesman about his claim in light of the 2013 bill. "Marco has supported pro-life legislation with and without exceptions because they enhance protections for innocent life," Alex Conant told PolitiFact. "Pro-life groups supported that legislation -- Marco has a 100 percent rating from National Right to Life in the 112th and 113th Congresses, and a 100 percent rating from the Family Research Council in the 113th Congress." Rubio has long been an opponent of abortion rights, and his record bears that out. National Right to Life gave him a 100 percent rating for the 112th and 113th congresses. In both sessions, the ratings were based on five votes, such as cutting off funding for Planned Parenthood, repealing or defunding the Affordable Care Act and protecting free speech. The Family Research Council also gave Rubio a 100 percent rating for 13 votes in 2013-14. And NARAL, a group that supports abortion rights, gave Rubio a zero every year between 2011 and 2014. We found two examples of bills that Rubio voted for that did not appear to obtain a rape exception. In 2000, then state Rep. Rubio voted for a ban on late-term abortions, according to an article in the Miami Herald. The original version of that bill didn’t contain a rape exception, though it allowed a doctor to take steps to save the life of the mother. The Senate version of the bill had no rape exception, but it did have the exception about saving the mother’s life. That was signed into law by then Gov. Jeb Bush in May 2000. But within a couple of months, state officials gave up on enforcing the ban due to court decisions including a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. The other example is a 2013 U.S. Senate bill that is similar to Graham’s proposal to ban abortion at 20 weeks or later; however, it only pertains to the District of Columbia. That bill, sponsored by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has dozens of co-sponsors including Rubio. The bill makes an exception to save the life of the mother but not for rape or incest. In an interview after the debate, Rubio told CNN’s Chris Cuomo, "I'm in favor of a 20-week abortion ban. Does that mean I'm in favor of abortions at 19 weeks? No. Any bill that reduces the number of abortions is a bill that I'm going to support." Our ruling Rubio said during the debate about exceptions for rape and incest on abortion: "I have never said that or advocated that." Recently, Rubio has supported a bill that would have banned abortion after 20 weeks, and the bill did include exceptions for rape or incest. So Rubio has supported legislation with exceptions. However, we could find no evidence that Rubio has generally favored those types of exceptions, and we couldn’t find him specifically advocating for them. Rubio’s claim has an element of truth, but it leaves out important details. So we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/88dd3e38-cb9c-443e-848e-05f59ff0c3c9	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-08-07T14:52:06	2015-08-06	['None']
pomt-12202	"The person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from (Hillary Clinton) for wife!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/25/donald-trump/tweet-donald-trump-revives-charge-improper-ties-be/	In an early morning tweet, President Donald Trump revived an allegation he’d previously used against FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency until the president’s pick for a new director, Christopher Wray, receives Senate confirmation. The tweet said: "Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!" Trump’s anger seems to be that his campaign is being investigated for its communications with Russia while Clinton, his former opponent, is no longer in the political spotlight. But his tweet about Andrew McCabe is a significant distortion of the facts. And the implication that McCabe got Clinton off as a political favor doesn’t make much sense when we look at the evidence. The timeline In 2015, Dr. Jill McCabe, a pediatrician, was recruited by Virginia’s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, to run for one of the 40 seats in the state’s Republican-controlled Senate. McAuliffe co-chaired Bill Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign and chaired Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful 2008 run for president. According to the Wall Street Journal, which broke the story, McAuliffe and other Virginia Democrats met with McCabe and her husband, Andrew, on March 7, 2015, to urge her to run as part of an effort to take back the state Senate. At the time, Andrew McCabe was assistant director of the FBI's field office in Washington. He had focused much of his career on the fight against terrorism. The FBI released a statement that Andrew McCabe "consulted with top FBI headquarters and field office ethics officers for guidance, including briefings on the Hatch Act, to prevent against any actual or potential conflict-of-interest, in the event she decided to go forward." Based on that advice, the FBI said, when Dr. McCabe chose to run, Andrew McCabe and FBI lawyers "implemented a system of recusal from all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics, a process followed for the remainder of her campaign. During the campaign, he played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind." News that Clinton was using a private email account in violation of federal record-keeping requirements, broke March 2, 2015. McCabe announced her candidacy 10 days later on March 12, 2015. That July, the FBI was called in to begin a criminal investigation into the use of Clinton's private server at her home in New York. And that same month, Andrew McCabe was promoted to associate deputy director, the third in command at the FBI. He moved to FBI headquarters in September. Both McAuliffe, through his political action committee, and the state Democratic Party, donated to Dr. McCabe's campaign. In October 2015, McAuliffe's PAC, Common Good VA, gave Dr. McCabe's campaign a total of $450,000. (An additional $17,500 had been given earlier). The Democratic Party of Virginia spent $207,788 around the same time for mailings on her behalf. That would amount to 40 percent of the $1.7 million spent by the campaign. Two other Democrats running for other state Senate seats, Jeremy Pike and Dan Gecker, got larger amounts from McAuliffe's PAC. In November, Dr. McCabe lost her race to incumbent Republican Dick Black. On Feb. 1, 2016, three months after his wife's defeat, Andrew McCabe became the FBI's deputy director. In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI said it was the first time McCabe had any oversight role over the Clinton case. "Months after the completion of (his wife's) campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails," according to the FBI statement. Now let’s break down the elements of Trump’s tweet "The person in charge of the Hillary investigation" This is overstated. The FBI has confirmed that McCabe had an "oversight role," but it’s a stretch to say he was "in charge" of it. Then-FBI Director James Comey, not McCabe, made the decision that the Justice Department would not file charges against Clinton. Comey has repeatedly explained his decision under oath. McCabe "got" the money "for (his) wife" This is wrong. McCabe never "got" the money for his wife. The FBI ethics agreement required McCabe not to participate in fundraising for his wife’s campaign, or support of any kind. She worked independently to secure the funding for her candidacy. The amount was "$700,000" It wasn’t quite that much, but it was close. The money from McAuliffe’s PAC and the state party totaled $675,288. The money was "from" Hillary Clinton This is significantly misleading. While McAuliffe is a longstanding political ally of the Clintons, there has been no evidence that Clinton or her campaign were involved in the contributions or knew they were being made. McAuliffe’s interest in Dr. McCabe’s race is fully explainable by his personal desire to elect more Democratic lawmakers at the state level so that he could enact his legislative agenda -- not because of McCabe’s eventual role in an investigation that he hadn’t yet become involved in. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "The person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from (Hillary Clinton) for wife!" This tweet distorts key elements of the story, severely undercutting its accuracy. A Virginia state candidate married to an FBI official did get donations from a longtime Clinton supporter, McAuliffe, who was also the Democratic governor of Virginia. But the tweet ignores at the spouse played no role in fundraising for his wife’s campaign, and it ignores that that McAuliffe made the donations on his own, for state-level political goals -- not to influence an investigation that Andrew McCabe wasn’t even involved in yet.

pomt-12819	Says President Barack Obama’s nominees met a standard of 60 votes, "a standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices."	half-true	/illinois/statements/2017/feb/09/richard-durbin/durbin-oversimplifies-supreme-court-voting-process/	The morning after President Donald Trump announced Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe to share his thoughts about the president’s pick. Durbin, the Democratic whip and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in the interview he believes Gorsuch should have a hearing, but that the nominee also should meet the required voting standard. "(Gorsuch) should have a hearing and he should meet the voting standard that Supreme Court nominees are held to of 60 votes. A standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices," Durbin told the show’s hosts. With Senate Republicans considering the so-called "nuclear option" to lower the vote threshold needed to confirm Gorsuch, we decided to double-check Durbin’s declaration. Durbin has a point, but he does oversimplifies the process for Senate votes on Supreme Court nominees. Notably, a formal confirmation vote does not require 60 votes. Voting standard? Of the nearly 4,000 government positions Trump must fill, 1,212 require a Senate confirmation. That includes all Cabinet-level posts as well as hundreds of other senior positions and agency heads. Here’s how the confirmation process will work for Gorsuch: He will testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If the committee refers his nomination to the full Senate (a likely outcome due to the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee), a vote by the full Senate needs to be taken. The Senate majority leader moves to take the Senate into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. Then, the Senate majority leader needs to bring a nominee to a vote by the full Senate. In Gorsuch’s case, barring any outstanding circumstances, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee. However, if unanimous consent cannot be reached, and if at least one senator filibusters, Sen. McConnell would need to invoke cloture. A "cloture vote," agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. This confirmation process for some positions became less burdensome thanks to a rule change on Nov. 21, 2013. With the Senate’s Republican minority blocking President Barack Obama’s nominees for executive branch positions and, in particular, appeals court judges, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., triggered the so-called nuclear option by a successful 52-48 vote, eliminating the 60-vote threshold needed to confirm most nominations, and with it, the threat of a filibuster. The rule change, however, excluded Supreme Court nominees, meaning that such nominations could be filibustered. And that’s something that some Democrats have threatened to do against the Gorsuch nomination. The Republicans currently hold 52 seats in the Senate -- enough to reach the final vote threshold of 51 votes, but only if they can get that far. Now that we’ve addressed some background information about the nuclear option and current situation at hand, let’s take a look at Durbin’s claim. Nomination and confirmation of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan Following the election of Obama in November 2008, Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and essentially held 59 seats in the Senate because two independents caucused with them. In May 2009, Obama nominated U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Sonia Sotomayor of New York for the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice David Souter. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings began on June 1 of that year, and Sotomayor was confirmed by a vote of 68-31 on Aug. 6. Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts did not vote. He died on Aug. 25 -- 15 months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. If Kennedy had been present for the vote, Senate Democrats would have had a filibuster-proof majority. But that didn’t matter because nine Republicans voted to confirm Sotomayor. Then almost exactly one year later, Obama’s nominee to replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens, U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan, was confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 6 in a 63-37 vote, with five Republicans voting in favor and one Democrat, former Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, voting against. During the confirmation of both Sotomayor and Kagan, Democrats had a comfortable majority that was near filibuster-proof if not for the absence of Kennedy in August 2009 and the lone dissenting Democratic vote by Nelson in August 2010. On the surface, the margins achieved by Sotomayor and Kagan would seem to support Durbin’s argument that the confirmations required 60 votes. However, it’s more complicated than that. The nominations were never filibustered, so no 60-vote cloture motion was required. And the final confirmation required only 51 votes. In fact, two sitting justices -- Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas -- never reached 60 votes in their final tally. The key word that trips up Durbin is "standard." The existing Senate "standard" says nothing about reaching 60 votes. If the standard for passing a class is earning a C, and someone gets a B, it doesn’t mean that a B was required to pass the class. The "standard" to pass the class is still a C. Whether this longstanding standard lasts into the future, given the degree of polarization in Congress today, is another question entirely. Our rating In an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe show, Durbin said Obama’s nominees met a standard of 60 votes, "a standard that was met by Elena Kagan as well as Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's choices." Obama’s nominees cleared the procedural hurdles and won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010, and Sotomayor was confirmed in 2009 by a vote of 68-31. Kagan and Sotomayor ultimately would have had enough votes to be able to break a filibuster, but they never had to -- and the margins they got on the final, simple-majority vote can’t be used to retroactively define what the "standard" was.

pomt-01187	"A golf course closes somewhere in America every 48 hours."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/dec/05/bryant-gumbel/bryant-gumbel-says-golf-closes-america-every-48-ho/	Talking up a local golf course, an Austin American-Statesman reader caused us to look into a fade-shot claim from HBO’s Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel. Bob Brockmann said in a letter published on the newspaper’s editorial page Dec. 2, 2014 that he’d just watched an episode of the program revealing that "golf lost 5 million players in the last 10 years, and as a result one golf course closes every 48 hours in America." Brockman’s letter also said: "I am an avid golfer and hate to see this trend, but it’s a reality. Let’s try to fight the trend by keeping Muni open," he wrote, referring to the beloved Lions Municipal Golf Course in West Austin that could be developed into a mix of offices, apartments and shops. Fore! A golf course closes every 48 hours? In the HBO episode, which debuted in July 2014, Gumbel said: "On average, 130 courses have closed every year for the last eight years, from midwestern Michigan to the coast of California, from the tip of Florida to the top of Minnesota." Gumbel, describing the closings as the hangover after the sport’s explosive growth in the Tiger Woods era, added: "A golf course closes somewhere in America every 48 hours." By telephone, the producer of the episode, Nick Dolin, told us that according to the National Golf Foundation, 157.5 U.S. golf courses closed in 2013. That breaks out to one all-holes-down every 56 hours. "We took a slight liberty," Dolin said. "It’s a slight exaggeration." The foundation, which says it delivers independent market intelligence to keep golf businesses ahead, says on its "frequently asked questions" web page that as of Jan. 1, 2014, there were 15,516 U.S. golf facilities, as in complexes with at least one golf course. The foundation says that compares to 15,890 in 2010 and 16,052 in 2005. As of 2014, Texas was home to 790 facilities; Michigan, New York and California each had more with Florida leading other states with 1,048, according to the page. There were 157.5 course closures in 2013, the foundation says, with a course defined as having 18 holes, the number that makes up a round of golf. Still, 14 courses opened, the foundation says. Golf may be slipping in popularity. There were about 25 million golfers age 6 or older in 2012, the foundation says, compared to 30 million in 2005. By email, we sought more detail; a foundation spokesman, Marc Blatchley, replied by pointing out a January 2014 foundation newsletter story stating that in 2013, U.S. golf-course closings outpaced openings for the eighth straight year. Blatchley also told us that in Texas in 2013, the equivalent of 8.5 18-hole courses closed and 0.5 courses opened. The newsletter story said: "The overall reduction in supply is a gradual, natural market correction of the existing imbalance of supply and demand. Since the market correction began in 2006, there has been a cumulative net reduction of 643 golf courses… which represents a drop of about 4% off the peak supply year of 2005. "However, the cumulative decline over that period should be considered in context," the story said."Over the 20-year period from 1986 to 2005, U.S. golf grew by more than 40%, as more than 4,500 new courses were added." That’s a new course every 39 hours! (Ok, irrelevant. But par for this story, yes?) "Although there will be excellent new golf courses being built in the future, the gradual market correction is expected to continue for the next few years," the story said. Our ruling Gumbel said a "golf course closes somewhere in America every 48 hours." In 2013, actually, the rate was one 18-hole course closing every 56 hours and that’s before appropriately taking into account the year’s 14 reported openings, which means the nation experienced one less golf course every 61 hours.

pomt-01141	Two-thirds of the federal budget is "permanent law ... it's permanently appropriated."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/19/ron-johnson/most-federal-spending-permanently-appropriated-wis/	Contemplating January 2015 -- when his fellow Republicans will control the U.S. Senate as well as the House -- U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin drew attention to one of his favorite topics: the size of the federal budget. Johnson was interviewed Dec. 11, 2014 by conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on WIBA-AM in Madison. "Here's another reality -- and most people, unfortunately, don't understand this," he began. "All these budget fights are really only over a third of the budget. Two-thirds of the budget is permanent law." Johnson added: "It's permanently appropriated. Obamacare, Medicare, Social Security -- that's how government has grown and how it's always ratcheted up. Totally dysfunctional." We often hear about "discretionary spending" on the one hand and "mandatory spending" or "entitlements," on the other. But Johnson’s word choice gave us pause. Is two-thirds of the roughly $3.5 trillion federal budget "permanent law" and "permanently appropriated"? Budget breakdown Federal spending is divided into three broad categories: discretionary spending, mandatory spending and net interest paid on the federal debt. Since paying the interest on our debt is essentially mandatory, it is often included with mandatory spending, leaving us two major categories: 1. Discretionary spending is about one-third of the budget. It refers to government spending that Congress sets every year through the appropriations process. This portion includes spending for most federal agencies, such as transportation and health, as well as foreign aid and defense spending. 2. Mandatory spending is about two-thirds of the budget. It refers to spending that is controlled by legislation that sets eligibility criteria or spending formulas. This portion includes entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, in which you are legally entitled to benefits as long as you meet certain criteria. It also typically includes programs for which individuals automatically qualify, such as farm subsidies or veterans benefits. Unlike discretionary spending, which gets annual appropriations from Congress, mandatory spending is typically provided in permanent or multi-year appropriations. Therefore, the funding essentially becomes available automatically each year, without further legislative action by Congress. So, as Johnson indicated, two-thirds of the federal budget does not have to be appropriated annually by Congress. Rather, the spending is mandated by law, with the amount determined by how many people qualify. Johnson goes too far, however, when he says the two-thirds portion of the budget is "permanently" appropriated. When conservative columnist George Will said in 2011 that virtually all federal spending is "discretionary," PolitiFact National rated his claim True. Will had said: "It's all discretionary, other than interest on the national debt. Social Security is discretionary. We have the discretion to change the law. Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid." Indeed, it may not happen often, but mandatory spending can be changed at any time by passing new legislation that changes the particular program. In 1983, Republican President Ronald Reagan reached a deal with congressional Democrats to make changes in Social Security. The deal raised tax rates and gradually increased the eligibility age to 67 by the year 2027. The Affordable Care Act, adopted in 2010, reduced the increases in Medicare payments to hospitals and insurance companies. Johnson’s spokeswoman told us that in saying permanent, the senator didn’t mean that mandatory spending could never be changed. Rather, he was distinguishing it from spending that is allocated annually. Our rating Johnson said two-thirds of the federal budget is "permanent law ... it's permanently appropriated." It’s true that only one-third of the federal spending is done through annual appropriations bills approved by Congress, and that the other two-thirds is mandatory spending on entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare. But mandatory spending appropriations aren’t permanent. It isn’t easy, but Congress can make changes in the law that change spending within mandatory programs. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2014-12-19T09:00:00	2014-12-11	['None']
pomt-12241	Says Tom Barrett "has directed that tens of millions of City of Milwaukee tax dollars be used for the construction of a downtown trolley at the expense of: health and public safety; repair and replacement of public infrastructure; public education; and, job creation and economic development."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/14/save-our-city-milwaukeeans-cant-wait/tens-millions-tax-money-directed-milwaukee-streetc/	A newly formed group that wants Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett removed from office accuses him of "malfeasance" over the use of city money for a $128 million streetcar line. The group Save Our City, Milwaukeeans Can't Wait filed a notice with the city on July 7, 2017, that aims to force a recall election. In it, the group makes four charges against Barrett, starting with one about the streetcar, which the group refers to as a trolley. Barrett, the group claims in the notice, "has directed that tens of millions of City of Milwaukee tax dollars be used for the construction of a downtown trolley at the expense of: health and public safety; repair and replacement of public infrastructure; public education; and, job creation and economic development." The streetcar is mostly funded with federal transportation money specifically allocated many years ago for that purpose. But is the streetcar also getting tens of millions of city tax dollars that could have been used for things such as police, streets and schools? The group and the recall To trigger a recall election, Save Our City, Milwaukeeans Can't Wait would need more than 51,000 petition signatures within 60 days of the notice from eligible voters in Milwaukee. Candidates could then run against Barrett, a former Democratic congressman who was elected to his fourth term as mayor in April 2016 with 70 percent of the vote. The notice was filed by Milwaukee resident Allen L. Jansen, who did not return our call seeking information to back up the group’s statement about the streetcar. The group's treasurer, Darryl Farmer, told us he would not comment on the statement. Farmer, who is known as "King Rick" and leads the Original Black Panthers of Milwaukee, has been critical of racial inequities in Milwaukee, citing them when he threatened recalls without specifying any names in August 2016. Those threats followed an uprising in the city that occurred after the fatal shooting of a man by a police officer in Milwaukee’s Sherman Park neighborhood. As for recalls in Wisconsin, Barrett ran unsuccessfully against Republican Gov Scott Walker in 2012, when Walker became the nation’s first governor to ever survive a recall election. The streetcar Laying of the track for the 2.5-mile downtown-area streetcar project began in May 2017. Service for the initial route is expected to begin in fall 2018. Barrett and other supporters have said the electrically powered, 150-passenger streetcars will improve mass transit and attract commercial and residential development. Critics counter that the project takes development away from areas that are not on the streetcar line and that city residents would be better served by an improved bus system with the flexibility to readily change routes. When state Rep. Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna, said the streetcar would be a "1900s-style trolley," our rating was Half True. The cars will run on fixed routes on steel rails like the city’s old streetcar system. But they will be modern and are envisioned as a transportation system spurring economic development, not as some kind of nostalgic system. It’s clear from the city’s own streetcar website that tens of millions of city tax dollars have been committed to the project. Of the estimated $128 million construction cost, more than half -- $69 million -- comes from two federal grants specifically allocated for the streetcar. The other $59 million comes from three tax incremental financing districts (sometimes known as TIF districts or TIDs). That $59 million was authorized when the Common Council approved the project on a 9-6 vote in February 2015. So, it was not only Barrett but also aldermen who approved the TIF districts. But it’s not as though $59 million is being redirected from city coffers to the streetcar. Under state law, TIF money can only be used for development and redevelopment projects. TIF funding When then-Milwaukee Ald. Joe Davis said the streetcar "would actually take precious revenue away" from the Milwaukee Public Schools, our rating was Mostly False. Here’s why -- an explanation that applies to the recall group’s claim as well: With a TIF district, the city borrows money to pay for infrastructure improvements, such as new roads or, in this case, the streetcar line. The money is repaid through taxes generated by the increased value of properties within the district. In other words, those increased property tax dollars pay off the debt rather than going to the general funds of the city, Milwaukee County, Milwaukee Public Schools and other taxing bodies. Once the borrowing is paid off, the increased value of the land is added to the general tax rolls. Critics could argue that property values along the streetcar line would increase without the streetcar, and in that sense the city and other taxing bodies are losing that increased property tax revenue while the TIF is in place. But by law, tax money being collected through a TIF district can’t be used for other purposes such as police or schools. Moreover, if the streetcar does, as Barrett and others argue, spur downtown-area development, that will increase the overall property tax base. That would mean that once the TIF borrowing is paid off, there will be more property tax base for the city and the other taxing bodies than there would have been without the streetcar. Our rating Save Our City, Milwaukeeans Can't Wait says Barrett "has directed that tens of millions of City of Milwaukee tax dollars be used for the construction of a downtown trolley at the expense of: health and public safety; repair and replacement of public infrastructure; public education; and, job creation and economic development." Tens of millions of tax dollars are being directed toward construction of a downtown-area streetcar line, which is now under way. But it is in the form of borrowing that can only be done for projects such as a streetcar. These are not funds that would otherwise be available for purposes such as police and schools. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-05004	"When I was governor, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-achievement-gap-massachusetts-improved/	Mitt Romney heard both cheers and boos during his speech to the 2012 NAACP convention, where he vowed to "help hundreds of millions of middle-class Americans of all races." While acknowledging the unlikelihood of a Republican addressing the group in the midst of a race against an African-American president, Romney nonetheless declared that he is the best candidate to help black Americans. The former Massachusetts governor touted his own record on several topics, including education. He said he intervened in failing schools, promoted math and science and strengthened testing standards. "When I was governor, not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap," Romney, who served from 2003 to 2007, said. Romney’s education record in Massachusetts is uncharted territory at PolitiFact, so we decided to check it out. A little on Massachusetts schools We talked to several people knowledgeable about the school system in the Bay State, and all mentioned a 1993 landmark reform law that included the groundwork for the state accountability system (later called Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS), authorized charter schools and invested more money in local school districts. Its universal goal was to raise educational standards for all Massachusetts kids. Romney also referenced the reform in his speech to the NAACP on July 11, 2012: "In the years before I took office our state’s leaders had come together to pass bipartisan measures that were making a difference. In reading and in math, our students were already among the best in the nation – and during my term, they took over the top spot. "Those results revealed what good teachers can do if the system will only let them. The problem was, this success wasn’t shared. A significant achievement gap between students of different races remained. So we set out to close it." This was all happening in a place where student achievement regularly leads the pack. Massachusetts, which has a disproportionately high number of colleges and universities, some of the nation’s wealthiest ZIP codes and a well-educated workforce, churns out many high performing students. But the glare of those top achievers makes the shadow of struggling students that much darker. That is to say, Massachusetts still has a significant achievement gap. The term refers to the disparity in performance between certain subsets of students. White, middle- and upper-class kids consistently do better in school than African-American and latino and low-income kids in the U.S. And in Massachusetts, because the kids at the top do so well, it’s that much harder for everybody else to catch up. "Our scores are high, so as they get higher it’s pretty hard to move up," said Kathleen Skinner, a policy director at the Massachusetts Teachers Association, a teachers union. Narrowing the gap As backup for the claim in Romney’s speech, his campaign sent us a 2007 MCAS test results summary, and specifically pointed to 10th grade scores: 10th Grade Proficiency In Math o 2005, White: 29%; Black: 19%. Gap = 10 points o 2007, White: 29%; Black: 26%. Gap = 3 points 10th Grade Proficiency In English o 2005, White: 46%; Black: 30%. Gap = 16 points o 2007, White: 52%; Black: 40%. Gap = 12 points That shows the achievement gap narrowing by 7 percentage points in math and by 4 percentage points in English. But the gains in other grades are smaller. Among eighth-graders, the gap tightened by only 1 point in math and 2 points in English. For seventh-graders, the change was 3 points in math, 5 points in English. Sixth grade: 1 point in math, no change in English. In fourth grade scores, the gap narrowed by 1 point in math and widened by 1 point in English. (Some of those are comparisons between 2006 scores and 2007, the only years provided in the test results summary.) Skinner pointed out an important point about the MCAS: 10th-graders have to pass it in order to graduate. "They start paying attention," she said. We also took a look at scores for the following year, comparing the achievement gap between 2007 and 2008. (These charts offer a slightly different comparison from the previous year, which looked at students who scored "proficient" on each test. The 2007-08 chart includes those scoring proficient and higher.) The best gains again were made by 10th graders who narrowed the gap by six points in English. But there was no change in the gap in math scores, and lower grades showed only one- or two-point gains, or no improvement at all, and the gap widened in a couple of instances, such as eighth-grade science scores. The 2008-2009 test score summary reflected a similar trend: small gains in some subjects and small setbacks in others. Beverly Miyares, also with the Massachusetts Teachers Association, added that the dropout rate among black students in Massachusetts increased from 2002 to 2004, rising from 4.9 to 6.3. That means more under-performing students who dropped out of school didn’t drag down the overall average test scores. Romney’s role In claims such as this, we don’t just consider the accuracy but also whether the speaker deserves credit: How responsible was Romney for narrowing the achievement gap? "The most important point to make with Gov. Romney’s record is that the reform he initiated was part of a much larger and longer movement that existed in Massachusetts," said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent, nonpartisan research to inform public education reform in Massachusetts. Glenn Koocher, executive director with the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, which represents school boards, was less generous: "He had nothing to do with it. It’s the teachers in the classrooms who are making the difference." Skinner, the expert with the teachers’ union, added that Romney was "a somewhat absent ‘education’ governor. He was very agenda driven." "We would argue that he didn’t put anything in place" to narrow the gap, she said. We also wondered whether Romney had pushed any initiatives specifically aimed at helping minority students. Koocher and Skinner both mentioned charter schools, which are favored by many Republicans. "The charter school program was always popular among minority parents (and) any parents that wanted to get their kids out of the public schools," Koocher said, adding that vouchers commonly used to pay tuition at charter schools are unconstitutional in Massachusetts. Instead, the per-pupil state spending is deducted from the public school district’s budget. Ryan Williams, spokesman for the Romney campaign, said protecting the 1993 reform legislation was an important effort by Romney. He said there were attempts to repeal the graduation requirement, and Romney "stood firm on that and did not back down." "It was one of the bigger things we had success in blocking," Williams said. "A lot of what Romney did when he was governor was to preserve that legislation. He said, ‘I’m not going to roll these standards back." Skinner mentioned another, perhaps less obvious, initiative from Romney that helped many minority students: universal health care. Romney signed a health care reform law in Massachusetts that led to a 98 percent coverage rate. "In Massachusetts, all of our kids have health insurance, and I don’t think anybody should underestimate the impact that has on learning. Our kids get vaccinated, they can go to the dentist, they can go to the eye doctor," she said. "Their health is less of an issue than it is in other places." Our ruling Romney told the NAACP that when he was governor of Massachusetts, "not only did test scores improve – we also narrowed the achievement gap." State education figures over two years support Romney’s claim about learning gains, although it’s worth noting that some areas declined on his watch, such as the drop-out rate. And it’s always somewhat dubious to take a snapshot of statistics from only one or two years, when, as d'Entremont said "significant gains in student achievement don’t happen overnight, and the gains in Massachusetts are the result of a 20-year reform effort." What’s more, Romney, a single-term governor, should not get all the credit for improvement in the achievement gap, which is influenced by myriad factors. His statement is partially accurate but omits a lot of important information and overstates his impact. We rate it Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-07-18T11:22:22	2012-07-11	['None']
pomt-15195	"You’re more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas" than find in-person voter fraud.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/18/cory-booker/lightning-strikes-more-common-person-voter-fraud-s/	The Voting Rights Act turned 50 on Aug. 6, but the anniversary also doubled as an occasion for voting rights advocates to celebrate a new victory: The day before, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Texas’s 2011 photo ID law was unconstitutional, because it violated the rights of minority voters. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., went on ABC’s This Week on Aug. 9 to explain why he supported the decision: "Take Texas for example, where Lyndon Johnson's obviously from, they passed these voter ID laws. In the decade before it, 10 years, they only prosecute two people for in-person voter ID, only two people. You're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find any kind of voter fraud." We were surprised by the colorful comparison. So we decided to see if we could figure out whether lightning really is more likely to strike in Texas than people trying to cast ballots using fake identities. The odds In 2014, the National Weather Service gave the odds of being struck by lightning as 1 in 960,000. Their methodology consisted of taking the number of reported deaths and injuries (267) and then adding in another 63 estimated injuries, since not every injury caused by lightning will be properly reported, or even reported at all. Texas had the second-highest number of lightning-related fatalities from 1959 to 2013, behind only Florida. But that’s mostly because Texas is so big, both in terms of area and population; once you adjust the death rate, Texas actually ranks 33rd. An expert from the National Weather Service confirmed to us that the probability of being struck by lightning in Texas is slightly lower than the national average, right around 1 in 1.35 million. So how does this 1 in 1.35 million chance compare to the probability of finding voter fraud? To find out, we first counted up the total number of ballots cast from 2000 to 2014 using the Texas Secretary of State’s online record. The website includes presidential, congressional, and special elections, but skips over a lot of the more local ones. We came up with just about 71.5 million votes cast, but since the database isn’t comprehensive, we rounded up to 72 million (though that’s probably still an underestimate). Before delving into how many cases of voter fraud there are, here’s a quick definition. Voter fraud is "the intentional corruption of the electoral process by voters. This covers knowingly and willingly giving false information to establish voter eligibility, and knowingly and willingly voting illegally or participating in a conspiracy to encourage illegal voting by others," according to Lorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers and author of the book The Myth of Voter Fraud. Minnite goes on to distinguish between election fraud — which includes fraud perpetrated by other parties involved in elections, such as advocacy groups or election officials — and voter fraud, which is a subset of election fraud committed specifically by voters. Booker’s press secretary said he was referring only to in-person voter fraud, or voter impersonation, which is the type targeted by voter ID laws, and given the full context of Booker’s comments, that makes sense. Looking at the kind of fraud that voter ID laws aim to prevent excludes certain categories of fraud, such as those involving absentee ballots. A spokeswoman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent us information on electoral prosecutions. Since 2002, there have been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions resolved. Some of these were dismissed; others were classified as a pre-trial diversion, which generally means that authorities agreed not to charge the defendant. In total, then, there were 51 guilty or no contest pleas and 9 convictions, for a total of 60 cases of election fraud. Our next step was to identify how many cases were of in-person voter fraud. We reached out to experts who have studied these cases in detail. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said most of the prosecutions would not have been prevented by the voter ID law. "There were a bunch of prosecutions for unlawfully turning in a ballot that people weren't supposed to have possession. There are a few instances of marking someone else's ballot without their consent — those are all absentee ballots. There are a few of fake registration, or of voting while ineligible — none of which are stopped by a rule requiring ID at the polls," Levitt said. "There are vanishingly few instances of voter fraud — incidents flat-out, not just prosecutions — that could be stopped by applying a rule requiring ID at the polls." Minnite, the Rutgers professor, pointed us to 2012 court testimony from Major Forrest Mitchell, a criminal investigator with the Texas Attorney General’s office, in which Mitchell admitted that only about five of the more than 300 election fraud referrals that had been investigated since 2002 dealt with in-person voter impersonation. Mitchell’s testimony indicated that only two of these cases could have been prevented by a voter ID law. Three people were prosecuted, though, since one case involved two people. So Booker was off by one when he claimed two people had been prosecuted in the ten years before the ID law was implemented. Levitt, for his part, found only three credible allegations of fraud in Texas elections since 2000 that could have been prevented by an ID rule. Minnite found four cases of this kind from 2000 until 2014. Four cases of fraud for 72 million votes makes the chance of voter fraud 1 in 18 million. Our ruling Booker said, "You're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas" than to find in-person voter fraud. Since 2002, there have been a total of 85 election fraud prosecutions, not all of which have resulted in conviction. Only a small number of those cases -- four or possibly fewer -- included allegations of in-person voter fraud, also called voter impersonation. Those are the kinds of cases the voter ID law in Texas is aimed at preventing, and Booker is right that they have been less frequent than lightning strikes. Overall, we rate his statement True.

pomt-15127	"The State of Texas is funding … women’s health services at historically high levels; they just increased their level another $50 million for the next two years."	true	/texas/statements/2015/sep/04/joe-pojman/anti-abortion-leader-says-texas-funding-womens-hea/	At a Texas Capitol rally, an anti-abortion advocate suggested Texas has hit a record pace in funding women’s health. Video of the July 2015 rally shows Joe Pojman of the Texas Alliance for Life initially saluting Republican leaders for launching investigations in reaction to stealth videos showing Planned Parenthood employees talking rather casually about donations of fetal tissue. The videos had been circulated by the California-based Center for Medical Progress, which describes itself as a group of citizen-journalists dedicated to monitoring and reporting on medical ethics. Next, Pojman told the crowd, to cheers and applause: "I just wanted to emphasize, the state of Texas is doing its part... The state of Texas is funding … women’s health services at historically high levels; they just increased that level another $50 million for the next two years." Pojman noted that none of the $50 million would go to Planned Parenthood. "Texas takes care of our people and Planned Parenthood is not part of that picture," he said. Legislative cuts and changes, 2011-2013 Pojman’s declaration caught our attention in part because actions set in motion by the 2011 Legislature drove down family planning spending in the state budget by more than $70 million (from an existing two-year expenditure of $111 million) in 2012-13. Also in 2011, lawmakers voted to bar state family planning aid from going to health care providers affiliated with organizations that perform or promote abortions such as Planned Parenthood, whose clinics had been the Texas program’s biggest provider of contraceptive care and cancer screening, serving more than 40,000 women a year. Two years later, the state's ruling Republicans passed into law a bar on most abortions after 20 weeks of gestation and mandated facilities providing abortions meet tougher health and safety standards, a move under court challenge that has caused providers to predict a substantial reduction in clinics statewide. After the 2011 actions, the federal government moved to cut off what had been a 9-to-1 match of federal to state dollars paying to provide contraceptive care for women who otherwise would qualify for Medicaid if they were to become pregnant. State health officials said the affected initiative, launched in 2005, had saved the state money—$21.4 million in 2008, for instance—by reducing Medicaid-financed births. Federal aid accounted for $65 million of the money spent on the program in 2010-11. Reacting to the pending cutoff, then-Gov. Rick Perry announced state officials would assure such services were delivered through clinics not affiliated with abortion providers. The promised transition fully played out starting in 2013. So, given all this, could it be the state has set a record for expenditures on women’s health? Pojman’s backup cites state budgets We asked Pojman, executive director of the alliance, which says it opposes the advocacy and practice of abortion (except to preserve the pregnant woman’s life), how he reached his "historically high" conclusion. By email, Pojman responded with a chart, which he sourced to state budgets, indicating that nearly $285 million in state and federal funds budgeted by the 2015 Legislature for several women’s health efforts in 2016-17 would exceed such spending in each of the nine previous two-year state budgets, dating to 1998-99—with the previous record being $240.1 million for such programs in 2014-15. The previous low, per the chart, was $128.8 million in 2012-13. Pojman’s chart attributed the touted $50 million in fresh spending to a provision in the 2016-17 budget stating the money should "increase access to women's health and family planning services." In his email, Pojman told us that at the rally, he was referring to total legislatively appropriated state and federal funding, not per-person funding, on four programs providing family planning or female-specific health care such as breast and cervical cancer screenings. Conversely, he said, he wasn’t including funding for perinatal care, including childbirth. "Planned Parenthood," he said, "provides virtually no services for pregnant women, certainly not support for childbirth, except elective abortion." Four state-overseen efforts In his email, Pojman said a February 2014 Texas Health and Human Services Commission presentation amounted to a good summary of how the state spends money on women’s health. From that, we pulled these thumbnails: The Texas Women’s Health Program was put in place by the state starting in 2013 to provide services previously available through the defunct, federally supported Medicaid Women’s Health Program. The successor program, serving women living at or below 185 percent of the federal poverty level, "retains the same program objectives and client eligibility previously provided by WHP and has expanded program benefits to include treatment of certain sexually transmitted infections." Services offered in annual appointments include pelvic examinations and STD, diabetes, HIV, cholesterol, blood pressure and breast and cervical cancer screenings plus Pap tests, a clinical breast exam, contraceptives and family planning counseling. Family planning services, available to women of childbearing age and men living at 250 percent of the poverty level or less, offering the tests offered in the women’s health program plus sterilizations. Expanded Primary Health Care, a new program, offered to women 18 and older living at or below 200 percent of the poverty level, covering the services offered in the other programs plus immunizations, mammograms, diagnostic services for women with abnormal breast or cervical cancer test results, cervical dysplasia treatment, individualized case management and option prenatal medical and dental services. Breast and Cervical Cancer Services, open to women living at or below 200 percent of the poverty level, with breast screenings for women aged 50 to 64 and cervical screenings for women aged 21 to 64. In addition to services covered by the Expanded Primary Health Care program, BCCS assists clients needing to apply to Medicaid’s Breast and Cervical Cancer program. In addition, a chart in the presentation included spending figures that mostly aligned with what Pojman had offered to us for fiscal 2010 through 2015--including the legislated decrease in 2012-13 and a rebound in spending budgeted for 2014-15 (which ran through August 2015): SOURCE: "Presentation to Senate Committee on Health and Human Services: Texas Women’s Health and Family Planning Programs," Feb. 20, 2014 (received by email from Joe Pojman, Aug. 6, 2015) Other analyses support claim Next, we asked the commission and outside experts about Pojman’s rally statement. The consensus was that spending budgeted by lawmakers for 2016-17 would set a record, though some advocates cautioned this didn’t mean all needs would be met and others said that not all the described programs focus only on services typically provided by family planning clinics. To our inquiry, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission emailed a more detailed chart basically lining up with Pojman’s recap. From the commission’s figures, it looked to us like the appropriated 2016-17 funds for women’s health services exceeded previous two-year expenditures by $40 million or more. At the the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income residents, analyst Stacey Pogue said Pojman was on solid ground, though it’s complicated. For instance, Pogue said, the 2015 Legislature called for three women’s health programs to be reorganized in 2016 into two offerings overseen by the commission and precise spending results remain to be seen. By email, Pogue pointed out a two-page summary of the 2016-17 state budget prepared by the Texas Women’s Healthcare Coalition, which says it promotes access to preventive health care for all Texas women "working toward the vision of a state where every woman has access to the preventive and preconception care that will help her stay healthy and prepare for healthy, planned pregnancies." According to this June 2015 summary, $260.9 million in spending on women’s health care budgeted by lawmakers for 2016-17 reflected an increase of $46.5 million, or 22 percent, from what was budgeted for 2014-15. We confirmed the latest figures in the 2016-17 appropriations act approved by a Texas House-Senate conference committee; it shows $130,321,510 in budgeted spending on women’s health services in the fiscal year beginning Sept. 1, 2015, and $130,548,682 for the subsequent year, totaling $260,870,192 in the biennium. As noted by Pojman, the act also says that each year, on approval of the budget board, the commission shall allocate $50 million "providing primary health care services to women" including but not limited to preventive "health screenings such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension and STD-HIV screenings; family planning services including contraception; perinatal services; and dental services." Due to such spending, the act estimates that annually, 65,000 adults and adolescents would receive family planning services. It’s that additional spending, the coalition summary indicates, that makes the budgeted spending higher despite legislated reductions in spending for family planning (a cut of $1.5 million, or nearly 4 percent) and the Texas Women’s Health program (a cut of $2 million, or 3 percent). Alabama analyst Also to our inquiry, Heather Busby of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, which says it focuses on guaranteeing Texans the right to make personal reproductive health decisions including contraception and safe abortions, suggested we query Kari White, a University of Alabama at Birmingham professor and expert on women’s health issues who’s been part of a Texas-based team studying effects of the Texas decision barring aid to clinics affiliated with abortion providers. By phone and email, White agreed the state has allocated what looks like a record level of money to the efforts singled out by Pojman though she speculated by email the spending bump might be less dramatic than available figures suggest. "The focus on funding allocated for the four programs on Pojman’s list," White said, "does not entirely capture how some of the women’s health services historically have been paid for. For example, primary care services for women that are now covered by EPHC were previously paid for using other state-administered and federal programs (not included on Pojman’s list). By not factoring these programs into funding totals in previous years, the recent increase may seem larger than it actually is." Spending per woman "Also," White wrote, "funding allocations do not reflect how effectively these programs are serving women. In other words, there may be more total dollars set aside for services, but since quite a bit of this new funding has been going to organizations that do not have a lot of experience with family planning, the state is spending more but not necessarily serving more women." White suggested we consider research by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. In 2013, more than 1.7 million Texas women "were in need of publicly supported contraceptive services and supplies," according to a July 2015 institute report that started from U.S. Census Bureau survey results. That year, the report said, publicly supported health centers provided contraceptive care to 281,170 women in Texas plus 47,390 teens. "These totals amount to substantial proportions–but not nearly all–of the women in need of publicly supported contraception," the report said. For our part, we asked the commission for help estimating the number of Texas women eligible for the health services. Could it be that even with spending up, less money is available per potential beneficiary? By email, spokesman Bryan Black provided a chart, drawing on U.S. Census Bureau surveys, estimating the number of female U.S. citizens aged 15-44 living in Texas at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level from 2010 through 2017--in other words, the women who most likely would qualify for the health services. Next, we calculated that some $109 per potential beneficiary was spent in 2010-11 and 2012-13; this was exceeded by the $205 per potential beneficiary appropriated by lawmakers for such programs in 2014-15 and the $236 per potential beneficiary appropriated for 2016-17. Our ruling Pojman said the state of Texas "is funding … women’s health services at historically high levels; they just increased their level another $50 million for the next two years." Texas lawmakers this year voted to appropriate more for women’s health services than before--including the $50 million bump. This includes funding for general health services such as diabetes and cholesterol screenings. It also may be meaningful that programs are under reorganization. Too, lawmakers started putting more money on the table after their actions led the federal government to cut off tens of millions of dollars for reproductive services. We rate this claim True.

pomt-08482	Said state insurance commissioner candidate Ralph Hudgens "fights hard" to strip women of life-saving coverage such as mammograms.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/12/mary-squires/candidate-insurance-commissioner-says-rival-fought/	If you believe Democrats, state Sen. Ralph Hudgens, the Republican candidate for insurance commissioner, is trying to get between women and their mammograms. Hudgens' opposition, former state Sen. Mary Squires, lobbed this attack in news releases and statements to the media commemorating the beginning of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which is October. "Why would we vote for an insurance commissioner who fights -- and fights hard -- to strip women of life-saving coverages like mammograms?" Squires asked Morris News Service. Taking coverage of mammograms from women? Really? We took a closer look. Squires is one in a chorus of Hudgens critics on the subject. At about the same time she launched her attack, an anonymous video appeared on YouTube that pilloried him on mammogram coverage. A spokesman for the Squires campaign said it is not behind the video and does not know who is. The video juxtaposes an interview with a woman who says she owes her life to a mammogram with grainy clips of Hudgens saying he doesn't want to have to pay for the tests. "Why would I need to pay for maternity coverage?" Hudgens says. "Or why would I need to pay for coverage of breast reconstruction or Pap smears or mammograms?" "He wouldn’t even cover mammograms," a female announcer says. "And now he wants to be your insurance commissioner." This skirmish is part of an ongoing battle over whether Georgia law should require certain health insurance policies to cover mammograms, Pap smears, colorectal cancer screening and other services. These requirements are called "mandates." In the past, health insurance policies in Georgia failed to include coverage for women's health and other services. State legislators, especially the Georgia Legislative Women’s Caucus, rallied to institute mandates to fix this problem starting in the early 1990s. Hudgens ran afoul of the Women's Caucus because he co-sponsored SB 407 during the past session. The bill would have let Georgians buy health insurance policies across state lines. The idea of allowing out-of-state policies is popular among certain conservatives and insurance companies, but not with the bipartisan Women's Caucus. Its members battled successfully to kill the bill because they believed it would have undermined mandates by freeing insurance companies to sell policies governed by other states, some of which have fewer requirements. But state Sen. Judson Hill, a Republican from Marietta and the sponsor of SB 407, said his bill did not threaten coverage protected by mandates. No one would be forced to buy insurance across state lines, and some of the policies might be governed by states that have more mandates. But insurance industry advocates were concerned that SB 407 didn't do enough to curb mandates. They wanted state law to allow "mandate-light" policies, or policies that don't have to follow all the mandates. Georgia has one of the country's highest number of the requirements, which means that this state's policies would be too expensive to compete with cheaper ones from states with fewer mandates, an official with the Georgia Association of Health Underwriters said. Still, when Hudgens made the statements featured in the attack video in July, he was using fightin' words. They came during a primary campaign candidates forum hosted by the Northwest Georgia Association of Insurance and Financial Advisers and the Georgia Association of Health Underwriters. A longer video of his statement shows Hudgens said this: "Why would I, if I were buying an individual policy for myself, why would I need to pay for maternity coverage. And this costs you, in every policy. Or why would I need to pay for coverage of breast reconstruction or Pap smears or mammograms?" A few seconds later, Hudgens added "every time we have attempted to create a mandate-light policy, you got two groups of people that fight us and defeat us. One of them are the Democrats ... and the other one is the Women’s Caucus. Whether it be Republicans or Democrats, they fight against this, saying we’re trying to discriminate against women." When reached by AJC PolitiFact Georgia for this item, Hudgens told us he dislikes mandates in general because they drive up health care costs. He wants Georgia to let consumers buy plans where they can pick and choose the services they need without paying for ones they don't. "There is no way I'm against women," Hudgens said. "What I'm looking for is to change the way we buy insurance to tailor it to the individual." So it's not only true that Hudgens as a co-sponsor of SB 407 joined efforts to weaken mandates. He's a vocal opponent of mandates, and as chairman of the state Senate's Insurance and Labor Committee, he has a great deal of influence. And it's true that if SB 407 passed as originally conceived, the policies available to Georgians might not all have mammogram coverage. But would Hudgens' opposition to mandates have effectively stripped woman of mammogram coverage? As SB 407 sponsor Hill said, no one would have to buy out-of-state coverage. Mammogram coverage is so well-established it is possible but "unlikely" that plans would drop the coverage if it was no longer mandated, said Christopher Carpenter, an expert on economics and public policy at the University of California-Irvine who has studied state insurance mandates and mammography. Before state mandates, many women who did not have mammogram coverage got them anyway, Carpenter said. Still, the mandates appear to have an important impact since they began in the mid-1980s through 2000. Carpenter's yet-unpublished research appears to show that they increased mammography rates by about 8 percent. So it appears that more women do get mammograms if they have coverage. And it's reasonable to be concerned that the end of mandated coverage for mammograms could mean that it would be harder to get. Women could have to pay a premium to buy it. But saying Hudgens fought to "strip women of life-saving coverages like mammograms" is an overstatement. He fought to take away mandatory coverage. Squires' statement is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That means it meets PolitiFact's definition for Half True.

pomt-13862	"Many Nevadans relied on Uber for work, but after accepting $70,000 from taxi companies, Catherine Cortez Masto went after Uber ... (driving) them out of town."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/jul/07/freedom-partners-action-fund/super-pac-inaccurate-linking-nevada-senate-candida/	Catherine Cortez Masto is once again taking fire from a Koch Brothers-backed group attacking her record as the state’s attorney general. Freedom Partners Action Fund is spending $1.2 million on a new television ad campaign accusing the Nevada Democratic Senate candidate of "driving away jobs" by forcibly shutting down popular ride-hailing company Uber in Nevada. "Many Nevadans relied on Uber for work, but after accepting $70,000 from taxi companies, Catherine Cortez Masto went after Uber — once, twice, three times — until she drove them out of town, along with all their jobs," the ad says. Let’s be clear — Uber has been operating in Nevada for about a year. But is it true that Cortez Masto pushed out Uber and drove away jobs in 2014? No free rides Uber didn’t have the smoothest ride into Nevada. Speculation around the company launching was running rampant in 2014 as Uber eyed Nevada and tourist-friendly Las Vegas as one of the most lucrative markets without ride-hailing companies operating (Uber considered Nevada in 2012 but backed out). But Uber’s normal strategy of legally questionable, high-profile launches was a more difficult bar to clear in Nevada, where the closely-regulated taxi market is ruled by incredibly strict regulations. The rules include an explicit prohibition in state law on any company entering the market unless it can prove it wouldn’t "adversely affect other carriers operating in the territory." Nevada also has a confusing regulatory structure for overseeing cab drivers. The Nevada Taxicab Authority oversees Las Vegas, while the Transportation Authority regulates the rest of the state. Both regulators fall under the Department of Business and Industry, which Director Bruce Breslow said attempted to negotiate Uber’s entry into the market before it suddenly launched statewide on Oct. 24, 2014. "In the middle of trying to help them, they decided to operate without authority and illegally at the time in Nevada," Breslow said. Despite being told by regulators that Uber would need to apply under existing rules for new taxi companies, the company argued its non-traditional business model didn’t fall under decades-old state regulations. State officials disagreed, and quickly cracked down. Uber drivers caught by regulators were immediately cited and their cars impounded, and the Attorney General’s office quickly filed suit to shut Uber down. In an interview, a spokesman for Freedom Partners said Cortez Masto’s "overaggressive legal fight" justified the ad. "The reality is that Uber was operating in the absence of regulations, not in spite of them, and the state Legislature ultimately codified what Nevadans already knew: Uber is not a taxi company and should not be subject to their regulations," spokesman Bill Riggs said in an email. So how much wiggle room did Cortez Masto have in going after Uber, and was her legal strategy as overzealous as the ad claims? Jurisdictional fights The ad claims Cortez Masto went after Uber "three times" until the company was driven out of the state — a reference to three attempted requests for temporary restraining orders filed on the same day Uber launched. The requests, which were filed in Carson City, Reno and Las Vegas, created a legal mess with several justices attempting to claim the case, including one Las Vegas-based justice suggesting that the Attorney General’s office was "jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling." Nevada’s state Supreme Court eventually ruled on the jurisdictional fight, sending the case to a Reno district court, which promptly granted an injunction against Uber (the company soon after "temporarily suspended operations"). Freedom Partners claims this "overaggressive legal fight" drove Uber out of the state and cost jobs, but the truth is more complicated. Former Chief Deputy Attorney General Gina Session oversaw the Uber case. She said the office filed in three courts because they were pressed for time and weren't totally sure if an injunction filed in one jurisdiction would apply statewide — especially because Nevada has two geographically-based regulatory bodies covering the taxi industry. (Uber launched unexpectedly on a Friday). Former Deputy Attorney General Colleen Platt said the rush to file the suits that Friday meant they weren’t submitted with the usually required documentation, adding to the confusion. A panel of state Supreme Court justices called the multiple lawsuits an "inept effort" ignoring procedural rules, but didn’t find any evidence proving the office was searching for a more favorable court (though one dissenting justice said it gave "an appearance of improper forum shopping"). Former Nevada Transportation Authority chairman Andrew MacKay said the massive size of Uber’s workforce dwarfed the enforcement capabilities of state regulators, meaning the only real maneuver available was a court-ordered restraining order. MacKay, who disclosed that he’s supporting Republican Joe Heck in the state’s Senate race, detailed some of the issues with Uber in a three-page affidavit describing the more stringent requirements of Nevada’s cab companies. Although Freedom Partners argues Uber’s business model didn’t fall under existing law, state regulators unanimously agreed that Uber met the definition of a "common motor carrier" and needed to follow the applicable laws. Legal discretion, wiggle room The ad raises the question of how much discretion Cortez Masto had in going after Uber, and how much of the "blame" she deserves. Session said the Attorney General’s office generally serves as primary legal counsel for state agencies and departments, and that the actions taken against Uber fit Cortez Masto’s approach to her job. "This was generally the way our office operated," Session said. "Unless our clients were asking us to do something that was clearly illegal, we followed the will of our clients." MacKay, chairman of the state’s "client" in the case against Uber, said it’s theoretically possible that Cortez Masto could have ignored the will of the state and not filed suit, but it would have been highly unusual. "I couldn’t foresee the AG or any AG not enforcing state law," MacKay said. There are several high-profile examples of Cortez Masto’s discretion in which cases to take, twice determining not to follow through on requests from Republican governors on politically-charged issues. Freedom Partners also linked to a similar situation in Virginia that was resolved more peacefully. Donations & job losses As for the ad’s reference to $72,626 from taxi donations, Freedom Partners provided PolitiFact with a spreadsheet of taxi company donations to Cortez Masto between 2005 and 2010. PolitiFact double-checked the numbers and found them to be accurate, though close to $26,000 were "in-kind" donations which went to reserving billboard ads. Session did say she declined requests from taxi companies who wanted to latch on to the state’s lawsuit in order to avoid the appearance that they were doing the taxi industry’s bidding. As for the job losses, Uber at the time claimed that roughly 1,000 drivers lost their jobs "overnight" due to the state’s legal fight, though there’s no clear way to double check that figure. Regardless, Uber hired an army of lobbyists in 2015 and pushed through legislation allowing so-called "Transportation Network Companies" to legally operate in the state, roughly a year after the initial legal skirmishes. Our ruling A Freedom Partners Action Fund ad claims that Cortez Masto "went after Uber ... until she drove them out of town" after receiving tens of thousands of dollars in donations from taxi companies. Freedom Partners got a couple of the details right in the amount of taxi industry donations and Cortez Masto’s aggressive legal actions against Uber. But there’s a convincing argument that Uber at the very least bent the rules, and it’s clear that Cortez Masto didn’t have some sort of individual vendetta against the ride-hailing company — her office was working with state regulators who specifically requested the attorney general take action. The ad also neglects to mention how Uber only temporarily left town. The ridesharing service is very much up and running through Nevada a year after its initial skirmish with the state. Because this ad takes things out of context, we rate it Mostly False. Editor's note: This story was updated shortly after publication to clarify how the state Attorney General's office responded to Uber's launch on Friday, Oct. 24, 2014.

pomt-07142	"A large number of the uninsured earn $75,000 or more a year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/15/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-large-number-uninsured-make-mor/	Editor's note: We first published this report on May 17, 2011, and rated the statement True based on numbers from the U.S. Census. Since then, we've heard from readers who said other factors we did not consider weighed against Gingrich's statement. We have incorporated that additional information into our updated report and are republishing the item on June 15, 2011, with a new rating of Half True. When Newt Gingrich appeared on NBC's Meet the Press on May 15, 2011, the conversation turned to health care. Host David Gregory asked if Gingrich had been inconsistent about the role of the federal government in health care, because in 1993 he said he supported an individual mandate. The mandate -- a requirement that everyone have health coverage -- was the most controversial aspect of the health care law passed last year. Polls show the individual mandate remains unpopular with the public. Some opponents of health care reform oppose the mandate on the grounds that it gives the government too much power over health care decisions. There's also some disagreement among those who support health care reform about whether a mandate is necessary to reach near universal coverage. Insurance companies, though, say it's necessary if insurers are required to insure everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions. The mandate is currently being challenged in the federal court system. Gingrich said there was a difference from what he said 18 years ago because Obama "basically is trying to replace the entire insurance system, creating state exchanges, building a Washington based model, creating a federal system." Still, Gingrich didn't exactly back away from his previous position. "I agree that all of us have a responsibility to help pay for health care. And I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I have said consistently we ought to have some requirement, you either have health insurance or you post a bond, or in some way, you indicate you're going to be held accountable," Gingrich said. (The day after the show, Gingrich issued a video statement clarifying that he is "completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals. ... I'm against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone, because it is fundamentally wrong and, I believe, unconstitutional.") On the show, Gingrich expounded a bit on the problem of "free riders" -- people who go without insurance on the assumption that they'll still receive care if an unexpected emergency happens. "A large number of the uninsured earn $75,000 or more a year (and) don't buy any health insurance because they want to buy a second house or a better car or go on vacation, then you and I and everybody else ends up picking up for them," Gingrich said. "I don't think having a free-rider system in health is any more appropriate than having a free-rider system in any other part of our society." We were interested in checking Gingrich's statement that "a large number of the uninsured earn $75,000 or more a year." When politicians talk of the uninsured, it often conjures images of people who cannot afford health coverage. But Gingrich's point was that people who are relatively affluent are choosing not to have coverage. Why they choose not to have coverage is a complicated question, though. There's at least anecdotal evidence that even well-off people have problems finding an insurance company willing to sell them a policy if they have pre-existing conditions, even minor ones. Here, though, we wanted to see if Gingrich was right about the numbers. So we consulted the latest version of "Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States," an annual publication from the U.S. Census that creates detailed estimates of the national population and its health insurance status. In 2009, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the Census Bureau estimated that there were 50.7 million uninsured people in the United States, or about 17 percent of the total population. We originally noted that, "Among the uninsured, about 10.6 million made $75,000 or more. That number is about 21 percent of all the uninsured." Among the rest of the uninsured, the income brackets are as follows: • Less than $25,000: 15.5 million, or about 31 percent; • $25,000 to $49,999: 15.3 million, or about 30 percent; • $50,000 to $74,999: 9.4 million, or about 18 percent. However, after we initially reported this item, several of our readers told us that there are reasons to believe that number is high.The census figures are for household income, not individual income, so it's possible that some of the uninsured in households making more than $75,000 don't make that much on an individual basis. Young adults who are roommates might be counted in that category, or it could include multiple adults and children in a family that earns $75,000 as a unit and thus individual earners would not be considered affluent. A high proportion of the uninsured reside with other adult family members, so they might be more likely to fall into this category. We tried to find additional evidence or studies detailing how many of the 10.6 million uninsured might be single earners. We couldn't find data on this point. We did find one study that calculated the number of uninsured adults, aged 19 to 64, who were uninsured in 2009 but whose incomes exceeded 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $43,320 for a single person). The study, which appeared in Health Affairs, was conducted by John Holahan of the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center. The study's projections found that only 6 percent of that group were uninsured, or about 4.2 million people. But again, we can't say how many of those people were making more than $75,000. Still, we hesitate to discount Gingrich's point about an individual mandate entirely, because many health care analysts say that free riders -- people can afford insurance but go without, gambling that they won't get sick -- are a genuine problem for a health care program that seeks near-universal coverage. Insurers in particular say that if they must offer coverage to everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions, then there should be requirements that everyone buy insurance. In ruling on Gingrich's statement, he said that a "large number" of people make $75,000 or more and don't have insurance. The census shows that there are 10.6 million individuals who live in households that earn more than $75,000, and they constitute 21 percent of the uninsured. Because the census counts household income, it's likely some of these people are not making $75,000 on their own, but we don't know how many. We can't say if it's a lot or a little. Still, the census numbers suggest that at least some high earners are uninsured, and there's some wiggle room in what exactly Gingrich meant by "a large number." So we rate Gingrich's statement Half True.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-06-15T13:33:58	2011-05-15	['None']
pomt-09306	On running for the U.S. Senate as an independent.	half flip	/florida/statements/2010/apr/20/charlie-crist/crist-said-he-wasnt-thinking-about-it-now-he/	UPDATE: Crist announced April 29, 2010, that he is running for the Senate as a candidate "without party affiliation." So we have published a new item on this and rated it Full Flop. "I'm running as a Republican. I'm very proud to be from the party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, others that really have stood up for our party, like Ronald Reagan. This is a great party. It has a great future. We have a great opportunity to win in November. It's important that we put a candidate up that can win in November." (Q: So are you ruling out that you will file as an Independent by the April 30th deadline?) "That's right. That's right. I'm running as a Republican." - Gov. Charlie Crist, March 28, 2010 "I'm getting all kinds of advice. I take my cues from people in Florida. That's what I care about. I want to be very thoughtful in this. This is a decision that has to be made by (April) 30th, and I want to do what's right for the people of our state." - Gov. Charlie Crist, April 19, 2010 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gov. Charlie Crist's admission that he could skip the primary election for U.S. Senate and run as an independent in November has thrown political analysts and the GOP establishment into a frenzy. It also means that we get to unveil our first item for the Florida Flip-O-Meter. The Flip-O-Meter was created during the 2008 campaign to examine how a candidate's position on an issue has changed over time. We then declare whether the candidate has truly flipped using three ratings: No Flip No substantial change of position. The candidate has been consistent. Half Flip A partial change of position or inconsistent statements. Full Flop A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop. As PolitiFact editor Bill Adair pointed out back in 2008, we're not making a value judgment about flip-flopping. Some will say it shows inconsistent principles and lack of backbone. Others argue it's just pragmatism and willingness to compromise. In this case, we're examining Crist's statements on whether or not he'd consider an independent bid for the U.S. Senate. Under Florida law, Crist must declare whether he's running for the GOP nomination or as an independent by April 30. There's no sore-loser provision like in Connecticut, for example, where Sen. Joe Lieberman lost a Democratic primary in 2006 but was able to win the general election as an independent. If Crist ran as an independent, he could remain a registered Republican, and keep much of the money he has raised to date and use it for the November general election. While polls show him trailing far behind former House Speaker Marco Rubio in a GOP primary, he is even in a three-way November race with Rubio and likely Democratic nominee U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek. It appears the first published mention that Crist could run as something other than a Republican fell at the bottom of a South Florida Sun-Sentinel column on Jan. 3, 2010. The columnist, Stephen L. Goldstein was writing a piece about nine things Crist could do to reinvent or revive his political fortune now this his once insurmountable lead against Rubio had vanished. "9. If Charlie really wants to win the U.S. Senate seat, he could pull a Joe Lieberman and become an Independent. That would turn the race into a brawl. He'd draw Republican and Democratic votes -- and probably win," Goldstein wrote. The line, however, got little additional attention. It took another month, until February, for talk of a Crist-indie bid to get a full airing in the mainstream press. That was fueled by two polls in early February that had Rubio ahead of Crist by 12 and 14 points. At a news conference, reporters asked if he would run as a Democrat or an independent. "Not a thought in my mind," he said. By the end of February, still trailing in the polls, Crist said he was still running as a Republican, but didn't categorically rule out a run as no-party candidate. To a reporter for the conservative news website Human Events: "Some friends of mine talked to me about it, but I haven't embraced it. I'm running as a Republican." To the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald: "It's not something I'm thinking about," Crist said. "I'm comfortable about the race. I know what the numbers are, but we've got six months to go, and the public really doesn't know the opponent." Then came the March 28 debate on Fox News Sunday. Moderator Chris Wallace pressed Crist on his plans. (By now, pollsters were asking Floridians about Crist running as an independent). Here's the exchange: WALLACE: There have been persistent rumors in Florida that you are so far behind, at least currently, in the polls — double digits to Mr. Rubio — that you may run instead as an independent. Here is your chance to dispel all the rumors. Are you willing to pledge right here, right now that you will run in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate and not run as an independent? CRIST: I'm running as a Republican. I'm very proud to be from the party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, others that really have stood up for our party, like Ronald Reagan. This is a great party. It has a great future. We have a great opportunity to win in November. It's important that we put a candidate up that can win in November. WALLACE: So are you ruling out that you will file as an Independent by the April 30th deadline? CRIST: That's right. That's right. I'm running as a Republican. On April 8, 2010, Crist campaign manager Eric Eikenberg sent out a similarly strong and clear message. "To put these rumors to rest once and for all, as we have said countless times before, Governor Crist is running for the United States Senate as a Republican," Eikenberg said. "He will not run as an Independent or as a No Party Affiliation." “This should completely and utterly put to rest any of the unfounded rumors coming from the Rubio campaign that Governor Crist would run as anything other than the Republican that he is.” But it didn't. Not in the least. Crist, who was 46 percentage points ahead against Rubio in a Quinnipiac University survey last year, now trails in the same poll by 23 percentage points. Talk about a party switch only intensified after Crist vetoed a Republican-led teacher pay bill that would have linked pay raises to student performance infuriating many in the state GOP. Then, on April 19, 2010, Crist said he was considering a different course. Crist told the Associated Press that he could quit his GOP primary race and run for the Senate as an independent. Crist said in a phone interview he intends to be "very, very thoughtful and deliberate" as he makes up his mind. He told the St. Petersburg Times that "this is a decision that has to be made by (April) 30th, and I want to do what's right for the people of our state." And the The New York Times: "What I think is right for me to do is to be guided by the people of Florida, not by people in Washington, D.C.” So to review the change: Crist and his campaign repeatedly said he would run as a Republican, first during a debate broadcast nationwide on FOX News Sunday and then again in a campaign press release. And now, Crist says he is pondering a party switch ahead of an April 30th deadline. When asked how he would explain a no-party bid after repeatedly saying he would not do so, Crist said, "Things change." We'll be watching to see how this shakes out, and we're prepared to update our ruling. But for now it's clear that Crist has opened a door he once locked shut. We rate Crist's statements a Half-Flip.

pomt-12117	"Ted Kaczynski has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/18/james-peterson/district-judge-ted-kaczynski-has-less-restrictive-/	When a federal judge issued a sweeping decision to curb the use of solitary confinement, pepper spray and use of restraints at Wisconsin's teen prison complex, he included a sweeping claim to condemn the conditions at the facility: "Ted Kaczynski has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills," James Peterson, chief U.S. district judge for the western district of Wisconsin, said from the bench. Kaczynski, of course, is the Unabomber, the man that killed three and injured two dozen more in letter and bomb attacks. He is serving a life sentence at a federal "supermax" prison in Colorado known as the "Alcatraz of the Rockies." In issuing his June 23, 2017 ruling, Peterson said the problem with the use of isolation -- that is, solitary confinement -- as a form of punishment at Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls is "acute, immediate and enduring." The ruling was part of a lawsuit filed on behalf of inmates at the two facilities, which share a campus 30 miles north of Wausau. They house about 170 inmates. In the ongoing lawsuit, the inmates claim abuse by prison officials in the form of excessive use of pepper spray and confining inmates to solitary confinement for weeks or months at a time. A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation found state officials missed repeated warning signs at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake, where lax management, confusion over policies, lack of communication and chronic staff shortages contributed to the problems. Both facilities have been the subject of an FBI criminal investigation involving child abuse and neglect for two years. Prosecutors haven’t said whether or when they might file charges. Kaczynski is serving a life sentence at the ADX-FLORENCE prison for his decades-long letter and bomb attacks. The prison houses the nation’s worst offenders, such as Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. Is Peterson on the mark with his comparison? Lincoln Hills conditions Peterson declined to comment on his statement, since the case is still before him. However, documents in the lawsuit and court proceedings in the days leading up to his ruling shed light on the judge’s comments. For instance, the bulk of the arguments that preceded his comment focused on the use of solitary confinement. The lawsuit itself focuses on three issues separately: use of solitary confinement; use of pepper spray; and use of restraints. Between 15 percent and 20 percent of inmates at Lincoln Hills are housed in solitary confinement at any given time, according to court documents. The cells are 7-by-10 feet and, prior to Peterson’s ruling, inmates spent 20 hours or more -- sometimes an entire day -- inside them. Under Peterson’s ruling, prison officials have to give youth more out-of-cell time, according to the Journal Sentinel. When they are let out of their segregated cells for classes, many of those inmates were handcuffed to a desk, according to the lawsuit. These inmates receive an hour of classroom work a day, compared to the usual four to five hours. The court documents also claim the physical conditions of those cells are dirty and smell like sweat and urine. Meanwhile, pepper spray was used nearly 300 times throughout the prison complex, not just in solitary confinement areas, from January 2016 to April 2017, according to a June 9, 2017 Journal Sentinel report. In May 2017, the state acknowledged some of these claims in court documents, including that some youth have spent more than 180 days in solitary confinement and that staff had used pepper spray on youths who were already restrained. Wisconsin Department of Correction spokesman Tristan Cook said in an email that the department has made changes at the prison and that improvements are ongoing. Ted Kaczynski conditions Court filings regarding inmate treatment in the federal supermax in Colorado and reports by news outlets such as The Boston Globe, The New York Times Magazine and The Atlantic paint a bleak picture inside the nation’s most secure prison. Several of the prison’s 400 inmates spend 23 hours a day in a 7-by-12 foot cell that has a slot for food and small window slit, according to The Boston Globe. Inmates at ADX have claimed denial of psychological medical treatment. Todd Chapman, public information officer for ADX, disputed these reports in an email. However, we’re looking specifically at the Unabomber’s prison conditions, since that is the comparison Peterson made. In an email, Chapman said Kaczynski has a minimum of 30 hours a week outside his cell. Chapman also said that Kaczynski and other inmates are housed singularly and generally have a bed, TV, desk, stool, shelf and a storage area. Inmates at Lincoln Hills in solitary confinement had less outside time than Kaczynski before Peterson’s ruling, no access to paper or writing material, their lights are kept on 24 hours a day and they have few of the amenities that Kaczynski has. Those in general population at Lincoln Hills have access to a desk in their room, TV in the dayroom and are outside their cells for significant portions of the day. Our rating Peterson said: "Ted Kaczynski has less restrictive confinement than the youth at Lincoln Hills." His claim is on target for those Lincoln Hills inmates placed in solitary confinement, which was the issue at hand when the claim was made. The caveat: Those inmates not in solitary confinement would fare differently. We rate Peterson’s claim Mostly True.	None	James Peterson	None	None	None	2017-08-18T05:00:00	2017-06-23	['None']
pomt-11949	Trump’s tax plan is "completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful - not the middle class."	false	/new-york/statements/2017/oct/08/charles-schumer/does-trumps-tax-plan-do-nothing-low-income-earners/	Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer says President Donald Trump’s tax plan would raise the federal income tax rate for the country’s lowest earners while lowering it for the wealthy. Democrats oppose the plan, saying it benefits the rich over the poor. "It’s completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful - not the middle class," Schumer said on CBS’ Face the Nation. The plan’s framework is big on policy but scarce on details. So is Schumer right? Given the proposed changes to tax rates, brackets, deductions and tax credits, does the Trump plan focus only on the nation's wealthiest taxpayers? The tax rates Trump’s tax plan would increase the lowest federal tax rate, but it also would increase the number of people who don’t have to pay federal income tax. The lowest earners currently have a federal income tax rate of 10 percent. Those are single filers who earn up to $9,325 and married couples who earn up to $18,650 in 2017. Trump’s tax plan would increase the lowest rate from 10 percent to 12 percent. The White House hasn’t said what income level would top out that bracket. People in the highest tax bracket would pay a lower rate. Single filers who make more than $418,400 and married filers who make more than $470,700 are currently taxed at 39.6 percent. That rate would decrease to 35 percent in Trump’s tax plan. Trump leaves open the possibility of adding a fourth tax bracket for the highest earners. Adding another bracket means the new tax code "does not shift the tax burden from high income to lower and middle income taxpayers," according to the plan. Details on what that bracket would look like were not in the plan. RELATED: Are Republicans paying for tax cuts with reductions in Medicare, Medicaid? The deductions More people in the lowest tax bracket would not have to pay federal income tax under Trump’s plan. Most low-income filers already pay no federal income tax because their deductions are more than their reported income. Filers who make less than their total deductions do not pay federal income tax. Two major deductions benefit low-income filers the most: the standard deduction and personal exemptions. The current standard deduction is $6,350 for single filers and $12,700 for married filers. Filers can itemize their deductions rather than taking the standard deduction. Personal exemptions allow filers to deduct $4,050 for each taxpayer and dependent they claim, including themselves. The two combined equal a deduction of $10,400 for a single filer without children in 2017. The amounts change each year. Trump’s plan would eliminate personal exemptions but double the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married filers. That means any filer who earns less than those amounts would pay no federal income tax. Looked at in a different way, a single filer currently in the gap between $10,400 and $12,000 would no longer pay federal income tax. "The framework is basically taking the current 10 percent tax rate and increasing it to 12 but at the same time it’s effectively increasing the size of the zero tax bracket, at least initially," said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax policy think tank. Trump’s plan would replace personal exemptions with a higher Child Tax Credit, which currently allows a $1,000 credit for each child claimed. A tax credit is different from a deduction. A credit is a dollar amount put toward a filer’s total return while a deduction reduces the amount of a filer’s taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service says a tax credit is always worth more than a deduction of the same amount. The new plan does not specify how much the credit would increase. Who gets the best deal? Many of the tax changes would benefit high-income earners more than others, a report from the Tax Policy Center said. Some of the proposals, like ending the alternative minimum tax and estate tax, would benefit high-income earners disproportionately. About 80 percent of the total tax benefit would go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers by 2027, the report said. Their after-tax income would increase 8.7 percent. Taxpayers who make less than about $150,000 each year would see an average tax cut of half a percent or less by 2027 under the plan. Taxpayers who make between $150,000 and $300,000 would actually pay about $800 more on average in taxes. Taxes would increase for about a quarter of all taxpayers by 2027. The report estimates about a third of people making between $50,000 and $150,000 and close to two-thirds of people making between $150,000 and $300,000 would see a tax increase. The report partly attributes those increases to Trump’s plan to replace personal exemptions with a higher Child Tax Credit. Trading the deduction for a credit could leave larger low and middle income families worse off than the current tax code. That will depend on how much the Child Tax Credit increases under the Trump plan. Filers also would no longer be able to deduct state and local taxes from their federal taxes under the plan. That means residents in high tax states like New York could end up paying more in federal taxes. A report from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office estimates 3.3 million residents in New York would on average pay $5,300 more in federal income taxes if they were not able to deduct state and local taxes. More than three million of those residents make below $300,000, according to the report. About 1.8 million make less than $100,000. Our ruling Schumer said Trump’s tax plan is "completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful - not the middle class." Granted, there are lots of details missing from Trump's tax plan. But the plan presented so far does deal with taxpayers who are not wealthy. So in a strict reading of his claim, Schumer is saying the Trump plan has no changes, positive or negative, for low- or middle-income taxpayers. That isn't the case. It's possible that by "completely focused" Schumer meant the Trump plan benefits only the wealthy and the powerful. But that also isn't completely true. While many of the plan’s proposals would benefit the wealthy, doubling the standard deduction would mean more of the country’s lowest earners would pay no federal income tax and taxpayers earning less than about $150,000 would see a tax cut.

pomt-01531	Recently Rick Scott "closed 30 women’s health care centers across the state."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2014/sep/18/lois-frankel/lois-frankel-says-rick-scott-closed-30-womens-heal/	Democrats have been counting on a gender gap to win races in 2014, and Democrat Charlie Crist is part of that trend, lobbying hard for the women’s vote in his battle against Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Crist has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood PAC (despite his own mixed record on abortion in the past), has vowed to push for equal pay for women and now is attacking Scott’s record on funding rape crisis centers. Crist has also enlisted endorsements from Democratic women, such as U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach. Frankel recently penned a campaign fundraising email attacking Scott that was emailed out by the Crist campaign. "If Rick Scott wins, the next four years are going to be rough for Floridians," Frankel said in an email on Sept. 12, adding, "Recently he closed 30 women's health care centers across the state." This claim warranted a thorough check-up from the Truth-O-Meter -- and we quickly diagnosed the heart of the problem in Frankel’s words. Women’s health care centers We reached out to both Frankel and the Crist campaign. Neither could provide evidence for closed health care centers. The Crist campaign admitted the statement was an error. "That should have read ‘He cut funding to 30 rape crisis centers across the state,’ " Crist campaign spokesman Brendan Gilfillan said. Frankel's spokeswoman Majda Sarkic sent us this response: "The issue here is not about email wording. It is about Rick Scott denying Florida women and more specifically victims of sexual violence the healthcare they need and deserve." So the statement that Scott closed 30 women’s health centers is completely wrong. We decided to then look at what happened to funding for rape crisis centers under Scott. The state funds rape crisis centers through various pots of money. A portion comes from the Rape Crisis Trust Fund, which comes from fines assessed on felony criminal defendants. Since not all of the defendants pay what they owe, advocates have sought an additional stream of dollars from the Legislature. For several years, programs have shared a recurring amount from the Attorney General’s Office and in some years the Legislature and governor approved additional money. Based on our interviews with women’s advocates and state officials, here is the amount of state dollars that went to rape crisis centers statewide: Legislative session Money from state AG (usually from general revenue) Other general revenue Trust Fund** 2007-Crist $400,000 0 $1.5 million 2008-Crist $400,000* 0 $2 million 2009-Crist $250,000 0 $2 million 2010-Crist $250,000 0 $1.8 million 2011-Scott $250,000 0 $1.8 million 2012-Scott $500,000 0 after Scott vetoed $1.5 million approved by Legislature $1.4 million 2013-Scott $500,000 $2.5 million $1.3 million 2014-Scott $500,000 $2.5 million $1.3 million So why did Scott veto $1.5 million in 2012 but then approve $2.5 million in 2013 and again in 2014? In 2012, Scott’s veto during Sexual Assault Awareness Month drew some scrutiny. The Huffington Post quoted Scott’s spokesman at the time, Lane Wright. "This new funding of $1.5 million would have been duplicative, since, as a state, we already fund sexual violence programs," Wright said. "There was no information suggesting any needs in this area weren’t already being met." Representatives of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence met with state staff after the veto, said Jennifer Dritt, the nonprofit group’s executive director. "There were a number of people in the Legislature who spoke with the governor’s office about the need, and in 2013, there it was in his recommended budget," Dritt said. "We were never in any governor’s recommendation for funding until Gov. Scott recommended $2.5 million in 2013." A spokesman for Scott’s campaign cited a 2013 statement by Dritt praising Scott’s recommendation for $2.5 million. "This appropriation will make a world of difference in the lives of Florida’s citizens, and we’re grateful for his commitment," Dritt said. The increase in money has allowed some centers to hire additional staff which helped reduce waiting lists and expand services. For example, the Nancy J. Cotterman center in Broward used the $255,000 in new money over two years to hire a full-time crisis intervention specialist, part-time crisis intervention counselors and expand community outreach including to hospitals. Dritt said Scott’s veto did not cause any of the 30 rape crisis centers to close in 2012. Two centers have since lost certification and one chose to give it up while one new center was added, bringing the current total to 28. Our ruling In a fundraising email sent out by the Crist campaign, Frankel wrote that Scott "closed 30 women’s health care centers around the state." Crist’s campaign said that the email should have said that Scott cut money for rape crisis centers, but even that smaller claim isn’t accurate. More importantly, the statement that Scott closed 30 health centers is completely wrong. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!	None	Lois Frankel	None	None	None	2014-09-18T10:00:00	2014-09-12	['None']
